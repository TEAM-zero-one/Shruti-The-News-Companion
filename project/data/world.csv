'No degree of drama can conceal facts': India responds to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif's remarks at UN; slams 'absurd theatrics',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-degree-of-drama-can-conceal-facts-india-responds-to-pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharifs-remarks-at-un-slams-absurd-theatrics/articleshow/124174820.cms,"Pakistan PM Sharif’s UNGA Propaganda Parade: Fake Op Sindoor Victory & Nobel Call For Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday delivered a sharp rebuttal to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ’s speech at the UN General Assembly, dismissing his remarks as “absurd theatrics” and asserting that “no degree of drama can conceal facts.”Indian diplomat Petal Gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised Pakistan. “This assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the Prime Minister of Pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” Gahlot said.Pointing to Pakistan’s record on terrorism, Gahlot highlighted Islamabad’s role in the Pahalgam attack. “No degree of drama and no level of lies can conceal the facts. This is the very same Pakistan which, at the UN Security Council on 25th April 2025, shielded the resistance front - a Pakistani-sponsored terror outfit -- from the responsibility of carrying out the barbaric massacre of tourists in the Indian Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” she said.Recalling Pakistan’s history of sheltering terrorists, Gahlot said, “A country long steeped in the tradition of deploying and exporting terrorism has no shame in advancing the most ludicrous narratives to that end. Let us recall that it sheltered Osama bin Laden for a decade, even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism. Its ministers have just recently acknowledged that they have been operating terrorist camps for decades.It should come as no surprise that once again this duplicity continues, this time at the level of its Prime Minister.”Earlier in the day, Pakistan PM Sharif used his UNGA speech to echo Donald Trump ’s claims, saying the US President played an “active role” in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after military action in May.Sharif alleged that India sought “political gains” after the Pahalgam attack and accused New Delhi of targeting “innocent civilians” while remaining silent on Islamabad’s own support for crossborder terrorism.“In May this year, my country confronted unprovoked aggression from our eastern front. The enemy came shrouded in arrogance, and we sent them back in humiliation. India sought to extract political gains from a human tragedy by spurning my sincere offer of an independent investigation into the Pahalgam incident. Instead, it attacked our cities and targeted our innocent civilians. When our territorial integrity and national security were violated, our response was in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations charter,” Sharif said.Sharif also repeated his earlier false claim that Pakistan had shot down Indian fighter jets. He asserted that Pakistan’s forces responded with “stunning professionalism,” saying they repelled the aggression and “shot down seven Indian jets, sending them to scrap and dust.”In addition, Sharif raised the issue of the Indus Water Treaty , accusing India of violating its provisions.","Indian diplomat petal gahlot, exercising the right of reply, sharply criticised pakistan. “this assembly witnessed absurd theatrics in the morning from the prime minister of pakistan, who once again glorified terrorism that is so central to their foreign policy,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124175426,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41794,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

India rejects as baseless Nato chief's claim PM Modi quizzed Putin on war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-rejects-as-baseless-nato-chiefs-claim-pm-modi-quizzed-putin-on-war/articleshow/124170346.cms,"MEA: Suggesting a talk that never occurred unacceptable

NEW DELHI: The government on Friday dismissed as incorrect, baseless and unacceptable Nato chief Mark Rutte's claims that PM Modi , under pressure from the US tariffs on India, had sought an explanation from Russian President Vladimir Putin over his Ukraine strategy.The MEA said that at no point did Modi have any such conversation with Putin and urged the ""leadership of an important institution like Nato"" to exercise greater responsibility and accuracy in public statements.Nato secretary general Rutte had said in an interview US President Trump's tariffs on India were having a big impact on Putin. ""This (tariff) immediately impacts Russia because that means Delhi is now on the phone with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and Narendra Modi is asking him, 'I support you, but could you explain me your strategy because I have now been hit by these 50% tariffs by the United States',"" Rutte said.""We have seen the statement by Nato secretary general Mr. Mark Rutte regarding a purported phone conversation between PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin. At no point has PM Modi spoken with President Putin in the manner suggested. No such conversation has taken place,"" said MEA.Speculative or careless remarks that misrepresent the PM's engagements or suggest conversations that never occurred are unacceptable, MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal added.Since the Russia-Ukraine war began in 2022, India has significantly increased its import of Russian crude oil available at discounted rate. Trump had said India's oil imports were helping fund the war.The spokesperson said that, as previously stated, India's energy imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to Indian consumer. ""India will continue taking necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,"" he said.President Trump had earlier imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian oil, accusing New Delhi of bankrolling Moscow's war on Ukraine, a move that India describes as unjustified because the US has not taken similar action against other countries like China that continue to procure crude from Russia.","Mea: suggesting a talk that never occurred unacceptable.

All isn't well with how Sonam Wangchuk's career has gone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-isnt-well-with-how-sonam-wangchuks-career-has-gone/articleshow/124167300.cms,"SRINAGAR: Phunsukh Wangdu, the protagonist of the cult 2009 film 3 Idiots, would famously work his way out of trouble with ""All izz well"". Ladakhi Sonam Wangchuk , said to be the inspiration behind the endearing character essayed by Aamir Khan, has since gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.Wangchuk, variously described as an innovator, activist and climate warrior, did not stumble into politics overnight.Four months after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, he released a video thanking PM Narendra Modi for making Ladakh a Union territory, albeit with a veiled warning. ""People here have started asking whether UT status was granted to exploit Ladakh's vast resources, and whether our resources will be exploited the way China does in Tibet,"" Wangchuk said, urging the Centre to safeguard the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.In January 2023, he announced a five-day climate fast at Khardung La, one of the world's highest passes, where winter temperatures plunge to minus 40 degrees Celsius. The administration prevented him from reaching the site, forcing him to pitch tent in Leh instead. The protest, complete with political speeches, music, solidarity gatherings and anti-establishment rap, galvanised Wangchuk's mission.A year later, in October 2024, he ended another 16-day fast only after the Union home ministry agreed to resume talks with Ladakhi organisations.After negotiations stalled, he launched a new 35-day hunger strike on Sept 10 this year, demanding statehood for Ladakh with Sixth Schedule safeguards. ""It's possible that we might die. If we survive, we will return for another hunger strike of six weeks,"" he declared.Last Wednesday, he called off the fast after violent protests erupted across the region, leaving four dead and dozens injured.Born in 1966 in a village near Leh, Wangchuk had been homeschooled until he was nine. In 1975, after his father Sonam Wangyal became a minister in the then J&K govt, the family moved to Srinagar. He later studied engineering at NIT Srinagar and got another degree from CRATerre School of Architecture in Grenoble, France.In 1988, Wangchuk co-founded the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh to reform the education system. He argued that Ladakhi children, struggling with textbooks designed for other regions, were being unfairly labelled poor performers.Wangchuk's activism and political discourse in Ladakh now run parallel. The roots of the present turmoil lie in the 2020 Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council polls, when most political parties called for a poll boycott until Sixth Schedule protection was granted.By 2021, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance emerged, uniting religious and political groups to demand safeguards for Ladakh's indigenous people. Though Wangchuk acted independently, both organisations supported his campaign.","Ladakhi sonam wangchuk has gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.

As far as mediation is concerned, there too, there is no need for any third party to mediate on the bilateral issues between India and Pakistan,"" Jaiswal said.These remarks came after Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue during the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, where he said that Turkey was “pleased” with the ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan.The Turkish president had also urged the dispute to be resolved “on the basis of UN resolutions” through dialogue. His statement was similar to previous support for Pakistan, including during an earlier visit to Islamabad, which India had sharply criticised.Jaiswal described Erdogan’s comments as “objectionable” and said India had lodged a strong protest with the Turkish ambassador. “Such unwarranted statements on India's territorial integrity and sovereignty are unacceptable,” he added.The minister also pointed out that the root of the problem in Jammu and Kashmir is Pakistan’s actions. “It would have been better if Pakistan's policy of using cross-border terrorism against India, which remains the biggest threat to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, had been called out.”Separately, Jaiswal noted that EAM S Jaishankar recently met his Cypriot counterpart, reaffirming India’s support for a “comprehensive and lasting settlement” in North Cyprus based on the UN framework.On the sidelines of UNGA in New York, Jaishankar also met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. They discussed strengthening India-US relations, promoting a free and inclusive Indo-Pacific under the Quad, and cooperation on trade, energy, and critical minerals.India’s firm response comes amid growing ties between Ankara and Islamabad, including reports that Turkish-made drones were used by Pakistani forces during India’s counter-terror Operation Sindoor.","The ministry of external affairs spokesperson randhir jaiswal said that new delhi’s approach has not changed.

NEW DELHI: In a decision that could have a salutary bearing on the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Supreme Court on Friday reversed its eyebrow-raising May 2 verdict, directing liquidation of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Limited, to put back in place the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's Feb 2020 decision to allow Sajjan-Jindal-led JSW Steel revive the failed entity.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justices Satish Chandra Sharma and K Vinod Chandran reversed the decision of a two-judge bench led by Justice Bela M Trivedi, since retired, accepting arguments of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Committee of Creditors, and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul for JSW, which invested Rs 20,000 crore to revive BPSL and make it a profit-making company.The two-judge Supreme Court bench had rejected the Committee of Creditors-approved resolution plan of JSW, which was concurrently found to be sound by both National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and NCLAT. Using exclusive powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, SC had directed NCLT to initiate liquidation proceedings of BPSL while deciding an appeal by one of the promoters of BPSL challenging the resolution plan.Writing the 136-page judgment on operation of various IBC provisions, CJI Gavai said, ""The legislature purposefully did not include a means to challenge the commercial wisdom exercised by the CoC.This makes a challenge to the same non-justiciable... Any interference in the paramount objective of the CoC of exercising its commercial wisdom would amount to the court rewriting the law and going against the very objectives of the IBC. "" Referring to takeover of BPSL by JSW, the CJI-led bench said that since the IBC's objective of ensuring corporate debtor continues as a going concern has been achieved and loss-making BPSL has been transformed to a profit-making entity, the clock cannot be put back to penalise JSW by ordering BPSL's liquidation. ""This will defeat the very purpose of IBC to confer sanctity to the finality of duly approved resolution plan,"" SC said.The court rejected the COC's late-in-the-day argument for distribution of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amongst creditors. SC said since the request for resolution plan (RfRP) issued by the resolution professional for the corporate insolvency resolution process did not provide for distribution of EBITDA among creditors, the COC cannot demand it now.SC said sans a specific provision in RfRP regarding distribution of EBITDA, it is impermissible for CoC to raise such a plea five years after approval of the resolution plan.""A successful resolution applicant (JSW in this case) cannot be faced with undecided claims after its resolution plan has been accepted. That would amount to 'hydra heads popping up' which would throw into uncertainty the amounts payable by a prospective resolution applicant who would take over the business of the corporate debtor,"" it said.RBI, in 2017, had issued a circular identifying 12 large-scale corporate defaulters, with outstanding debts valued at Rs 5,000 crore and above, infamously known as the ""dirty dozen"",which included BPSL.","Clock can't be put back to penalise jsw, says supreme court.

NEW DELHI: Hours after bilateral talks with US President , Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday turned into a spokesperson for Donald Trump in his UNGA speech, parroting his claim that the US President played an ""active role"" in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after the military action in May.In his 25-minute speech, Sharif pushed for a Nobel peace prize for Trump, claiming that he is ""a man of peace.""“Though in a position of strength, Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire facilitated by President Trump’s bold and vigorous leadership. We express our deep appreciation to him and his team for their active role in bringing about the ceasefire,"" Shahbaz said.“Who would have lived to tell what happened? And therefore, in recognition of Trump’s wonderful and outstanding contribution to promoting peace in our part of the world, Pakistan nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. I think this is the least we can do for his love of peace — truly, he is a man of peace,” he added.In his speech, Shehbaz also thanked countries including China, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Azerbaijan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and the UN secretary general for extending diplomatic support to Pakistan during its clashes with India.Earlier, Donald Trump met Shehbaz Sharif and army chief Asim Munir in the Oval Office.However, the Pakistani guests were made to wait for more than thirty minutes in the lobby.Speaking to reporters, he said, “We have a great leader coming, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the Field Marshal.

He has highlighted the strategic importance of retaking the Bagram Air Base near Kabul, citing its proximity to China’s nuclear assets.","Pakistan prime minister shehbaz sharif turned into a spokesperson for donald trump in his unga speech.

Poll Do you think multilateral reforms are necessary to address global conflicts? Yes No

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday delivered a pointed message on global conflicts, terrorism and took a veiled swipe at the United States over its stance on Russian oil while stressing the urgency of multilateral reforms.Addressing the G20 Foreign Ministers' meeting, Jaishankar called out the ""double standards"" over buying of Russian energy and said, ""Apart from jeopardising supplies and logistics, access and cost themselves became pressure points on nations. Double standards are clearly in evidence.""As members of the G20, he stressed, nations have a responsibility to “strengthen stability and give it a more positive direction through dialogue and diplomacy, by firmly combating terrorism, and by appreciating the need for stronger energy and economic security.”Speaking on peace and development, Jaishankar highlighted the impact of ongoing conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza, which have exposed the high costs borne by the Global South in terms of energy, food, and fertiliser security.“Apart from jeopardising supplies and logistics, access and cost themselves became pressure points on nations. Double standards are clearly in evidence,” he said, in an unmistakable reference to disparities in how global powers respond to crises.The minister stressed that while peace enables development, threatening development cannot facilitate peace. He warned that making energy and other essentials more uncertain in fragile economies benefits no one and urged nations to move toward dialogue and diplomacy rather than further complicating matters.Jaishankar also pointed out that in any conflict, a handful of countries capable of engaging both sides can play a critical role in achieving and maintaining peace. “Even as we attempt to address complex threats to peace, the value of encouraging a buy-in from those supportive of such goals should be appreciated,” he added.","S jaishankar delivered a pointed message on global conflicts, terrorism and took a veiled swipe at the united states over its stance on russian oil.

Yunus calls reports of rising Islamic fundamentalism in B'desh 'fake news'
