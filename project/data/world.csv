'Where Were Your Ancestors?' Gogoi Mocks BJP, Blasts Modi's Nehru Remark During Vande Mataram Debate

On Gaurav Gogoi and national security

Vision for Assam’s growth

Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday that he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi during his time in Congress party Speaking to NDTV, Sarma, who spent 22 years in the Congress before joining the BJP , said ""Rahul doesn't want Priyanka in Kerala. I was in Congress for 22 years. I also have some inner information. He doesn't want to disturb KC Venugopal and his axis, and Priyanka is an outsider to that axis. That's why he transferred her to Assam. An MP from Kerala has not been assigned responsibility in Kerala. How else do you interpret this?"" he added.Taking a swipe at the Gandhi family, Biswa called them the ""world's biggest flop family"" and added, ""I think my family is better than theirs. We grew up struggling.""The CM denied any personal rivalry with Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi, saying it was his duty to alert the central government about links to what he called an ""enemy country"". He reiterated accusations against Gogoi and his wife of having connections with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI.""But when the link is to an enemy country, and I do not forward it to the Government of India, then as a chief minister, I will be doing a disservice to the Constitution and people. Pakistan is an enemy country and a hostile neighbour. Links with Pakistan cannot be compared with a corruption charge,"" Sarma said. Quoting the Hindi spy thriller Dhurandhar, he added, “If you catch a spy, will you not expose him?”Sarma also voiced apprehensions over changing relations with Bangladesh, crediting former PM Sheikh Hasina’s regime for assisting Assam in tackling extremism.He warned that any hostility from Dhaka could allow militants to establish a base across the 800 km border.On economic matters, Sarma outlined his vision to transform Assam beyond hydrocarbon industries, eyeing opportunities in the semiconductor sector. ""India is a diverse country. We must take care of every state. If one part becomes developed only to cater to the global ecosystem, and there's nothing on the other side, then the country will collapse,"" he said. He described Assam as “landlocked and tucked away near the border” but “one of the fastest-growing big states”.Touching upon identity and demographic concerns ahead of state elections, he said, ""In Assam, we need development. For us, national security and the identity of the Assamese people are paramount. The demographic change is a huge concern. We are fighting for both our identity and development.""Sarma also took a dig at West Bengal, claiming Assam remains a relatively peaceful state, “with no fear of stones being thrown.”","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma said he was a ""victim"" of an alleged rift between rahul and priyanka gandhi during his time in congress party.

You’re 'not addicted' to screen: What is doomscrolling and why it feels impossible to stop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/youre-not-addicted-to-screen-what-is-doomscrolling-and-why-it-feels-impossible-to-stop/articleshow/127096913.cms,"Late-night scrolling through distressing news, known as doomscrolling, is a stress response, not a lack of discipline. Our brains, wired for survival, interpret constant negative information as a threat, leading to anxiety and sleep issues. Understanding this helps shift focus from self-blame to managing stress and practicing digital hygiene for peace

The impact of increased usage of social media

You are doomscrolling

News about violence, war, disasters, and crime

Political conflict and outrage

Social media arguments and abuse

Videos that trigger fear, anger, or helplessness

Endless updates that never seem to end

.

The survival instincts

Why it feels compulsive

Why has this become worse recently

.

Why saying 'just stop' doesn't work

The emotional cost

Understanding changes everything

.

Doomscrolling is a signal, not failure

It’s late at night. The house is quiet. You are tired but not sleepy. Your phone is already in your hand. You tell yourself you will just check one thing. One headline. One update.Thirty minutes pass. Then an hour.You feel worse than before. Your chest feels tight. Your mind is racing. You are angry, anxious, or numb. You put the phone down, but sleep still does not come easily.The next morning, you blame yourself.“I need better discipline.”“I should stop this habit.”“I am addicted.”Doomscrolling is the act of repeatedly consuming negative or distressing news online, even when it begins to affect your mood and mental state. It usually happens without planning. You open your phone to check one update, and then keep scrolling through bad news, angry posts, or frightening information long after it stops being useful.It usually includes:People often describe it as “mindless scrolling”. But it is not mindless at all. Your mind is actually very alert. Too alert. Doomscrolling happens when your brain believes there is danger and feels the need to stay informed to survive it.That is not laziness. That is not a lack of control. That is stress.When humans feel unsafe, the brain shifts into survival mode. This is not new. Long before phones existed, our brains were wired to scan the environment for threats, pay more attention to bad news than good, and remember danger more clearly than safety. This is how humans survived for thousands of years. When there was a threat nearby, knowing more meant staying alive.Today, the “threat” is no longer a wild animal or a nearby enemy. It is a constant stream of information telling us the world is unsafe. The brain cannot tell the difference between a real danger in front of you and repeated stories of danger on a screen. So it keeps scanning, keeps scrolling, and keeps looking for answers that never come.According to Medical News Today, a 2023 study found that people who already feel anxious about the future are more likely to engage in doomscrolling. A separate study published in 2024 suggested that the modern news media’s strong focus on negative events may fuel doomscrolling and deepen people’s existential worries.Doomscrolling often happens at night. That is when distractions are gone, the mind finally slows down, unprocessed stress surfaces, and phones become an easy way to avoid sitting with difficult thoughts.The brain chooses: “Let me focus on this external crisis instead of my own anxiety.” But this keeps the nervous system active when it needs rest. That is why sleep feels harder after scrolling, not easier.People often say, “I don’t even enjoy it. I don’t know why I keep scrolling.” That confusion comes from misunderstanding what is happening. Doomscrolling is not about pleasure. It is about control.When things feel uncertain, the brain wants more information to reduce that uncertainty. It believes that if it knows more, it can prepare.But modern news and social media do not offer closure. They offer endless updates. There is no clear ending.No final answer. No moment where the brain feels safe enough to stop.So the scrolling continues.Not because you want to.Because your brain thinks it has to.Doomscrolling existed before smartphones. People always worried about the news. But it became far more intense because of three things:24/7 news cycles: There is no pause anymore. No morning paper, no evening bulletin. Bad news updates arrive at all hours.Social media algorithms:Platforms push content that triggers strong emotions. Fear and anger keep people engaged longer.Global uncertainty: Pandemics, wars, economic stress, climate anxiety, political instability. Many people feel the future is unpredictable.The phenomenon of doomscrolling named one of the Oxford English Dictionary’s words of the year in 2020 became widely recognised during the pandemic, when disrupted daily routines drove people to constantly check updates on Covid 19 cases and deaths.When stress becomes constant, the brain stays in survival mode for longer. Doomscrolling is one result of that.If doomscrolling were just a habit, simple advice would work. “Put your phone away”, “Have self-control"", “Do a digital detox”. But most people have tried these things. They may work for a day. Or a week. Then the scrolling returns.That is because stress responses cannot be switched off with willpower alone. Telling someone under stress to “just stop” is like telling someone anxious to “just calm down”. It sounds logical. It feels dismissive. And it often increases shame. Shame makes stress worse. And stress fuels doomscrolling.According to Psychology Today, young adults often find it especially hard to put their phones down. This is partly because the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with impulse control and decision-making, is still developing during this stage of life. As a result, breaking cycles like doomscrolling becomes more difficult.Dr. Manoj Kumar Sharma, a clinical psychologist and coordinator of NIMHANS' SHUT Clinic, co-authored studies that observed that during Covid‑19, compulsive “doomsurfing” and “doomscrolling,” driven by cognitive biases and poor mood regulation, led to anxiety, sleep problems, low motivation, and distress, highlighting the need for digital hygiene and offline coping strategies.Doomscrolling slowly changes how you feel about the world and yourself. People report feeling constantly on edge, angry at strangers, emotionally exhausted, hopeless about the future, guilty for not “doing enough” or numb to real joy.This happens because the brain is not designed to process suffering at a global scale every day. Seeing pain without the ability to act creates helplessness. Helplessness is deeply stressful. Over time, the nervous system stays activated even when there is no immediate danger.Doomscrolling is also often a sign of care. This part is important. Many people who doomscroll care deeply. They care about injustice, they care about others. Their scrolling is not apathy. It is concern without an outlet. But caring without boundaries becomes emotional overload. And the brain responds by staying alert instead of resting.Mayo Clinic Press talks about checking your mood while scrolling, setting time limits, and using reminders to manage screen time.When you understand that doomscrolling is a stress response, your relationship with it changes. You stop asking:“What is wrong with me?” And start asking: “What am I reacting to?” This shift matters. Because you cannot heal what you keep blaming.The first step is not cutting down screen time. The first step is recognising stress. Ask yourself: What am I worried about right now? What feels uncertain in my life? What am I trying to prepare for? You may not have clear answers. That is okay. The goal is not solutions. It is awareness. When the brain feels seen, it does not need to shout as loudly.Instead of forcing control, support regulation.Your scrolling is telling you something. It is saying: “I am overwhelmed.” “I am trying to understand.”“I do not feel safe enough to rest.” Listen to that message instead of fighting it.The goal is not to become uninformed. It is to become regulated. You can care without drowning. You can stay aware without staying anxious.If you are doomscrolling, you are not broken. You are responding to a world that feels heavy. Your brain is doing what it was designed to do — protect you. But protection should not come at the cost of peace.Be gentle with yourself. Lower the noise where you can. Rest is not ignorance. It is survival too. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is put the phone down and choose to breathe.","Late-night scrolling through distressing news is a stress response, not a lack of discipline.

Prosperity without responsibility is unsustainable. The RNI seeks to encourage ethical governance, humane development and global stewardship,"" he said.","Singapore ranked first and india 16th in the responsible nations' index (rni) launched by former president ram nath kovind.

India Pushes Urgent Security Council Reform At UN, Says Status Quo Is Fueling Conflict And Misery

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday and reviewed progress in the India-Brazil strategic partnership, while also underlining the significance of bilateral cooperation for the Global South. Modi also told Lula - who, in the middle of a tariff spat with the US last year, had said that he was going to visit India in early 2026 -- that he was looking forward to welcoming him soon.Lula, who dialled Modi, will visit India from Feb 19 to 21. He is also expected to take part in the AI summit during his visit.In the 45-minute conversation, the leaders pledged to work together for UNSC reforms and reaffirmed their commitment to peace in Gaza and to multilateralism.""Glad to speak with President Lula.

NEW DELHI: Members of terrorist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) trespassed and vandalised Indian embassy in Zagreb and tried to replace the Tricolour with a ""Khalistan flag"", drawing strong condemnation from Indian govt.Govt on Thursday said it had raised the issue with Croatian authorities both here and in the Croatian capital and asked them to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""We condemn the incident of trespassing and vandalism at our embassy in Zagreb, Croatia, by anti-India elements,"" said MEA in a statement, adding under Vienna Convention, diplomatic premises are inviolable and must be protected.It said such actions also speak of the character and motives of those behind them, and law enforcement authorities everywhere would do well to take note of them.

They also raised anti-India slogans. This was one of the few occasions where the separatists targeted an Indian mission outside of the ""five eyes countries"" - US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand - where they are mostly based.India has been looking to ramp up its ties with Croatia, a member of EU, and PM Modi had visited the country last year on his way back to India from G7 summit in Canada.In a statement, SFJ claimed the act was timed to coincide with the lead-up to Republic Day.

Bihar Assembly Poll Results: NDA Touches 200-Seat Lead, Congress Intensifies SIR, Vote Chori Attacks

Is Bihar really a win for women?

14% represent the 50%

The fight for a seat in the Parliament...goes on and on and on

Like 'Pradhaan-patis', will reservation Act lead to 'MP-patis'?

Around the world, story not very rosy

Women in Politics: 2025

Are men still writing laws?

The Bihar Assembly elections were widely celebrated as a democratic milestone. With an overall voter turnout of 66.91%, the highest since 1951, and women turning out in unprecedented numbers, the state appeared to signal a quiet transformation.Female voter turnout stood at an impressive 71.6%, far surpassing male turnout at 62.8%. On the surface, this looked like a clear victory for women’s political participation. But a closer look at who actually wields power in Bihar raises uncomfortable questions about whether this enthusiasm translated into real political gains.Despite women driving the electoral surge, representation in the Assembly remains limited. Of the 243 elected MLAs, only 29 are women, just under 12%. This mirrors a long-standing pattern: women show up decisively at the ballot box but struggle to cross the gatekeeping barriers of party nominations and electoral success.The picture becomes even starker in the executive. The Nitish Kumar cabinet has only three women ministers out of 27, amounting to just 11%. In effect, women voters powered a historic election, but men continue to dominate the institutions that shape policy and governance.The candidate landscape explains part of this imbalance. According to ADR data, only 254 women, around 10% of all candidates, contested the 2025 Bihar elections, compared to 2,344 men. This figure has barely changed from the 2020 elections, where women also made up just 10% of candidates. Structural exclusion at the nomination stage ensures that even high voter turnout cannot significantly alter outcomes. Representation of the third gender remains almost nonexistent, with only two candidates contesting.""Once the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam is implemented, parties will have to give tickets to women. That is how women’s representation has increased in other countries,"" said Zoya Hasan, Professor Emerita, Jawaharlal Nehru University.Equally troubling is the quality of political choices on offer. Ninety-four candidates declared cases related to crimes against women, including five accused of rape. That such candidates continue to secure tickets highlights the disconnect between women’s electoral participation and the political system’s responsiveness to women’s safety and dignity.The parliamentary numbers reveal the scale of democratic under-representation women continue to face. While women constitute nearly half the population, they occupy only about 14% of seats in the Lok Sabha. The journey has been one of slow and incremental change. In 1957, women made up just 3% of candidates contesting general elections; by 2024, that figure had risen to 10%. Electoral success has improved, but modestly. From 22 women in the First Lok Sabha and 27 in the Second, the number increased to 78 in the 17th Lok Sabha and stands at 75 in the 18th—still a fraction of proportional representation.The Rajya Sabha shows a similar pattern. Women members increased from 15 in 1952 to 42 today, accounting for around 17% of the Upper House. These gains, while notable, underline how access to Parliament remains structurally limited for women, especially when compared to their electoral participation and demographic weight.In 2023, India took a significant legislative step toward addressing gender imbalance in politics with the passage of the Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act, popularly known as the. The law mandates the rotational reservation of one-third of seats for women in the Lok Sabha and all State Legislative Assemblies, including that of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Framed as a historic corrective to decades of underrepresentation, the amendment seeks to institutionalise women’s presence in legislative decision-making across the federal structure.However, the reform’s impact remains deferred. The legislation is scheduled to come into force only after the publication of the next national census, the timing of which is yet to be announced. Once implemented, the reservation will remain in effect for 15 years. Notably, the amendment excludes the Rajya Sabha, India’s upper house of Parliament, where women currently account for just 13% of members, underscoring the partial nature of the intervention.At the time the bill was passed, women constituted around 14% of the Lok Sabha, the highest proportion since Independence but still well below global benchmarks. According to a United Nations report, the global average for women’s representation in national parliaments stood at 26.5%, while Central and Southern Asia averaged 19%, highlighting India’s lag despite incremental gains.""Panchayats operate at a different level of governance altogether; the logic that has enabled proxy representation or Pradhan-Patis there cannot be transposed to higher legislatures,"" Hasan said.Hasan further noted that the ""political arena"" in which the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha function is ""fundamentally different, leaving little scope for phenomena such as 'MP-patis.'""India has about 14.5 lakh elected women representatives in Panchayati Raj Institutions, forming nearly 46% of all local representatives, an achievement unmatched globally. Twenty-one states have gone further, reserving 50% of PRI seats for women, exceeding the constitutional minimum of 33%. Yet this grassroots success has not translated upward, reinforcing a paradox at the heart of Indian democracy: women lead locally but remain marginal nationally.Recent global assessments suggest that progress has not only stalled but slightly reversed. The Global Gender Gap Report 2025 ranks India 131st, with an overall gender parity score of 64.4%, a drop of three places from the previous year. Political empowerment remains a key area of concern.Female representation in Parliament declined from 14.7% to 13.8% in 2025, while the share of women in ministerial positions fell from 6.5% to 5.6%—continuing a downward trend from the 2019 peak. Against this backdrop, the women’s reservation law represents both a long-awaited promise and a test of political will, with its eventual implementation likely to shape India’s gender parity trajectory in the years ahead.Despite decades of advocacy and incremental reform, women remain significantly underrepresented in political power structures across the world.Themap, released by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, offers a snapshot of the global gender gap in political leadership as of January 1, 2025, underscoring how male dominance in decision-making continues to slow progress toward political equality.According to the data, women serve as heads of state or government in just 25 countries, reflecting the narrow reach of female leadership at the highest executive levels. In national legislatures, women account for 27.2 per cent of MPs worldwide—an improvement over previous decades, but still far from parity. The imbalance is even more pronounced within executive branches: globally, fewer than one in four cabinet ministers are women, with women holding only 22.9% of such positions.The distribution of power within cabinets further highlights structural inequities. While women are more likely to be assigned portfolios related to human rights, gender equality, and social protection, men overwhelmingly control ministries that shape national security and economic direction, including foreign affairs, finance, home affairs, and defence. This gendered division of political labour reinforces longstanding hierarchies, limiting women’s influence over core policy domains.Findings from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and UN Women, released in early 2025, showed that men continued to dominate political leadership worldwide, despite three decades having passed since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action laid out a global roadmap for women’s rights.At the start of 2025, men outnumbered women by more than three to one across executive and legislative positions. Women’s representation in national parliaments had inched up only marginally, reaching just over a quarter of all lawmakers globally. In contrast, women’s presence in government roles moved in the opposite direction, reflecting how gains in legislatures have not consistently translated into executive power.Female political leadership at the highest level remained the exception rather than the norm. Only a small number of countries were led by women, with Europe accounting for the largest share. While 2024 marked several historic firsts, more than half the world’s countries had still never had a woman head of state or government.Hasan pointed out that one of the reasons behind rise in female representation in politics in Europe and the States, has been their increased representation in decision-making roles within political parties.""In Europe and the United States, efforts to increase women’s representation in legislatures have followed a two-pronged approach. One strategy has focused on enhancing women’s presence in decision-making roles within political parties, which in turn has contributed to a rise in the number of women parliamentarians,"" the JNU professor noted.Cabinet-level representation offered a similarly mixed picture. Fewer than one in four cabinet ministers globally were women, and the number of countries with gender-equal cabinets had declined compared to the previous year. Regional disparities were stark, with Europe and the Americas showing higher levels of representation, while large parts of Asia, Central Asia and the Pacific continued to record very low participation by women in executive leadership.","Women voters powered a historic election, but men continue to dominate the institutions that shape policy and governance.

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar Wednesday utilised the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) 2026 - which got underway in Delhi with the participation of delegates from 70 nations - as a forum to showcase the successful conduct of special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar, citing the zero appeals received after publication of the final electoral roll and the subsequent assembly election that witnessed no repolls.""Pure electoral roll, including each and every eligible elector as per law, is essential to strengthen democracy and all elections which will be held on the basis of that electoral roll. The second segment is conduct of polls, which becomes a very challenging, logistical affair, because a large number of people have to obey and follow the electoral laws and the instructions issued by EC,"" Kumar said while highlighting how Bihar election had delivered on both the fronts.Stating that the purpose of IICDEM 2026 is to not only celebrate democracy but also understand the future path, challenges, the expectations of electors and how to make the electoral process smoother and more transparent, free and fair, the CEC explained to the foreign delegates, who included top representatives of 42 electoral management bodies and 27 ambassadors/high commissioners, how Indian elections have become one of the largest exercises on the planet in terms of logistics, numbers and transparency needs.""More than a billion voters, (with) 640 million exercising their franchise at more than a million polling stations....and roughly 2 crore people involved in the exercise is a feat,"" Kumar underlined.Election commissioner S S Sandhu described the faith placed by citizens in electoral management bodies (EMBs) as precious, saying that it is the collective responsibility of EMBs to preserve it.Election commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICDEM-2026 brings together EMBs, researchers, students and practitioners, who view elections from different angles, to brainstorm on all issues relating to democracy & electoral management.Earlier, secretary general of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) Kevin Casas-Zamora welcomed India's chairship of International IDEA, saying that India must share with the world how it has dealt with challenges to build a legacy of ""free and fair elections, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, secularism, press freedom and all the things that constitute a democracy"".Recalling how recent elections across many countries had witnessed political polarisation, illicit funding flows, online and offline aggression and digital misinformation, Casas-Zamora also raised concerns over outright election denialism, with politicians from the US, Peru, Georgia and Bangladesh ""using spurious arguments to question credible results"". He said that 2024 saw 1.6 billion people casting ballots in 74 national elections, including India. ""Yet, global electoral turnout that year was down nearly 10 percentage points compared to 15 years before, while around 40% of elections suffered some form of dispute over their credibility,"" he pointed out.At the same time, he said, elections had helped reverse democratic backsliding in Poland, Senegal, Guatemala and Brazil. ""Democracy can be restored as long as electoral routes for political change remain open,"" he emphasised.Speaking on the theme of IICDEM-2026 - democracy for an inclusive, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world - DG IIIDEM Rakesh Verma said that it reflects a broad and multi-dimensional understanding of what democracy must deliver in the 21st century.","Democracy took roots in india in 600 bc, long before the world: cec gyanesh kumar.

NEW DELHI: India and Spain condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and emphasised the need for strengthening international cooperation to combat terrorism, as external affairs minister S Jaishankar hosted his Spanish counterpart José Manuel Albares for a bilateral meeting on Wednesday.For the second time this week, Jaishankar told a visiting European foreign minister the world must display zero tolerance towards terrorism.

It is more imperative than ever before for nations to collaborate on shared challenges. This is particularly the case with respect to combating terrorism where both India and Spain have been victims. The world must display zero tolerance towards terrorism,” said Jaishankar in his opening remarks in the meeting with Albares.According to the MEA, the ministers reviewed the entire gamut of India-Spain relationship, including trade and investment, defence and security, culture, tourism and people-to-people ties. “The ministers discussed recent developments in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, and exchanged views on other issues of shared interest,” said the govt, as Albares handed over to Jaishankar a declaration of Spain’s accession to India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.

'Bibi, Stop Taking Credit': Trump Humiliates Israeli PM At Davos; Calls Out Israeli Iron Dome 'Lie'

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue, adding that the figure is expected to be “much more than that” next year.Trump made the remarks while addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, where he also highlighted what he described as an unprecedented surge in investments flowing into the country.Linking the rise in investment to the November 5 election outcome, Trump said it had brought clarity about his administration’s tariff policy. “We're doing numbers in terms of people investing in the United States as we've never had before,” he said, adding that tariffs were aimed at protecting the country, which he claimed had been taken advantage of for years.Trump noted that the estimated $600 billion in tariff revenue does not include investments by countries and companies setting up operations in the US. “We'll have, I'd say, $600 billion worth of tariff money coming in. And I think we're going to have maybe more than that. By next year, it'll be much more than that,” he said.Highlighting corporate investments, Trump said Apple is spending $650 billion in the US, calling it a major commitment, and added that Toyota has also announced plans to invest in the country, according to news agency ANI.Recalling a meeting in Japan, he said Toyota’s leadership had confirmed the investment plans as part of a broader trend of global companies expanding their US footprint.Calling the developments “amazing,” Trump said, “We've never had anything like it or close,” adding that no other country was witnessing similar investment momentum.He claimed that from an investment perspective, people were in “great shape” and many investors were making substantial money.In Davos, Trump also waived tariffs planned on European allies following what he described as a framework deal over Greenland, though no details of the agreement were disclosed.",Us president donald trump on thursday said the united states is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue next year.

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side.

This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal.

Visa stamping delay+ prudential revocation of visas





The H-1B stamping delay that began in December continues till now, as no new interview slots opened and now interview dates are being deferred to 2027. Immigration experts said there is no hope for the situation to get better, and the only thing that H-1B visa holders in the US can do is to not travel to India for visa stamping as dates are only getting delayed. Hundreds of H-1B visa holders got stuck in India last December after they traveled to India to get their visa stamping as scheduled in December, only to be told that their interview dates had been deferred to 2026 as the visa officers started social media vetting.Those who had their interview dates in January, February also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India. ""They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,"" Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses. Prudential visa revocation is a cancelation of the visa by the administration based on new information that suggests that the visa holder might be ineligible for the visa. Immigration experts said they are noticing an emerging pattern where the H-4 spouse of an H-1B visa holder is visiting the consulate for stamping only to be told that their visa has been revoked because of some old DUI of the H-1B spouse.","The h-1b stamping delay that began in december continues till now, as no new interview slots opened and now interview dates are being deferred to 2027.

It was marketed as an all-female crew spaceflight, a milestone in commercial space tourism, which was also meant to encourage the feminist movement. The craft reached the boundary of space, and passengers experienced weightlessness for a brief time before returning to Earth.","Katy perry flew aboard a blue origin new shepard rocket on a sub-orbital flight lasting about 11 minutes.

Why the EU withdrew GSP benefits

India’s exports to the European Union is facing higher import tariffs from January 1, 2026, after the EU suspended Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) benefits for 87% of Indian goods, according to a report by trade policy think tank, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).The move means that a large share of Indian exports will now be charged full Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs, ending years of preferential access under the EU’s unilateral trade arrangement for developing countries.Under the GSP framework, Indian exporters benefited from a margin of preference (MoP) — a reduction on MFN tariffs — which averaged around 20% for most textiles, garments and industrial products. With the suspension now in effect, that preference has ended.For example, an apparel item that attracted a 12% MFN tariff but paid only 9.6% under GSP will now be subject to the full 12% duty, directly impacting exporter margins.GTRI said this change is particularly significant for price-sensitive sectors such as garments, where even small tariff increases can influence sourcing decisions and push EU buyers towards duty-free suppliers such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.The suspension applies to nearly all major industrial categories that form the backbone of India’s exports to Europe. These include minerals, chemicals, plastics and rubber, textiles and garments, stone and ceramics, precious metals, iron and steel, base metals, machinery, electrical goods and transport equipment.GSP preferences will now remain available only for a limited set of products — agriculture and food, leather goods, wood and paper, footwear, optical and medical instruments, and handicrafts — together accounting for less than 13% of India’s exports to the EU.While negotiations on the India–EU Free Trade Agreement are close to conclusion, the agreement is expected to take at least a year to come into force. Until then, exporters will have to operate under full MFN tariffs, raising costs and squeezing margins.The timing adds to near-term challenges, as exporters adjust to higher duties amid already fragile global trade conditions.The impact of GSP withdrawal coincides with the start of the tax phase of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from January 1, 2026.Indian steel and aluminium exporters are facing rising carbon reporting and compliance requirements, along with the risk of being charged default emissions values, increasing non-tariff costs. GTRI described the combined effect of higher tariffs and CBAM compliance as a double pressure on exporters.The EU’s GSP system allows developing countries to export at reduced tariffs but includes “graduation” rules, under which preferences are withdrawn once exports in a product group cross a threshold for three consecutive years.India has been graduated for the 2026–2028 period under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1909, adopted in September 2025. While the decision follows established EU rules, the report notes that the economic impact is immediate, with most Indian exports losing preferential access at once.With higher tariffs, rising compliance costs and delayed FTA relief, 2026 is shaping up as a particularly testing year for Indian exports to Europe, GTRI said.Ajay Srivastava noted that until the India–EU FTA is implemented, exporters will need to navigate a period of reduced competitiveness, especially in sectors exposed to both tariff and climate-related trade measures.","India’s exports to the european union is facing higher import tariffs from january 1, 2026.
