No commitment to US on tariffs: Govt to Parlimantary panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-commitment-to-us-on-tariffs-govt-to-parlimantary-panel/articleshow/118865487.cms,"US President Donald Trump

US talks could also prove beneficial for us: Commerce secretary

NEW DELHI: Two days after Donald Trump’s claim that India had committed to bring tariffs “way down”, govt on Monday told a parliamentary panel that no commitments on the issue had been made to the US and it has sought time until Sept to address the issue that is being repeatedly flagged by the American president.Appearing before the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal is learnt to have said that India and the US were working towards a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, focusing on long-term trade cooperation instead of merely seeking immediate tariff adjustments.He also sought to allay concerns over tariff actions against India, arguing that New Delhi was engaged with Washington on a trade deal, in sharp contrast to China, Canada and Mexico — where Trump has announced tariff actions, some of which have already kicked in.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM ’s Asaduddin Owaisi , Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs. According to sources, Barthwal responded by suggesting that India may escape reciprocal tariffs for the moment.Some opposition MPs like AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi, Congress’s Deepender Hooda and TMC’s Sagarika Ghosh are learnt to have questioned the commerce secretary on reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has threatened to impose from April 2 against countries with high tariffs.The parliamentary panel, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , had asked commerce secretary and foreign secretary Vikram Misri to appear before it and explain recent developments, including media reports quoting Trump that India had agreed to lower its tariffs.Earlier in the day, Misri presented govt’s view to panel members about reports of constructions on China border and assured lawmakers that the two countries were in constant touch and there was nothing to be concerned about.Trade issues and Trump’s repeated threats of tariff actions are learnt to have dominated the meeting Monday, where Barthwal made it clear that the country’s interests would be safeguarded during talks for trade deal. He said govt could only react after Trump administration had taken some steps, which was not the case so far.The commerce secretary is learnt to have pointed out that the talks could also prove to be beneficial for India. There is a section in govt which believes higher tariffs on countries such as China will open the doors for India in certain sectors in addition to the proposed bilateral agreement helping export of Indian textiles and leather products.Last week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had suggested that Trump’s stance on tariffs and foreign policy could throw up openings for India. Commerce department officials have maintained that India and US can complement each other, given the list of products that each produces.Sources said committee members asked Misri many pointed questions on China and the dam on Brahmaputra river. He informed the panel that there was no agreement between India and China, but there was a water agreement between India and Pakistan. “So, any issue with China can be discussed bilaterally only,” a source quoted Misri as saying. He said China wanted to restore full-fledged relations with India, with direct flights, visa for visitors and deployment of journalists. He said talks were continuing, but expressed concern about allowing visitors and scribes.","Us talks could also prove beneficial for us: commerce secretary sunil barthwal.

With 43% share, UP top exporter

NEW DELHI: Ukraine has displaced India as the world’s largest arms importer in the 2020-24 timeframe, with its imports skyrocketing by nearly 100 times compared to 2015-19 due to its ongoing debilitating war with Russia.India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with China and Pakistan, while Ukraine stood at 8.8%, as per as per latest data on international arms transfers released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.Overall, European arms imports grew by 155%, fueled by fears of Russia’s expansionism after invading Ukraine in Feb 2022 and the prevailing uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy under the new Trump administration.Pakistan’s arms import, incidentally, increased by 61% between 2015-19 and 2020-24. It was placed fifth in the world ranking, with 81% of its weapons coming from China, in yet another indicator of the ever-expanding military collusiveness between India’s two hostile neighbours.There was a small silver lining for India despite its strategically-vulnerable position of being a top arms importer, with SIPRI noting that its imports decreased by 9.3% between 2015-19 and 2020-24, partly due to New Delhi ’s increasing ability to design and produce its own weapons.The figures, however, do not account for deals where deliveries have not yet begun. This includes, for instance, the mega $3.3 billion contract with the US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B `Predator’ drones, along with another $520 million contract with manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility in India, inked last Oct.Russia remains India’s main weapons supplier, accounting for 36% of its arms imports. Russia’s share, however, has steadily declined from 72% in 2010-14 and 55% in 2015-19 because India has increasingly turned to the US, France and Israel. Russian arms exports, in fact, have fallen sharply by 64% in the latest five-year period, with China too relying mainly on its own military-industrial complex.Despite recent declarations from India and Russia that their defence ties remain as robust as ever, SIPR said, “The shift is visible in India’s new and planned orders for major arms, most of which will come from Western suppliers.”France accounts for 33% of India’s imports, with Israel placed third with 13%. India, of course, is getting set to ink two mega deals with France for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines by Mazagon Docks, collectively worth around Euro 10.6 billion (almost Rs 1 lakh crore). India, incidentally, is the biggest arms customer of France, Russia and Israel.The fourth largest military spender after the US, China and Russia, India needs to single-mindedly pursue cutting-edge defence R&D, expand its defence-industrial base and streamline procurement procedures to ensure it gets the biggest bang for its buck.While DRDO, defence PSUs, shipyards and ordnance factories should become much more dynamic instead of wallowing in time and cost overruns, the domestic private sector and foreign armament majors must be further encouraged to enter defence production here in a much bigger way.Not a single “Make in India” project, for instance, has taken off till now under the much-touted strategic partnership model promulgated in May 2017 to boost indigenous defence production through tie-ups with foreign companies for “deep and extensive” technology transfers.","India notched up 8.3% of the global arms imports in 2020-24, driven largely by heightened tensions with china and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Amid the “frontal attack” by US President Donald Trump, RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) Monday asked govt to ensure that interests of farmers and small businesses are protected during negotiations for bilateral trade deals, including with US.In a statement SJM said at the time of setting up World Trade Organisation, developed countries had agreed to allow developing nations to impose higher tariffs in return for including agriculture, services, investment and intellectual property on agenda and described the US as the biggest beneficiary of multilateral system.It advocated bilateral deals over multilateral agreements.“In view of a frontal attack of US on our exports, on an illegitimate argument that India imposes higher tariffs, and likely increase in tariffs by them, once again underlines the importance of Swadeshi.

NEW DELHI: Nearly 300 Indian nationals returned home via Thailand on Monday after being freed from scam centers in Myanmar, as reported by AFP. A crackdown on these illegal online fraud hubs, largely run by Chinese operators, has led to the release of around 7,000 workers from over two dozen countries.Many of the freed individuals, mostly Chinese, remain stranded in poor conditions near the Myanmar-Thai border. Indian officials escorted seven buses carrying 266 men and 17 women—along with three additional buses transporting their luggage—to Thailand’s Mae Sot airport.The government deployed a C-17 transport aircraft to bring them back, with another 257 nationals set to be repatriated the following day.China, which has already repatriated over 2,000 of its citizens, continues efforts to dismantle these scam operations that thrive in Myanmar’s lawless border regions. These centers, part of a billion-dollar industry, exploit foreign workers for online fraud, including romance and investment scams.

Interpol rejection raises eyebrows

You must put it on your bucket list. Away from all the pollution and noise.

Mark Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as the Prime Minister of Canada, had promised to strengthen the damaged relationship with India if given the opportunity, in his run-up to the elections.On Sunday, the governing Liberal Party elected Carney as its leader amidst ongoing trade tensions with the US and an upcoming federal election. He secured an overwhelming victory with 85.9% of votes.During a recent media interaction in Calgary, Alberta, regarding US tariffs, Carney told cpac that he intented to expand trade partnerships with like-minded nations, highlighting India as a key opportunity.Responding to questions from the media in Calgary, Alberta, the 59-year old had said, “What Canada will be looking to do is to diversify our trading relationships with like-minded countries, and there are opportunities to rebuild the relationship with India.”“There needs to be a shared sense of values around that commercial relationship, and if I am Prime Minister, I look forward to the opportunity to build that,” he added.The diplomatic relationship between both nations deteriorated after Trudeau's September 18, 2023 statement in the House of Commons regarding 'credible allegations' connecting Indian agents to Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death in Surrey, British Columbia.Trudeau, who stepped down in January, continues as PM until the swearing-in ceremony.","Mark carney, who replaced justin trudeau as the prime minister of canada, had promised to strengthen the damaged relationship with india if given the opportunity.

AMRITSAR: The coronation of Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargaj as jathedar of Takht Kesgarh Sahib and as officiating jathedar of Akal Takht early Monday was marked by the absence of traditional grandeur, religious rituals , and participation from high-ranking community members.No senior officials from SGPC and SAD, typically present on such occasions, attended the ceremony at Takht Kesgarh Sahib, held quietly at 2.30am.The function at Akal Takht took place discreetly later in the evening.Heads or representatives of Sikh organisations such as jathedars of other Takhts, Nihang organisations, Sikh Sewa Societies, and Singh Sabhas didn’t attend the ceremonies.Former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh expressed his disappointment over the lack of religious rituals, highlighting that the installation of a jathedar is an occasion akin to a Gurpurb and should have been marked with greater respect and celebration.“To what extent Giani Kuldeep will be able to hold authority within the Panth,” he questioned.Panthic Talmel Sangathan, a conglomerate of around 150 Sikh bodies, announced to stage protests in front of homes of executive committee members of SGPC who signed the decision to relieve the two jathedars.However, Sikh intellectual Harjit Singh believes that almost every organisation has always been divided into two or more factions, and the same situation is unfolding here.“Those who are opposing were appointed through the same procedure by SGPC, which was then supported by Shiromani Akali Dal.

NEW DELHI: At a time when privacy violations in the age of internet and AI concerns many, Justice B R Gavai , the next in line to be CJI, on Monday said protection of personal data in the digital age was an integral part of right to privacy, which in turn was part of right to life.Addressing judges and advocates in the Kenyan Supreme Court, he said there was increasing conflict these days between right to free speech and expression, and reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. Justice Gavai is leading a delegation to Kenya that includes Justice Surya Kant.“Courts are increasingly being called upon to balance freedom of speech and expression with the need to curb misinformation and online harassment,” he said.In such a scenario, it was crucial for judiciaries in developing countries like India and Kenya to interpret and define the limits of digital rights , intermediary liability and governmental regulation of online platforms, he said.While hearing the Ranveer Allahbadia case recently, an SC bench led by Justice Kant had asked the Union govt to deliberate and devise the contours of free speech on social media and possible mechanisms to curb vulgarity, obscenity and attempts to belittle traditional norms of societal decency.“Judiciaries around the world will continue to grapple with complex legal questions surrounding privacy, surveillance, AI ethics , and the governance of emerging technologies,” Justice Gavai said.Reflecting on the promising results of technology infusion in the justice delivery system in India through e-Courts project piloted by the SC, he said, “Ensuring that technology serves as an enabler of justice while safeguarding constitutional rights will remain a key challenge in the years ahead.”While proposing closer interaction between judiciaries of the Global South, he said, “India and Kenya can take a lead in forming the Global South Judiciaries Association on Constitutionalism.”Drawing similarities between the two countries, Justice Gavai said, “Both India and Kenya have large populations that face barriers in accessing legal services. Joint initiatives could focus on strengthening legal aid mechanisms , setting up mobile courts in remote areas, increasing pro bono legal work, and leveraging technology to provide online legal aid services. A collaborative approach can ensure that legal aid schemes are efficiently implemented.”","Justice br gavai is leading a delegation to kenya that includes justice surya kant.

‘Living conditions at Myawaddy decent, terrible near border’

A C-17 Indian military plane Monday evacuated 266 men and 17 women stuck at the Thai-Myanmar border for weeks after being rescued from scam call centres in Myanmar’s Myawaddy. A second batch of 240 are expected to be repatriated Tuesday.The evacuees belong to multiple states, including Andhra, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, UP and Bengal. It was not immediately known where the plane landed in India. K Madhukar Reddy, a native of Rangapeta in Telangana’s Karimnagar district, said over the phone Indian embassy officials and Myanmar’s Border Guard Force facilitated the evacuation.According to an AFP report, a group of Indian officials crossed into Myanmar to accompany seven buses taking the freed Indian nationals — as well as three more carrying their luggage — to Mae Sot airport in northwest Thailand. Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down in recent weeks on illegal online fraud operations that have flourished in the country’s lawless borderlands. Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid conditions in temporary holding camps on the Thai-Myanmar border.“We just want to get out of these detention centres and return home,” one of them told TOI.An Indian currently in detention described the conditions. “The accommodation is decent at Myawaddy detention. They have provided well-maintained AC rooms, but the food is inadequate — sometimes we get one meal a day.”He said conditions were much worse at the border. “There are over 500 people there, with no proper toilets or food. They are forced to stay in army camp-like tents. When we arrived, they took away everyone’s mobile phones.”The rescue operation followed a crackdown on fraudulent cybercrime syndicates that lure foreign workers, including Indians, with fake job offers. These networks, often linked to Chinese-run scam operations, operate from compounds such as KK Park in Myanmar, where victims are forced to carry out phishing schemes, investment frauds, and romance scams.In Feb, Myanmar’s military and BGF raided KK Park and freed about 70 Indians, including five women.

US expands warning of deportation to green card holders after arresting foreign student-activist married to American,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-expands-warning-of-deportation-to-green-card-holders-after-arresting-foreign-student-activist-married-to-american/articleshow/118853855.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

The Trump administration on Monday expanded its crackdown on foreign pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli activists in the US to include permanent residents, warning that their green cards will be revoked so they can be deported.Days after a Chinese scholar at UCLA on a student visa was deported for participating in an anti-Israeli protest, the administration broadened the measure to include green card holders, after arresting a Palestinian student-activist at New York's Columbia University who it said led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.Mahmoud Khalil, the student-activist, was initially detained on the assumption that he was on a student visa, but when it was discovered he was actually a green card holder, which allows permanent residency in the US and is a pathway to naturalized citizenship, authorities said even the green card will be revoked.""We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced wrote on X, opening the door for any permanent resident indulging in activities inimical to the US or consorting with outfits the US designates as terrorist organization to be deported.US immigration law allows the government to revoke a permanent resident’s green card and immigration status if they’ve been convicted of certain crimes, including crimes of “moral turpitude.” As of 2024, there are nearly 13 million green card holders in the US, some 10 million of whom are eligible to become US citizens.Khalil, a Syrian national, served as a key negotiator between students and university officials to the end of anti-Israeli demonstrations at Columbia last year, bringing him into the limelight. He was one of the few activists who publicly identified himself at a campus that became the epicenter of anti-Israeli protest following its attacks on Gaza in retribution for Hamas' terrorist attack.“On March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student. Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,"" a Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that ICE and the Department of State are ""committed to enforcing President Trump’s executive orders and to protecting U.S. national security.""Khalil's attorney Amy Greer told ABC News that his wife, who is eight months pregnant and a US citizen, was unable to locate him after his arrest, and alleged that the Trump administration is openly ""repressing student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza.""Khalil's arrest and possible deportation -- which is certain to be challenged in court -- comes days after President Trump canned $400 million in federal funding to Columbia for its purported failure to combat the pro-Palestinian protests, which the administration has characterized as anti-semitic and involved ""persistent harassment of Jewish students.”","Us immigration law allows the government to revoke a permanent resident’s green card and immigration status if they’ve been convicted of certain crimes, including crimes of “moral turpitude” as of 2024, there are nearly 13 million green card holders in the us, some 10 million of whom are eligible to become us citizens.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118853839,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Elon Musk makes a 'big revelation' on people behind Tesla protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musk-makes-a-big-revelation-on-people-behind-tesla-protests/articleshow/118816757.cms,"What Elon Musk wrote in the post

An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.

ActBlue funders include George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

ActBlue is currently under investigation for allowing foreign and illegal donations in criminal violation of campaign finance regulations. This week, 7 ActBlue senior officials resigned, including the associate general counsel.

If you know anything about this, please post in replies. Thanks, Elon.

Why protests against Tesla

Elon Musk has accused billionaires George Soros and Reid Hoffman of funding recent protests at Tesla showrooms. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk stated, “An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.” He further named the funders of the groups that included George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix.This is not the first time Musk has singled out Soros, who is often the subject of unfounded conspiracy theories, or Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic donor.Musk’s post follows a comment he made just a day earlier, where he said, “Something stinks about ActBlue,” in response to a post on X about seven senior ActBlue officials resigning at the end of February. However, Musk did not provide evidence to support his claims, leading to widespread criticism and skepticism online.Musk wrote:Tesla has become a focal point for protesters who are upset with Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency 's (DOGE) push to cut federal government jobs. On Saturday, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, with some chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire,” according to the New York Post.Earlier in the week, around 350 demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, chanting, “Elon Musk has got to go.” Last week, protests erupted at more than 50 Tesla stores across the US, with some demonstrations extending internationally to cities like Barcelona, London, and Lisbon.Many of these protests appear to be coordinated through the Tesla Takedown website , which encourages participants to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” The site lists the Troublemakers and Disruption Project organizations as sponsors—two groups mentioned in Musk’s recent post.","Elon musk has accused george soros and reid hoffman of funding recent protests at tesla showrooms.

Karl-Anthony Towns Responds to Draymond Green’s Controversial Comment

Forget the Real Housewives drama, the NBA 's got its own soap opera, and this week, it's starring Karl-Anthony Towns and Draymond Green. Move over, Khloe Kardashian , there's a new level of ""keeping up"" to be done. It all started with whispers, then escalated to a full-blown social media firestorm, hotter than a summer mixtape drop from Drake. On Friday, Draymond Green, channeling his inner podcast provocateur, went viral after claiming Karl-Anthony Towns was ducking a matchup with Jimmy Butler. Green, seemingly auditioning for a role as a basketball gossip columnist, speculated that Towns’ absence from the Knicks game was a strategic dodge. Cue the internet exploding like a meme after a Super Bowl halftime show.Turns out, reality hit harder than a LeBron dunk. Towns, alongside girlfriend Jordyn Woods , was dealing with a devastating personal loss. Woods revealed the couple's grief, shining a light on the true reason behind Towns’ absence. Green, in a classic ""oops, my bad"" moment, acknowledged his comments were based on pre-existing speculation, but the damage was done.Towns, however, chose the high road, like a zen master in a Jordan jersey. “I choose to approach that with love and not hate,” he said Sunday. ""That’s all I really care about. I hope no one has to go through what I went through and those kids — and what those kids had to go through. Losing a parent is tough.”Returning to the court Friday night against the Clippers, Towns opened up about his grieving process. ""It's been a very tough week,"" he admitted, his voice heavy with emotion. ""Especially, for a week for a place where I'm usually comfortable at in the summer. It meant a lot to have my teammates supporting me and understanding the situation... We were all very close with this woman. For me, it's a little tougher, having to open old wounds up having to be there for her kids that lost their mother, and I know how that is. Two boys that lost their mother, I know the feeling.""In a world where hot takes and viral clips reign supreme, Towns' response served as a poignant reminder that behind the highlight reels and trash talk, there are real people dealing with real pain. Sometimes, even in the NBA, it’s not about the game, it’s about humanity. And sometimes, you just need to take a page from Ted Lasso and choose kindness.","Karl-anthony towns responded to draymond green's comments about him.
