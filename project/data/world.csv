NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday turned a minor translation fumble into a light-hearted exchange and minutes later, used the very same language switch to send a hard-hitting global message on terror with razor-sharp warnings.The light-hearted moment during the joint press conference between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Keir Starmer caught attention when the Prime Minister offered words of comfort to his conterpart's translator, who briefly fumbled while translating English to Hindi.The official translator momentarily hesitated after using an English word mid-sentence. Realising the blend of languages, the translator paused and apologised for switching from Hindi to English during the interpretation.Without missing a beat, PM Modi smiled and reassured her, saying, ""Don’t bother. We can use English words in between. Don’t worry about it."" The remark drew chuckles from the audience and added a casual tone to the otherwise formal diplomatic setting.Meanwhile PM Modi, himself switched to English mid-speech while speaking on terror to deliever a strong message to Khalistani groups and Western countries.""Those who misuse democratic freedoms to undermine democracy itself, must be held to account,"" he said.In the past also PM Modi had switched to English to ensure the world got his message on terror.In a first reaction to deadly Pahalgam terror attack , PM Modi at a rally in Bihar's Madhubani in English said, ""India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers"".While he delivered the rest of the speech in Hindi, this English switch made India's resolve clear to punish those behind the massacre of 26 people in south Kashmir's Pahalgam.A few days later, India avenged the deaths by conducting Operation Sindoor on terror infra in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.","Pm narendra modi offered words of comfort to his conterpart's translator, who briefly fumbled while translating english to hindi.

"Muizzu's U-turn: India in, China out? Maldives seemingly pivots again as PM Modi offers big incentives",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/muizzus-u-turn-india-in-china-out-maldives-seemingly-pivots-again-as-pm-modi-offers-big-incentives/articleshow/122923323.cms,"Strategic U-turn



What could be the reasons behind change in stance?



India's sustained efforts



NEW DELHI: Maldives, which has had a pro-China tilt in the past, seems to be warming up to India with President Mohamed Muizzu praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""wonderful person"".Coming from someone who rose to power on an ""India Out"" campaign, followed by his cabinet colleagues making derogatory remarks against PM Modi, shows a significant shift in the geopolitical dynamics of the Global South.The two leaders held talks on Friday to repair bilateral ties as the also discussions focused on strengthening cooperation in trade, defence, and infrastructure.After coming to power by promising to reduce Indian influence and build closer ties with China—including a first state visit to Beijing and agreements for Chinese military assistance—Muizzu now calls India a ""trusted friend"" and rolled out the red carpet for PM Modi, breaking with protocol to personally receive him at the airport.""He is a wonderful person who is very fond of building relationships between India's neighbours. The Maldives and India have a very good relationship that goes back centuries, and with PM Modi's leadership, cooperation between the two governments is going to be even more prosperous in the days ahead,"" he said on the last day of PM Modi's trip.The Maldivian economy is under severe stress with a substantial budget deficit and dwindling foreign reserves, and the support offered by India is pivotal for Muizzu’s government to stabilize finances.Although Maldives still owes China large debts, New Delhi has emerged as a key partner to avoid potential economic default.During PM Modi's visit, India announced a fresh $ 565 million line of credit (LoC) for the Indian Ocean neighbour and signed an agreement to reduce its annual debt repayment burden by 40%.“To give a new impetus to our development partnership, we have decided to provide a line of credit of $ 565 million, or approximately Rs 5,000 crore, to Maldives. It will be used for projects related to infrastructure development in line with the priorities of the people of Maldives,” PM Modi said, as he hailed Maldives as a ""true friend"".However, this diplomatic shift hasn’t happened overnight, and it certainly can’t be attributed to PM Modi’s visit alone.Amid early concerns about losing a key ally in the region, India chose restraint over rhetoric. New Delhi maintained steady engagement, with PM Modi being the first world leader to congratulate Muizzu after his election victory. This gesture, combined with consistent diplomatic outreach and sustained economic support, laid the groundwork for rebuilding trust.Back in 2019, India had extended an $800 million Line of Credit (LoC) to the Maldives during the tenure of the pro-India Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) government.What PM Modi's trip has done, is to bring India's efforts to light, with Muizzu acknowledging it. ""We all have seen how India has helped the Maldives in the past, and nobody will doubt how India will be a very crucial partner going forward,"" he said.""India is one of the major tourism countries that helps the Maldives with tourism. With PM Modi's visit, it is going to increase a lot. I am sure that people-to-people exchange between the two countries will greatly boost because of this visit,"" he added.Analysts note that Muizzu’s pivot is a pragmatic recognition of Maldives’ geographic and economic realities—India remains indispensable for trade, connectivity, and tourism. While China’s support remains, India’s proximity and willingness to provide urgent financial and developmental assistance have proved decisive in influencing Muizzu’s recalibration","Maldives, which has had a pro-china tilt in the past, seems to be warming up to india. President mohamed muizzu praised prime minister narendra modi as a ""wonderful person"" india announced a fresh $ 565 million line of credit (loc) for the indian ocean neighbour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122923619,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1160894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace, IAF vice chief Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari said on Friday.""We have discussed a lot about the cost-benefit, especially of air power. There is no greater example I think than what we did in Operation Sindoor. Less than 50 weapons can bring the adversary to the talking table...that is an example that needs to be studied and will be studied (by scholars),"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, speaking at an interactive session during an aerospace power seminar here.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, in turn, said the armed forces need to maintain ""very high"" operational readiness round-the-clock and throughout the year because Operation Sindoor ""still continues"", while stressing that ""there are no runners-up in war"".Noting that the rapid advances in technology and the ongoing geopolitical churn have ushered in ""a third revolution in warfare"", the CDS said the Indian military needs ""information warriors, technology warriors and scholar warriors"" geared for multi-domain operations. It is essential for the military to learn both 'shastra' (warfare/weapons) and 'shaastra' (knowledge), he said.Though Air Marshal Tiwari did not specify the weapons that were used during the May 7-10 hostilities, IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structuresThe IAF vice chief also said manned systems like fighters ""still have a huge advantage"" over unmanned systems like drones, in terms of the ""compellence"" and ""coercive diplomacy"" to be imposed on an adversary, and will continue to do so for some time.""We are giving too much importance to unmanned systems. While they have a place and relevance in modern warfare, but the kind of weight of attack, the intelligence required, the kind of damage they can cause...You have to see whether they balance with what manned aerial systems bring to the table,"" he said.Different speakers at the ""Capstone"" seminar organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies and College of Air Warfare stressed the need for India to ""prioritise"" the development of aerospace power, which was ""not escalatory"" but ""a strategic and effective tool for escalation control"" as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor. ""Operation Sindoor underlined the speed, reach and flexibility of airpower. We established escalation dominance over Pakistan,"" said a speaker.Others pointed out that India had drawn a new red line for Pakistan by stressing it will not be dissuaded by the western adversary's nuclear blackmail and continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks in the future as well.",Less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by india at airbases and radar sites in pakistan compelled the western adversary to come to the negotiating table and sue for peace.

Dairy has not been opened, so is ethanol. India has kept itself safe in the areas that are sensitive. No duty concession has been given (in these areas). This FTA carries a very big message for the future economy of India. We will all see the benefits that India will get under it in the coming years,"" he said told the media.Goyal said Indian seafood will be able to compete more favourably with produce from Vietnam and Singapore in the UK market.The minister said that govt managed to lower the duties on automobiles and scotch - areas where talks had been held up for years - but ensured that the volumes were not significant to affect the domestic industry.Similarly, he argued there was no compromise on intellectual property rights. ""We will not allow any evergreening of patents. Yet, we have managed to get a very strong chapter on intellectual property not just in the UK agreement, but also with EFTA countries,"" he said.Switzerland, which is part of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the UK have for long demanded easier rules around patents as both are home to large pharma companies.Citing the recent controversy over Prada launching footwear that was a rip-off of Kolhapuri chappals, Goyal said with the implementation of CETA, India will get the credit for products that enjoy Geographical Indication (GI). ""Someone used the design of our Kolhapuri sandal. Commerce ministry immediately took action on it. In future, when Kolhapuri sandals are exported, India will get the credit. It will be exported as India's GI product,"" he said.While being critical of the review of trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and Asean countries, which were signed by UPA, Goyal said the UK treaty provided for a review every five years, but both countries needed to agree.Separately, the commerce department said the UK treaty safeguards to temporarily raise tariffs or suspend concessions in case of a sudden surge in British imports, which harms domestic industry. The duration of a bilateral safeguard measure under this pact is initially up to two years and can be extended for an additional two years if investigations show that the safeguard measure is needed to prevent serious injury to domestic industry.","India managed to get extensive benefits without making any compromises under the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (ceta) with the uk.

NEW DELHI: The special intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls was ""conducted in a manner that constitutes a grave fraud on voters"", petitioners opposing the Election Commission's exercise told Supreme Court on Saturday, alleging irregularities such as BLOs being found signing enumeration forms themselves, those dead being shown to have filled up forms, and those who hadn't filled up forms getting a message that their forms had been completed.Countering EC's submission that there was no irregularity in the process, Association for Democratic Reforms and Bihar's main opposition party, RJD, said in their responses that EC's figures were of no consequence since most of the forms were collected without documents and a large number of voters continued to be at the risk of disenfranchisement.Enumeration forms are being mass uploaded by BLOs without the knowledge or consent of voters, in order to achieve the unrealistic target set by EC. Many voters have reported that their forms have been submitted online, despite never having met with any BLO or signed any documents. Forms of even dead individuals have been reported to have been submitted,"" Association for Democratic Reforms said in its response filed through advocate Neha Rathi.It said, ""This points to the flawed manner in which the current SIR is being conducted, where the integrity of electoral rolls is compromised, potentially affecting millions of voters and undermining the democratic process.The situation raises serious questions about transparency, accountability and the potential for electoral fraud, as voters express confusion and concern over how their details were uploaded without their involvement. ""RJD MP Manoj Jha, in his response filed by advocate Fauzia Shakil, said media reports pointed out countless instances where electors have complained that BLOs did not visit their house or neighbourhood, forms were not given in duplicate, no acknowledgement was given on submission of forms and photos were not taken. He said BLOs were found forging voters' signatures on forms and uploading them.""The present exercise is unprecedented inasmuch as for the first time a person is being asked to furnish a documentary proof of his citizenship to the satisfaction of Election Commission to be enrolled as a voter and exercise his constitutional right to vote. As is evident from a bare perusal of Form 6 - the application form for a new voter - and documents for proof of date of birth and documents for proof of residence were required to be furnished along with only a declaration that a person is a citizen of India,"" Jha said.Pitting former EC commissioner against the poll panel, the petitioner referred to the opinion of Ashok Lavasa, who also questioned EC's decision on SIR. They also said there was no valid reason for EC to reject SC's suggestion to accept Aadhaar, voter ID and ration cards for inclusion in electoral rolls and that the exercise being done just months before the Bihar assembly polls was creating confusion on the ground and could disenfranchise lakhs of voters.""In light of the media reports from Bihar, showing how BLOs are signing blank enumeration forms in absence of voters, the numbers as suggested by EC are circumspect and even otherwise are of no consequence since most of these forms have been collected without documents and a large number of the electorate in Bihar continues to be at the risk of disenfranchisement. It is submitted that inclusion of name in draft roll has no meaning till documents as required are submitted, and thus, the risk of disenfranchisement looms large over a huge population who has already voted in multiple elections since 2003,"" the response said.","Blos found forging voters' signs: rjd and association for democratic reforms.

Chandrasekaran is learnt to have agreed to these suggestions.""Some departments, like safety, training, maintenance, engineering and 'integrated operation control centre' (IOCC), are key to ensuring overall operations take place safely. There were observations about some of these departments having a dichotomy in terms of someone being the post holder but someone else calling the shots. This needs to be resolved and we are hopeful the same will happen,"" said people in the know.After the June 12 AI 171 crash and subsequent minor incidents, the ministry has been holding high-level discussions with AI management headed by CEO Campbell Wilson. Three days of intense discussions culminated in the Chandrasekaran-Naidu-Sinha-Kidwai meeting on Friday.Following the minor incidents (AI 171 is being probed separately), AI post-holders were called to regulatory agencies concerned multiple times. With knowledge of AI's inside functioning, regulatory officials often ""felt bad"" for the ""scapegoats"" as those really calling the shots were not before them. ""Unko kyan bolein hum (What can we say to them),"" shrugged some officials who face this dilemma.On June 21, the DGCA had ordered the removal of three AI officials in charge of crew scheduling following ""lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements"", while warning it could go to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses in crew scheduling continued.One other thing that has been subtly pointed out to the management by officials following the June 12 crash is the airline's decision to keep items from planes that have crashed in the past (not AI 171) at its mega Gurgaon complex. Things like seats, instruments and flight data recorders have been kept on display. While it was perhaps meant to serve as a reminder of the need for safety, it is intensely disliked by a large number of employees.""We need positive energy and that place brings just negativity. We look at those seats and feel someone might have perished on them,"" said many employees.A senior govt official said: ""With Tatas and Singapore Airlines as its stakeholders, this is the best chance AI has to become the airline of JRD's dreams. Along with IndiGo, India today is looking at the possibility of two big Indian airlines, with some promising newbies that can also make it big some day. Govt will help Indian airlines, and that is what it is doing with AI handholding at this difficult time. Also, safety is govt's responsibility also in a highly regulated sector like aviation. ""All airlines have their own issues, and AI is not alone. ""Our attention on AI as of now is like a teacher paying extra attention to a promising student who might not be doing well for some reason,"" govt officials said, adding, ""It is time the well-run Singapore Airlines helps its JV come out of this huge crisis.""","After the june 12 ai 171 crash and subsequent minor incidents, the ministry has been holding high-level discussions with ai management.

‘Rudra brigades to have all combat elements, to be deployed together’

NEW DELHI: With the collusive military threat from China and Pakistan figuring high on India's radar screens, which was reinforced during Operation Sindoor , the Army is now setting up some new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades and 'Bhairav' light commando battalions for a greater and swifter offensive punch along the borders.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and will also progressively equip all its 400-odd infantry battalions with drone platoons, against the backdrop of drone warfare upending all conventional military tactics in conflicts across the globe.Announcing these steps towards transforming and modernising the Army into ""a future-ready force"" during the Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass on Saturday, General Upendra Dwivedi said India had delivered ""a well-planned, precise, and decisive response"" to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities to ""achieve a decisive victory"".We gave them (Pakistan) a chance for peace but they acted with cowardice. We then answered with only valour...Operation Sindoor is our resolve, our message, and our response,"" General Upendra Dwivedi said, warning Pakistan against misadventures in the future. ""With the unwavering trust of the countrymen and the strategic autonomy granted by the govt, the Army delivered a well-planned, precise, and decisive response.The Army chief's transformation announcements involve conversion of existing units and formations, without fresh troop accretions, a senior officer told TOI. Some of the existing over 250 single-arm brigades (over 3,000 soldiers each) are now being converted to all-arms ones with integration of fighting elements like infantry, mechanised infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, Special Forces and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which will be backed by customised logistics and combat support. The bulk of the existing brigades are from the infantry, with the others being from other arms like the artillery, armoured, mechanised infantry, air defence and the like. At present, these brigades, commanded by one-star officers or brigadiers, come together only during exercises or actual combat.""Now, the ones being converted to Rudra brigades, tailor-made for specific areas and tasks along the borders, will have all combat elements and be permanently deployed together in peace and war. Their re-structuring has been validated and approved. Two Rudra brigades have already been set up,"" the senior officer said.This is in tune with the long-pending proposal to restructure some Army formations into self-contained 'integrated battle groups (IBGs)', with 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units to be commanded by Major-Generals, which is yet to be approved by the govt.The new Bhairav light commando battalions will be in addition to the existing specially-trained and equipped 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) meant for covert warfare deep behind enemy lines.The plan is to raise at least 40-50 Bhairav battalions, drawn from existing infantry units and equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, in phases. Indicating that a few have already been raised, Gen Dwivedi said, ""The agile and lethal special forces Bhairav units are ready to surprise the enemy on the borders.""""Every infantry battalion will have drone platoons, while the firepower of the artillery has been multiplied many times through Divyastra batteries and loiter munitions batteries. The Army Air Defence (AAD) is being equipped with indigenous missile systems,"" he added.The AAD is slated to get two new regiments of the Akash Prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China for Rs 8,160 crore as well as three regiments of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems for Rs 36,000 crore (which includes three squadrons also for IAF), as was reported by TOI earlier.Akash Prime has the capability to intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a 25km range, it is 30km for the highly-mobile QRSAMs. They will add to India's existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.","Army to add more muscle on pakistan, china fronts.

However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","India is expected to participate in the un high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution. 123 countries and agencies, including india, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122927764,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1303847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Thailand-Cambodia border clash: Indian Embassy issues advisory; shares list of places 'not recommended for traveling',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thailand-cambodia-border-clash-indian-embassy-issues-advisory-shares-list-of-places-not-recommended-for-traveling/articleshow/122896889.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Thailand has issued a travel advisory urging Indian nationals to stay updated and avoid certain areas near the Thailand-Cambodia border, as deadly clashes between the two countries continue.In a post on X, the Embassy advised travellers to monitor official Thai sources such as the TAT Newsroom, and referred to a Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) alert listing areas in seven provinces that should be avoided due to the ongoing conflict.The TAT’s advisory, last updated on July 24, warned tourists against visiting several popular sites across Ubon Ratchathani, Surin, Sisaket, Buriram, Sa Kaeo, Chanthaburi and Trat provinces. Among the restricted locations are Phu Chong-Na Yoi National Park, Prasat Ta Muen Thom, and Khao Phra Wihan National Park. Travellers were urged to contact local TAT offices for further updates and assistance.More than 100,000 people have already fled the bloodiest border fighting in over a decade, Thai authorities confirmed. The clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have involved tanks, jet fighters, and artillery, leaving at least 15 people dead 14 civilians and one Thai soldier and injuring 46, including 15 soldiers.Nearly 300 temporary shelters have been set up across four Thai border provinces to house the displaced.Cambodian authorities have not released their own casualty figures, but shelling has been reported in the town of Samraong, just 20 kilometres from the border. “We are scared because they began shooting again at about 6:00 am,” a local man told AFP, as his family fled to a nearby Buddhist temple.Despite calls for calm from Asean Chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hostilities resumed early Friday. The Thai army accused Cambodian forces of launching attacks with BM-21 rocket systems, prompting retaliatory strikes.The fighting stems from a decades-long border dispute, with the current flare-up beginning in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed. Diplomatic tensions worsened Thursday after Thailand expelled Cambodia’s ambassador and Phnom Penh responded by downgrading ties.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata sons chairman n chandrasekaran met union aviation minister ram mohan naidu and aviation secretary samir kumar sinha.

2. What led to Joy Taylor’s departure from Fox Sports?



3. Did Joy Taylor comment directly on Donald Trump?



Just days after her departure from Fox Sports, Joy Taylor stirred public debate by weighing in on reports linking Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein ’s files. Her pointed social media post signaled a bold return to the spotlight, suggesting she’s no longer holding back when it comes to political commentary.On July 24, Joy Taylor reposted a story from Complex on her Instagram Stories revealing that Donald Trump had reportedly been notified by the Justice Department that his name appears in documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender. Alongside the post, Taylor wrote a biting caption: “Water is wet.”The cryptic remark quickly caught fire online, with many interpreting it as a sarcastic confirmation that Trump’s name showing up in such files was unsurprising — or perhaps long suspected. While Taylor didn’t expand on her message, her decision to comment so soon after her Fox Sports departure suggests she’s no longer interested in playing it safe in the public sphere.Joy Taylor’s social media moment arrives amid lingering questions surrounding her firing from FS1, where she co-hosted Speak with Keyshawn Johnson and Paul Pierce. Her name was recently included in a January sexual misconduct and discrimination lawsuit filed by former FS1 hairstylist Noushin Faraji.The suit also named Skip Bayless and former executive Charlie Dixon, accusing Taylor of downplaying a groping allegation and mocking PTSD symptoms.Joy Taylor has denied the accusations outright, calling them “meritless and attention-seeking.” However, internal reviews reportedly uncovered additional concerns behind the scenes. Former FS1 host Cris Carter commented on the matter during a podcast appearance, saying, “They had to tear all those shows down… That thing was ugly… Had to happen.”Meanwhile, the Donald Trump-Epstein connection continues to make headlines. A report from The Wall Street Journal claims that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name had surfaced in DOJ files related to Epstein. The White House has dismissed the reports as “fake news,” insisting that appearing in documents does not imply wrongdoing.Still, Joy Taylor’s post suggests public figures are no longer willing to stay quiet — especially when they feel uncensored.Also Read: Joy Taylor’s FOX Sports scandal: Everything about the backstage drama, show cancellations, and lawsuit that led to her exit She posted a controversial reaction to reports linking Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, sparking political backlash.Joy Taylor was named in a sexual misconduct and discrimination lawsuit, prompting a major shakeup at FS1.Yes, she shared a cryptic post seemingly mocking the resurfaced Epstein allegations involving Trump.",Joy taylor stirred public debate by weighing in on reports linking donald trump to jeffrey epstein.

US president Donald Trump on Friday deflected questions about pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell , the longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein , saying he hasn’t thought about it. Instead, he turned the spotlight towards other high-profile names once linked to Epstein.“You ought to be talking about Bill Clinton! He went to the island 28 times. I never went to the island. I don’t even know what they’re talking about,” Trump told reporters before flying to Scotland.He added, “Focus on the former president of Harvard, some of the hedge fund guys. I’ll give you a list. These guys lived with Jeffrey.”Trump's remarks came as deputy attorney general Todd Blanche was questioning Maxwell for the second day. The justice department is trying to move past three weeks of headlines sparked by attorney general Pam Bondi’s public hints about an alleged Epstein client list.Bondi had earlier suggested she had access to explosive information, but later walked back, stating no such list exists and reaffirming that Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019.Trump, who once had ties with Epstein before a reported falling out in 2004, has found it difficult to convince Republicans and his base to drop the matter.

Kaynan Duarte VS Aaron ""Tex"" Johnson / Pan NoGi Championship 2020

It is safe to say that air travel hasn’t been smooth for MMA fighters lately. Earlier this year, Khabib Nurmagomedov made headlines after being removed from a Fly Frontier flight following a dispute with a flight attendant. Now, another fighter, Aaron “Tex” Johnson, is in the spotlight for a similar incident.Johnson was recently escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight at LaGuardia Airport after a heated outburst. A viral video from the scene shows him shouting at airline staff, calling them “losers” and “pieces of sh*t.” While the exact cause of his meltdown remains unclear, it reportedly stemmed from a baggage-related issue after boarding. It is being said that the BJJ fighter even got into an argument with fellow passengers and threatened to beat them up.The flight staff later spoke with TMZ and told them that the 39-year-old’s behavior was “belligerent and unruly,” which they did not tolerate. Even after being removed from the plane, Johnson continued to cause a scene. He was later seen inside the airport, restrained on a stretcher, claiming he was mistreated by airline staff.He could be seen using more choice words like “bulls*it” and even gave a racial touch to the incident, saying that he was treated like a black person.Port Authority Police escorted him to a local hospital for evaluation and issued a disorderly conduct summons. All of this took place on Monday, while Johnson spoke about it on Friday to one of his followers and confirmed that the chaos took place because of a bag.Aaron Michael Johnson was born on 1 April 1986 in Bedford, Ohio. Due to his father's military service, Johnson moved frequently and lived in various parts of the U.S. His interest in martial arts was sparked early, thanks to his family, and he began training in taekwondo as a child.In high school, after relocating from Texas to Georgia, he joined the football team and quickly earned the nickname “Texas,” which later evolved into “Tex.” He also spent a year competing as a heavyweight wrestler for Douglasville High School in Georgia, further building the foundation for his future in combat sports.Johnson is a well-known name in the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) world. A black belt under Philip Smith and Murilo Santana, Johnson made his mark as a three-time IBJJF Pan American No-Gi Champion, according to BJJ Heroes. His overall BJJ record stands at 87 wins, 70 losses, and one draw.Known for his aggressive, submission-heavy style, Tex has taken down some big names in the sport, including Davi Ramos and Jackson Sousa. BJJ Heroes describes his approach as “aggressive and submission-oriented,” which helped him become one of the top grapplers of his era. Johnson also dipped his toes into MMA, competing for promotions like Bellator.According to Sherdog.com, he concluded his professional career with a record of 13 wins and 10 losses, retiring in 2015 after suffering a unanimous decision loss to Eric Spicely. But Tex’s career hasn’t been without controversy. In 2018, he was reportedly kicked out of his BJJ gym in Charlotte, North Carolina, for training at a rival gym and being “too aggressive during rolling,” a claim acknowledged by Johnson himself.Also read: WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan dies at 71 after reported cardiac arrest","Aaron ""tex"" johnson was escorted off a southwest airlines flight at laguardia airport after a heated outburst.
