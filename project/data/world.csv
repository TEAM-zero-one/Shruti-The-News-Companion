'Failure Of Personalised Diplomacy’: Congress Hits Out At PM Modi Over Russia-Pakistan Arms Deal

NEW DELHI: A political spat broke out over the weekend after Congress , citing a media report, accused Modi government of allowing ally Russia to proceed with supply of advanced RD-93MA engines to Pakistan for its Chinese-made JF-17 fighter jets. The BJP hit back on Sunday, citing another media report that said Moscow had termed the claim false.On Saturday, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had shared on social media a report that alleged Russia had ignored India's objections and moved ahead with the sale of the RD-93MA engines for Pakistan's upgraded JF-17 Thunder Block-III aircraft. Ramesh claimed the new variant of the fighter would use the same PL-15 missiles ""believed to have been used against our country during Operation Sindoor"".Within hours, BJP's IT-cell head Amit Malviya countered the charge, citing another report that said Russia had dismissed the claim. He posted on social media that Ramesh had relied on a media story ""which in turn quoted a little-known website notorious for pushing pro-Pakistan propaganda"".","Bjp hit back on sunday, citing another media report that said moscow had termed the claim false.

India’s Growth And Resilience Unshaken Despite Global Tariff Pressures, Says Nirmala Sitharaman

Poll Have you ever tried to claim any unclaimed money that may belong to you? Yes, successfully No, I haven't thought about it

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Key details have emerged following the investigation of Mohammad Yousuf Katari, 26, who was arrested for his role in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Officials said on Sunday that Katari met the three terrorists behind the attack—Sulieman alias Asif, Jibran, and Hamza Afghani, four times and provided them logistical support, including an Android phone charger, which became a key piece of evidence leading to his capture, reported PTI.Katari, a resident of South Kashmir’s Kulgam district, reportedly told investigators that he had met the attackers in the Zabarwan hills outside Srinagar. He had also guided them through the difficult terrain.His arrest followed weeks of investigation, including forensic analysis of items recovered during Operation Mahadev in July, which killed the three terrorists linked to the Pahalgam massacre. Security agencies tracked the partially destroyed phone charger to Katari, confirming his connection to the attackers.Authorities indicated that Katari’s interrogation may uncover further links in the terror support network in the Kashmir Valley. The case could be transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is already probing the broader conspiracy behind the Pahalgam attack.The NIA has arrested two individuals so far in connection with the April 22 terror attack for allegedly offering logistical support and shelter to the terrorists.The April 22 attack in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot often called “mini Switzerland,” marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since the 2019 Pulwama attack. TRF, a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), had claimed responsibility.","Mohammad yousuf katari, 26, was arrested for his role in the april 22 pahalgam terror attack.

Courts had objected to royal honorifics earlier also

JAIPUR: Princely states are long gone, but the ‘Maharaj’ has lingered.Now, Rajasthan high court has drawn a line.Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal directed descendants of the former Jaipur royal family to drop the prefixes “Maharaj” and “Princess” from their ongoing petitions or see their 24-year-old case dismissed. The court set Oct 13 as the final deadline.One week’s time is granted to the petitioners to file a correct amended cause title deleting the prefix Maharaj and Princess from the names of the petitioners and respondent, Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal said on Friday.Failure to comply, the court warned, would mean automatic dismissal “without reference to the court”.The directive came while hearing petitions filed in 2001 by legal heirs of late Jagat Singh and Prithviraj Singh, descendants of the erstwhile Jaipur royal family, challenging the collection of house tax by municipal authorities.The judge questioned the relevance of royal honorifics in today’s republic, pointing out that princely privileges were abolished decades ago. The court asked bluntly why such titles should continue to appear in legal proceedings.In Jan 2022, the Jaipur bench raised similar objections in a related case, seeking responses from both the Union and Rajasthan governments over the continued use of royal designations. Earlier, Jodhpur principal seat of the high court had also flagged the same concern in multiple petitions.",Rajasthan high court has directed descendants of former jaipur royal family to drop the prefixes “maharaj” and “princess” from their ongoing petitions.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is going for emergency acquisition of six mobile AK-630 multi-barrel air defence gun systems, in what is another step towards protecting population centres from hostile drones, loiter munitions, rockets and mortars along the border with Pakistan.The procurement tender for the 30mm gun systems, which have an effective range of 4-6 km, has been issued to defence PSU Advance Weapon and Equipment India Ltd (AWEIL). ""The contract will be inked under the fast-track emergency procurement mechanism approved after Operation Sindoor. More such guns, which act as close-in weapon systems because of their high rate of fire, will be ordered at a later stage,"" an officer said on Saturday.The AK-630 gun systems are mounted on trailers and towed by high-mobility vehicles, which offer flexibility and rapid deployment. The gun system is capable of a cyclic rate of fire up to 3,000 rounds per minute, which creates a wall of air defence shells to destroy approaching hostile aerial objects at close ranges.""It has an all-weather fire control system for target detection and engagement during day and night as well as adverse weather conditions.

Transnational organised crime is a concern for India & Canada, says govt

NEW DELHI: While Canadian police focus on tackling the Bishnoi syndicate, pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week. The theatre has stopped screening Hindi movies since. The attacks were carried out on Oct 2 and Sept 25. In the second incident, the suspects fired gunshots to cause a scare.Designated terror group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) released a statement on Friday calling on the Carney govt to ban all “Made In India” films.In the first incident, two masked suspects wearing black clothing attempted to ignite a fire at the theatre’s entrance using flammable liquid from red gas cans, CCTV footage released by Khalistani elements shows. The fire was contained outside, causing moderate damage. This happened at 5.30am on Sept 25.On Oct 2, around 1.50am, a single suspect, described by local police as a heavy-built male wearing black and a face mask, fired multiple shots at the theatre’s entrance doors.Halton Regional Police said they were probing both incidents as targeted attacks.The threatre’s CEO Jeff Knoll linked the attacks to the screening of south Asian films, adding that due to safety concerns, it had halted the screenings of Indian films ‘Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1’ and ‘They Call Him OG’.SFJ chief Pannun claimed “Make in India” was no longer a cultural label but had become a political weapon for Modi’s regime. “Every screening and every product stamped ‘Made in India’ carries the imprint of a violent ideology that is driving India toward a Hindutva totalitarian state,” he said . Allowing Indian films and products into Canadian markets, he warned, was equivalent to opening the door to propaganda that normalises violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs and undermines the values enshrined in Canada’s Charter.India and Canada had productive talks in the recent NSA-level meeting on advancing the bilateral relationship in areas such as counter terrorism, combating transnational organised crime and intelligence exchanges, said the govt responding to queries on Ottawa’s listing of the Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity.MEA said security cooperation is an important agenda of continued bilateral collaboration. “Transnational organised crime is a particular concern to both countries. All countries, in fact, must come together to fight this menace,” said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal. “They agreed to strengthen security cooperation and further reinforce existing mechanisms of engagement.”",Canadian police focus on tackling the bishnoi syndicate.

"Manipur ambush: Intel hints at ‘contract killing’ to undermine President’s rule; PLA denies role, 15 arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-ambush-intel-hints-at-contract-killing-to-undermine-presidents-rule-pla-denies-role-15-arrested/articleshow/124321150.cms,"Assam Rifles vehicle after an ambush in Nambol Sabal area last month

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an Assam Rifles convoy in Nambol, Manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing.” Officials, quoted by PTI, say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’s fragile situation, undermining President’s rule.Officials alleged that certain vested interests could be seeking to weaken President’s rule, which has helped curb severe ethnic violence in the state. According to them, these groups are promoting the view that the present administration is ineffective and pushing for the immediate reinstatement of the suspended state assembly.The attack, which killed two Assam Rifles personnel on September 19, was unusual as the PLA, a banned valley-based insurgent group, did not claim responsibility—breaking its 48-year tradition of owning operations. PTI Sources indicate the PLA leadership may have been unaware of or had not sanctioned the assault.In a major crackdown following the attack, security forces arrested 15 PLA members, including key suspects Thoungram Sadananda Singh alias Purakpa (18) and Khomdram Ojit Singh alias Keilal (47), within 72 hours of the incident. Authorities recovered six weapons likely stolen from a police armoury during earlier ethnic clashes and a van believed to have been used in the ambush.The Nambol attack, carried out in Sabal Leikai where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is not in force, marked the first assault on central forces since the outbreak of ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos in May 2023. Naib Subedar Shyam Gurung and Rifleman Ranjit Singh Kashyap were killed when their vehicle was attacked en route from Patsoi to the Nambol base.Officials are also probing potential political support for the PLA, particularly following the UNLF’s recent announcement to cease hostilities and join the Union Home Ministry’s Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement. Analysts warn that disaffected members of PLA, UNLF, KYKL, and PREPAK could exploit the ceasefire to target civilians.Thoungram Sadananda Singh had previously been with the UNLF before transferring to the PLA. The PLA, originally known as ‘Polei’, seeks Manipur’s independence and a separate Meitei homeland in the Imphal Valley. Other insurgent groups, including KYKL, PREPAK, and KCP, maintain significant presence in the valley and along the India-Myanmar border.Manipur has witnessed sustained ethnic tensions since May 2023, resulting in over 260 deaths and nearly 50,000 displaced, driven by disputes over land rights and political representation.","Intelligence agencies suspect that last month’s attack on an assam rifles convoy in nambol, manipur, may have been a politically motivated “contract killing” officials say it could have been aimed at destabilising the state’s fragile situation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124321381,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-711654,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

AI 117 incident

NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP), a pilots’ body, on Sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all Boeing 787 planes operating in India “in the interest of air safety. ”The FIP’s appeal to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) comes a day after an Air India Boeing 787 flight from Amritsar to Birmingham deployed emergency turbine power while preparing to land in the UK city. The incident, too, comes just months after another Air India Boeing 787 operating between India and the UK (Ahmedabad-London) crashed minutes after take-off in one of India’s worst aviation disasters.“It is pertinent to note that the incident (Amritsar–Birmingham) is another pointer towards the Air India crash of B-787 aircraft. Thus, in the interest of air safety, FIP insists that DGCA must thoroughly check and investigate the electrical system of B-787 aircraft in the country,” the Federation said in its letter to the DGCA, according to PTI.“There have been numerous incidents on the B-787 aircraft. We have strongly taken up with the Civil Aviation Ministry and Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) to thoroughly check the electrical system of all B-787 planes in the country,” the letter stated.The pilots’ body also highlighted that ever since the AI-171 (Ahmedabad–London) crash on June 12, it has been constantly urging a comprehensive review of the Boeing 787 electrical systems. “Subsequent to the crash, DGCA checked only the fuel control switches of B-787 in Air India (fleet),” it added.The latest incident involved the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of Air India flight AI 117 — a Boeing 787 Dreamliner — deploying during the flight's final approach, at around 400 feet, just seconds before landing. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for further checks. Notably, RAT had also deployed seconds after the ill-fated AI 171 lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.“The operating crew of flight AI-117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine RAT during its final approach. All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing,” the airline said in a statement.The RAT is a last-resort emergency power system that deploys automatically in the event of a dual engine failure or total electronic or hydraulic failure, using wind speed to generate emergency power.Engine or hydraulic/electrical failure or software malfunction are being cited as among the several probable causes of the AI 171 crash that killed 260 people, of whom 241 were onboard the flight.","The federation of indian pilots (fip), a pilots’ body, on sunday called for a thorough inspection of the electrical systems of all boeing 787 planes operating in india.

NEW DELHI: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said it doesn’t “befit” the Lok Sabha’s leader of opposition, Rahul Gandhi , to speak of Gen Z, saying that it was the young generation which ousted the Congress from power.Rijiju added that the youth support Prime Minister Narendra Modi .""It doesn't befit Rahul Gandhi to speak of Gen Z. The young generation has ousted them (Congress) from power. Gen Z means the new mindset of a new generation – it stands with PM Modi. India's Gen Z is against the control of this country in the hands of one party, one family. It is against corruption... Gen Z's anger is directed towards those who are not capable but want to run the Government, against the family that has captured the party. Our government is dedicated to people. Gen Z is against the Congress,"" the parliamentary affairs minister told ANI.The phrase “Gen Z” entered India’s political lexicon after youth-led protests led to a change of government in neighbouring Nepal.On September 18, just after his second round of presentation on alleged poll fraud, Gandhi had called on India’s Gen Z to “protect the Constitution” and pledged his support to them in stopping “vote chori (vote theft).”Responding to this, Rijiju said, ""Now, when they can't win elections, they abuse the Election Commission, put allegations of 'vote chori'. Youth are connected with Modi ji, the country stands with Modi ji.""In his first press conference in August, Gandhi had alleged electoral malpractice in the Mahadevapura assembly segment in Bengaluru, in Congress-ruled Karnataka. In the second, he focused on the Aland assembly seat, also in Karnataka.The Election Commission, which Gandhi has accused of indulging in ""vote chori"" to benefit the ruling BJP, has dismissed his allegations.Meanwhile, Gandhi has been teasing a “hydrogen bomb” after his “atom bomb” claims in the first press conference.","Kiren rijiju says it doesn't befit rahul gandhi to speak of gen z.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his recent remarks made during a visit to Colombia, claiming that he is the first leader of opposition (LoP) to speak against India on foreign soil.In an interview to ANI, the parliamentary affairs minister said, “Even Indira Gandhi ji was LoP after losing elections, but she never spoke about the country outside. All other LoPs after her - whether it is Lal Krishna Advani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sushma Swaraj, Sharad Pawar - never did that.”“Show me one LoP who has ever gone outside India and made statements against the country or the Government. Rahul Gandhi is the first LoP who goes abroad and speaks against the country, our system and our democracy,” Rijiju added.The remarks come after Rahul, while speaking at an event at EIA University in Colombia on Thursday, said, “India has strong capabilities in areas like engineering and healthcare, so I am very optimistic about the country. But at the same time, there are also flaws in the structure that India has to correct. The biggest challenge is the attack on democracy taking place in India.”Rijiju alleged that Rahul's comments misrepresent India and could harm its global image.“Our LoP went abroad and said that India cannot be a global leader. The problem is that if people abroad get the impression that everyone in India is like Rahul Gandhi, it would tarnish the country's reputation,” he said.“There are intelligent people in our country, we have good leaders and people with good ideology. But if Rahul Gandhi speaks like this, people would think that such people are higher in number in India. This is not right,” Rijiju added.The Union minister also rejected Congress’s allegations of curbs on free speech, saying that the party was misusing the idea of freedom of expression for political purposes. “From morning to evening, they keep on abusing PM Modi and say there is no freedom to speak. They want to misuse this freedom of expression to such an extent that they want to split the nation,” he said.Rijiju further claimed that some leaders advocating for free speech are those who, according to him, have supported divisive causes. “Those who talk about freedom of speech are the people who want to separate Jammu and Kashmir and the North East from the nation,” he said.He emphasised that the BJP’s response to Rahul’s remarks is not personal. “We have nothing to do with him personally. He is LoP... If he speaks irresponsibly, we will not like it,” Rijiju said.","Kiren rijiju claims rahul gandhi is the first leader of opposition to speak against india on foreign soil.

They did not go to Pakistan; they went to undivided India ... circumstances have sent us here from that home because that home and this home are not different,"" Bhagwat said.Referring further to undivided India, he added, ""The whole of India is one home, but someone has removed the one room of our house where my table, chair, and clothes used to be kept. They have occupied it.""Then calling for ""taking it back"", he said, ""Tomorrow I have to take it back and hence we have to remember that the undivided India."" His remarks drew loud applause from the audience.His remarks drew loud applause from the crowd.The RSS chief's remarks come just days after the Indian govt slammed Pakistan for the ongoing protests in POK, saying Islamabad must be held accountable for its “oppressive approach” and “horrific” human rights violations.Pakistan authorities had on Thursday confirmed that eight people had died in four days of violent protests in the region that India maintains is illegally occupied by Pakistan.“We have seen reports on protests in several areas of Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, including brutalities by Pakistani forces on innocent civilians.

It will also mark the first-ever visit of an Indian defence minister to Australia under this government since 2014,” an official said.“The visit will provide an important opportunity for both sides to explore new and meaningful initiatives to further strengthen the bilateral relationship and the defence partnership,” he added.The defence engagements have expanded over time to include wide-ranging interactions between the services, military-to-military exchanges, high-level visits, capacity-building and training programmes, cooperation in the maritime domain and combat exercises.In a meeting between Singh and Marles in June this year, the two sides had decided to intensify and diversify defence-industrial collaboration as well as steadily work together towards their shared commitment for a free and open Indo-Pacific, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.The Indian and Australian armies are slated to conduct the fourth edition of the “AustraHind” combat exercise at Irwin Barracks in Perth from Oct 13 to 26. It aims to further strengthen the operational capabilities of the two forces in undertaking joint company-level operations in urban and semi-urban terrains under the UN mandate, reflecting the shared commitment towards global peace and security, another official said.Australia -- along with Japan -- is also a regular participant in the top-notch quadrilateral Malabar naval exercise , with the next edition to be conducted off Guam in the Western Pacific next month.

Rahul Gandhi - Conferencia El futuro es hoy

'Demonetisation, GST destroying small, medium businesses'



'Cowardice at heart of RSS-BJP ideology'



'Rahul wants to fight Indian state!'



NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , accused the BJP-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on Indian democracy” during an interaction at EIA University in Colombia. The BJP hit back, calling him a “Leader of Propaganda” and criticising him for ""once again"" denigrating Indian democracy on a foreign platform.""The single biggest risk is the attack on democracy that is taking place in India because India has multiple religions, multiple traditions, multiple languages. And India actually is a conversation between all its people and different traditions, different religions, different ideas require space. And that the best method for creating that space is the democratic system. And currently there is a wholesale attack on the democratic system in India,"" Rahul said during a recent interaction with students.Contrasting Indian political system with that of China's, he said, ""This other big risk is risk between different conceptions, different parts of the country, right? Some 16, 17 different languages, different religions. So allowing these different traditions to thrive, giving them space to express themselves is very important for a country like India. We can't do what China does, which is suppress people and run authoritarian system.Our design just will not accept that.""""Most of the people, for example, who are creating polarisation in the US with Mr Trump are those who lost their jobs because of manufacturing. China has demonstrated to the world how you can manage production in a non-democratic setup, but we cannot do that; we are a democratic setup. The challenge is whether we can develop manufacturing like China but within a democratic setup,"" he added.Targeting the central government's policies, including demonetisation and GST, Rahul said that these economic policies ""destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy.""""The Government of India brought two policies - first, the demonetisation of our currency, which essentially destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy; and second, GST, which was again designed to harm medium and small businesses. We believe that supporting these small businesses is the way forward for entrepreneurship, and that’s the difference between us and those in power who believe that a few monopolies should control the economy,"" he said.""In India, we have a huge level of corruption at the centralised level. Three or four businesses are taking over the whole economy, having a direct relationship with the Prime Minister, and it is rampant in India,"" he added.Citing past statements by foreign minister S Jaishankar about China and Hindu ideologue VD Savarkar about beating up a Muslim man, Rahul said that ""cowardice was at heart of RSS-BJP ideology.""""This is the nature of BJP-RSS. If you notice a statement of the foreign minister, he said, 'China is much more powerful than us. How can I pick a fight with them?' At the heart of the ideology is cowardice,"" he said.""In his book, Savarkar has written that once he and his few friends beat up a Muslim man, and they felt very happy that day. If five people beat up a single individual, which makes one of them happy, it is cowardice. This is RSS ideology, to beat weak people,"" he added.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul for making such statements abroad.""Once again Rahul Gandhi behaves like LoP - Leader of Propaganda Goes abroad and attacks Indian Democracy! After all he wants to fight Indian state! Sometimes Demands US UK should intervene into our affairs and now this From Sena to Judiciary to Sanvidhan to Sanatan!"" he said in a post on X.Moreover, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari accused ""Gandhi-Vadra family"" of keeping India ""poor.""""Rahul Gandhi is anti-India. The one who hates India and its progress can speak such things on foreign soil that India can't be a leader. The Gandhi-Vadra family kept India poor due to such a mindset. When they see that India has emerged as a global leader and a four trillion-dollar economy under PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi is attacking India's progress and its democracy out of jealousy and disgust,"" Bhandari told ANI.""This makes it clear that Rahul Gandhi's remote control is in foreign hands. Those who don't want India to progress push Rahul Gandhi to say such things. He is not a political opponent, but leader of opposing India. He is against India's unity and integrity. 140 crore Indians are witnessing Rahul Gandhi's attempt to defame India from foreign soil,"" he added.Ravi Shankar Prasad also took aim at Gandhi saying that instead of greeting Indians on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he chose to ""speak against India.""“Rahul Gandhi is abroad. It would have been better if, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he had extended greetings to the people of the country. But instead, he chooses to speak against India. Rahul Gandhi has developed a habit of defaming the nation and questioning the freedoms enjoyed by its people, and that too while on foreign soil,"" he said.""He constantly makes false allegations against Prime Minister Modi, abuses him without shame, and claims abroad that there is no freedom of speech in India. Everything Rahul Gandhi says is baseless. When he is abroad, he says there is no democracy in India. While overseas, he insults India,"" he added.Gandhi is on a four-day South America tour, the timing of which, has already been questioned by the BJP.","Rahul gandhi accused the bjp-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on indian democracy” during an interaction at eia university in colombia.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath singh warns pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive sir creek region.

Family insists victim acted in self-defense amid growing public concern



The shocking case involving former New York Jets quarterback and NFL analyst Mark Sanchez continues to unravel, with new details shedding light on the identity of the victim and the violent nature of the encounter. Authorities have identified the man involved as a 69-year-old truck driver referred to by the initials P.T. , who was reportedly attacked during a disturbing altercation in Indianapolis that left both men hospitalized.According to police affidavits, the incident began when Sanchez allegedly entered the victim’s parked vehicle without consent, leading to a chaotic struggle.

Poll Do you think international attention can help protect activists like Greta Thunberg? Yes, it can prevent mistreatment No, it won’t make a difference

Israel refutes allegations







Eyewitnesses on a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza described environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg being dragged, beaten, and paraded by Israeli forces after her detention. The accounts depict a scene of intimidation and mistreatment that shocked those on board.An email from the Swedish foreign ministry to people close to Thunberg, citing an official who visited her in prison, said she was held in a cell infested with bedbugs, given insufficient food and water, and forced to sit for long periods on hard surfaces.“The embassy has been able to meet with Greta,” reads the email. “She informed of dehydration. She has received insufficient amounts of both water and food. She also stated that she had developed rashes which she suspects were caused by bedbugs. She spoke of harsh treatment and said she had been sitting for long periods on hard surfaces.”Another detainee reportedly told an embassy, as quoted by The Guardian, that Thunberg was forced to hold flags while pictures were taken. “She wondered whether images of her had been distributed,” the Swedish official added. These allegations were corroborated by at least two other members of the flotilla who had been detained and later released.Eyewitnesses described the treatment in more vivid detail. Turkish activist Ersin Çelik, a participant in the Sumud flotilla, told Anadolu news agency: “They dragged little Greta by her hair before our eyes, beat her, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag. They did everything imaginable to her, as a warning to others.”Lorenzo D’Agostino, a journalist and flotilla participant, said Thunberg was “wrapped in the Israeli flag and paraded like a trophy” – a scene described with disbelief and anger by those who witnessed it.During a visit to Ashdod port on Thursday night, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists.” “These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said in Hebrew, pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground. Some activists were heard shouting, “Free Palestine.” Ben-Gvir has previously called for activists to be jailed rather than deported, reported The Guardian.The Israeli foreign ministry has denied these claims calling them “brazen lies.”In a post on X Sunday, it said, “The claims regarding the mistreatment of Greta Thunberg and other detainees from the Hamas–Sumud flotilla are brazen lies. All the detainees’ legal rights are fully upheld. Interestingly enough, Greta herself and other detainees refused to expedite their deportation and insisted on prolonging their stay in custody. Greta also did not complain to the Israeli authorities about any of these ludicrous and baseless allegations - because they never occurred. ”Thunberg was among 437 activists, parliamentarians, and lawyers on the Global Sumud flotilla, a coalition of more than 40 vessels carrying humanitarian aid attempting to breach Israel’s 16-year maritime blockade of Gaza. Between Thursday and Friday, Israeli forces intercepted all the boats and arrested every crew member. Most are being held at Ketziot prison in the Negev desert, a facility primarily used for Palestinian security detainees.Lawyers representing the flotilla said that detainees were left for hours without food or water, with the exception of “a packet of crisps handed to Greta and shown to the cameras.” Instances of verbal and physical abuse were also reported.According to the NGO Adalah, detainees’ rights were “systematically violated,” including denial of water, sanitation, medication, and access to legal representatives.During a visit to Ashdod port on Thursday night, Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, was filmed calling the activists “terrorists.” “These are the terrorists of the flotilla,” he said in Hebrew, pointing at dozens of people sitting on the ground.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that Israel has agreed to an ""initial withdrawal line"" in Gaza, which has also been shared with Hamas, setting the stage for a potential ceasefire and prisoner exchange in the two-year-old conflict.Trump said in a post on Truth Social, “After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, which will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, STAY TUNED!”The announcement comes just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was “on the verge of a very great achievement.” In a statement released Saturday morning, Netanyahu said, “It is not yet final; we are working on it diligently, and I hope, with God's help, that in the coming days, during the Sukkot holiday, I will be able to inform you about the return of all our hostages, both living and deceased, in one phase, while the IDF remains deep within the Strip and in the controlling areas within it. ”The development follows Trump’s ultimatum to Hamas on Friday, giving the group a deadline of Sunday, 6 pm (Washington DC time) to accept the US-proposed peace plan.Trump had warned that “all hell, like no one has ever seen before,” would follow if Hamas failed to comply.Under the Trump plan, a phased approach is proposed, starting with the release of Israeli hostages, followed by a ceasefire and a broader peace framework. Responding to the ultimatum, Hamas confirmed on Friday that it had agreed to release all Israeli hostages, both alive and deceased, and was ready to enter mediated negotiations to finalise the details. The group stated it approved “to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal,” provided the necessary conditions were met.Trump welcomed Hamas’ announcement, saying the group had shown it was “ready for a lasting PEACE,” and urged Israel to immediately halt its air campaign. He wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East. ”","Trump says israel agrees to 'initial withdrawal line'; hints at immediate ceasefire.

Trump 'Drops In' At Defence Meet, Stuns Pete Hegseth, Top Generals; Power Move On Camera





US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday dismissed Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a powerful aide who had overseen a major reshaping of the service’s bureaucracy. The abrupt removal came shortly after the Senate confirmed Navy Undersecretary Hung Cao earlier this week.“He will no longer serve as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Navy,” the Pentagon said in a statement, confirming Harrison’s departure. “We are grateful for his service to the Department.”Harrison, working closely with Navy Secretary John Phelan, spearheaded sweeping changes to the service’s policy and budgeting offices while seeking to curb the undersecretary’s influence.Traditionally, the Navy secretary’s chief of staff operates as a behind-the-scenes aide, ensuring the office runs smoothly. But Harrison, a Trump appointee who joined in January, wielded an unusual degree of authority.Phelan and Harrison earlier reassigned aides who were meant to support Cao after his confirmation and planned to screen all future military assistants to keep control in the secretary’s office, as cited by Politico. Cao, a well-known Navy veteran and former Republican Senate candidate from Virginia, was nominated by Trump.The move comes after Hegseth dismissed several senior aides and replaced the chair of the Joint Chiefs, along with the uniformed leaders of the Navy, Air Force , and Coast Guard earlier this year.Trump has pledged to revitalize US shipbuilding, but the Navy’s largest programs remain years behind schedule, while both allies and adversaries are outpacing American shipyards.US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would dismiss senior military leaders if they failed to meet his expectations, telling reporters ahead of a rare meeting with top officers in Quantico, Virginia.“If I don't like somebody, I'm going to fire them right on the spot,” he said.Hegseth also criticized what he called “woke” policies in the US military, ordering leaders to address “decades of decay.” He also issued directives for service members, instructing them to get fit, cut their hair, and shave their beards.",Us defence secretary pete hegseth dismissed navy chief of staff jon harrison.

Tsunami HITS Japan After Russia Following 8.8 Earthquake; Alerts Issued Across Asia-Pacific





A powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.0 struck near the east coast of Honshu, Japan, late Saturday night, the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said.In a post on X, the NCS said, ""EQ of M: 6.0, On: 04/10/2025 20:51:09 IST, Lat: 37.45 N, Long: 141.52 E, Depth: 50 Km, Location: Near East Coast of Honshu, Japan."" The agency confirmed the earthquake occurred at a depth of 50 km.While no casualties have been reported, this is a developing story.Japan lies in a volcanic zone on the Pacific Ring of Fire, one of the most seismically active regions in the world. The country regularly experiences low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Powerful earthquakes, often followed by tsunamis, strike several times each century. Major recent quakes include the 2024 Noto earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, the 2004 Chuetsu earthquake, and the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995.The nation has the densest seismic network in the world, enabling experts to monitor and analyze a large number of earthquakes with high precision.Unlike many countries, Japan uses the Shindo scale to measure seismic intensity instead of magnitude. While the Richter scale records the energy released at the epicenter, the Shindo scale measures the degree of shaking at different locations. Comparable systems include the Modified Mercalli scale in the United States, the Liedu scale in China, and the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS), reported ANI.","6.0- magnitude earthquake strikes japan.

What to look for



Corporate profits

Interest rate cuts

AI optimism





Investors were bracing for turbulence on Wall Street as the US government shutdown delayed key economic reports. Yet, defying expectations, the stock market surged on Friday, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting record highs.The rally isn’t just driven by Big Tech. Though companies like Nvidia, riding the AI boom, are still performing strongly, gains are widespread across the US stock market, according to AP.Smaller companies are also thriving: the Russell 2000 index has hit a record after taking nearly four years to recover its previous peak. Gold has reached new highs, and the most popular US bond fund is on track for its strongest year in at least five.Historically, shutdowns have had little impact on markets or the broader economy, and investors expect a similar outcome this time. Many professional investors believe the market could continue to rise, even after a 35% increase since April.But if the shutdown is not hitting the market, what may impact it?Despite the optimism, some experts worry that stocks are getting expensive. Though stock prices follow the company’s profit, lately they have surged much faster than corporate profits, and the S&P 500 is now close to its priciest level since the 2000 dot-com bubble, according to the Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, which measures valuations over the past decade.Ann Miletti, head of equity investments at Allspring Global Investments, says she’s concerned about speculative stocks, especially smaller, unprofitable companies. “It’s these little bubbles that are concerning to me. When you see things like this, it’s generally not a good thing,” she said, though she remained relatively optimistic about 2026.It is worth noting that indicators of an overvalued market are notoriously unreliable in predicting downturns. Stocks can remain pricey for some time as long as investors are willing to pay the premium, AP reported.Looking ahead, the upcoming earnings season will be closely watched. PepsiCo and Delta Air Lines will release results on Thursday, followed by major banks like JPMorgan Chase.Analysts expect the S&P 500 to report an 8% growth in earnings per share compared with last year, with companies needing to show continued growth through 2025 and into 2026 despite inflation, tariffs, and economic uncertainty.Another factor behind the rally is the expectation of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and households, boost spending, and make investors willing to pay more for stocks and bonds.Traders expect at least three more rate cuts by mid-next year, with Fed officials signalling a possible easing as the job market slows. But Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed may adjust plans if inflation, which remains above the 2% target, persists.“I feel like interest rates and expectations of what the Fed is going to do are driving everything right now,” said Miletti. “If the Fed doesn’t cut as much as people are expecting, any of these areas that look a little speculative, because they’re not based on fundamentals, those areas will have some real problems.”Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, calls AI “the question of the decade.” He believes AI-related stocks are fairly valued as long as the sector continues strong growth and sales, as cited by AP.The AI boom is also helping to ease concerns about long-term interest rates and inflation. But for the benefits to last, AI must improve productivity enough to counter the rising debt levels in the US and globally.“If we do achieve these benefits for companies and for people's lives, everything can go well for years,” said Ma. “I think everyone is tying their fortunes to that ship, whether they realize it or not.”","Both the s&p 500 and the dow jones industrial average hit record highs on friday.
