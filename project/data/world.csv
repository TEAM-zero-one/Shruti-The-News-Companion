'Mother Of All Deals': PM Modi Signals New Global Trade Order As India And EU Seal Historic Pact

India working closely with European nations to expand AI-led growth: Official

New Delhi: After hosting French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai, PM Modi held bilateral meetings on Wednesday with leaders of Spain, Finland, Estonia, Croatia and Serbia, looking to further deepen cooperation in technology, innovation, security and defence with Europe, which is participating in strength in the ongoing AI Impact Summit . With 26 countries officially represented, this is the largest-ever presence of European countries at a technology-based event in India, according to official sources.In the official talks, EU leaders/members conveyed their unanimous support for early implementation of the India-EU FTA. They are also learned to have pledged support for its early ratification in the European Council and European Parliament.""They are all keen to enhance trading ties with India taking advantage of the FTA, creating new opportunities and jobs for people,"" said a govt source.At Modi's meeting with Spainish PM Pedro Sanchez, the two endorsed ongoing defence cooperation, welcoming progress in Tata-Airbus collaboration for C-295 transport aircraft final assembly line in Vadodara and stressing the importance of defence industrial collaboration based on co-development and co-production. Sanchez highlighted the importance of the AI Summit and expressed confidence that its outcomes would contribute meaningfully to shaping global AI governance, while backing closer India-Spain cooperation to leverage AI's potential for inclusive development and societal benefit.""They reiterated their strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and emphasised the need for strengthened international cooperation to combat terrorism,"" said a govt readout, adding that both PMs hailed the India-EU FTA as a major milestone that would help unlock immense trade and investment potential.Modiis expected to meet leaders from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Slovak Republic and Liechtenstein over the next two days.For India, a solid European presence was the essential ingredient for a successful AI summit, as Europe remains a hub of cutting-edge AI innovation, digital governance and responsible AI frameworks.Govt officials pointed out that EU plays a prominent role in setting global norms, including for AI, and is also the first bloc globally to enact comprehensive AI legislation. While France is playing a key role in AI governance and applications and UK had organised the first AI summit in 2023, the Netherlands and Belgium host critical companies in the semiconductor supply chain like ASML and IMEC, respectively.India working closely with European nations to expand AI-led growth: Official | page 14While Germany is Europe's leading semiconductor hub, the sources said Estonia, too, is a global leader in artificial intelligence, ranking sixth worldwide for AI startups.

New Army Video Highlights Operation Sindoor Strikes On Terror Camps And Airbases

NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack in J&K, CRPF has set up 43 temporary operating bases across the UT, each housing 16-25 personnel who will track and eliminate terrorists holed up in the higher reaches, security officials said on Wednesday.The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the Kashmir division and 17 in the Jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above. CRPF troops, accompanied by a few J&K Police personnel, use these bases for a few days at a time to launch search and assault operations against terrorists who usually use 'dhoks' (mud and stone huts) as temporary hideouts, awaiting instructions from their Pakistan-based handlers to execute terror attacks.CRPF has procured special equipment for these temporary bases, like tactical boots, winter jackets, sleeping bags and satellite phones.There are about two local terrorists and around 100 foreign terrorists active at present, according to data.The first set of such temporary bases were established by CRPF in April 2025 along the Pahalgam-Tral-Harwan axis, immediately after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.CRPF and other security forces had used one such base to zero in on the hideout of the three Pahalgam attackers, all Pakistanis, near the Dachigam area in Srinagar. All three terrorists were eliminated in Operation Mahadev in July 2025.Prior to the Pahalgam terror attack, the Pakistani terrorists had taken shelter in a dhok near the tourist site in Baisaran where they would gun down 25 tourists. The terrorists escaped into the surrounding forest soon after the attack. The security forces had to scour the forests for months before they could track their location.","The temporary bases, 26 of which are located in the kashmir division and 17 in the jammu division, sit at a height of 6,000 feet and above.

'Proud Moment For Humanity!' Social Media Roasts Galgotias University, China Reacts To Robo Dog Row

NEW DELHI: The Modi government’s ambitious AI Summit on Wednesday spiralled into a political flashpoint after opposition leaders mounted a coordinated attack over the display of a commercially available Chinese robot by Galgotias University as an in-house innovation.What began as online scepticism over the robotic dog branded “Orion” soon escalated into a broader political row, with leaders from the Trinamool Congress, CPI(M) and Shiv Sena (UBT) questioning the credibility of the summit and targeting I-T minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.The quadruped robot, showcased at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 at Bharat Mandapam and featured on DD News, was identified by observers as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available product made by Chinese robotics firm Unitree. The device is reportedly sold in India for Rs 2 to 3 lakh.Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra launched a sharp attack on Vaishnaw, who also holds the Railways and Information and Broadcasting portfolios. She shared a now-deleted post in which the minister had purportedly praised the exhibit.In the post, as was posted by the TMC leader, Vaishnaw had said: ""Bharat's sovereign models are performing well on global benchmarks.""Taking aim at the minister, Moitra wrote: ""Deleting tweets doesn’t change reality @AshwiniVaishnaw - you have made India a laughing stock. Quit the chair if you can’t do your job. Maybe join Galgotia as Professor of Spin?""CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas alleged close links between the university and BJP leaders.""Galgotias University has enjoyed the patronage and support of prominent BJP leaders, with Dr Sambit Patra to Union Minister Piyush Goyal having graced various university programmes. It is no surprise that the institution frequently emphasises the 'Viksit Bharat' slogan,"" Brittas said.""This close association was evident when the university blatantly showcased a commercially available Chinese robotic dog as an in-house invention, branding it as 'Orion' at the AI Summit, which was promoted in a tweet by none other than the IT minister! Whether ousted from the event or not, Galgotias University is set to remain firmly in the BJP's orbit,"" he said.Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi described the episode as damaging.""Galgotias University passing off Chinese robot as own invention at the AI Summit is a shame. Chinese media having a field day over it makes it worse. All this could have been avoided if before allotting the pavilions a thorough credibility check was done of companies, universities, start-ups and others,"" Chaturvedi said.""The damage this has caused for India and the Summit is big. Asking the university to vacate their pavilion was a good step, I feel some strict penalty must also be imposed on them,"" she said.Trinamool MP Saket Gokhale questioned the minister’s silence and the role of state broadcaster DD News.""A private university called Galgotias tried to pass off a Go2 Chinese robot as their own invention at the India AI Summit. But here's the real shameful part: Government-run DD News did an entire feature promoting them. Today, DD News and BJP are the same. The channel runs as a propaganda outlet for the BJP,"" Gokhale said.""Both the Ministry for Information Technology, which organised the AI Summit, and the Ministry for Information and Broadcasting, which controls DD News, are headed by the same minister. Was this fraud perpetrated with the full knowledge of Modi's minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for cheap PR?"" Gokhale asked.""Did the BJP receive anything in return from this private university for being given a platform at the summit by a government channel? This incident has become a global embarrassment. Is the purpose of the India AI Summit merely to promote Modi even through fraudulent means?"" the TMC leader asked.""Why has there been pin drop silence from Ashwini Vaishnaw and the government on this shameful incident?"" he asked.As the controversy intensified, the government asked Galgotias University to vacate its pavilion at the summit. IT Secretary S Krishnan later said the government does not want any exhibitor to showcase items that are not their own.The university subsequently issued a statement expressing regret over the confusion, saying it arose because professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.What was intended to highlight India’s AI ambitions has instead triggered a sharp political storm, with the opposition framing the episode as a question of credibility, oversight and transparency at a flagship national event.","Galgotias university reportedly displayed commercially available chinese robot as an in-house innovation.

AI Impact Summit: Facing Backlash Over China-made Robo Dog, Galgotias University Told To Leave Event

What triggered the row?

University’s earlier clarifications

Rahul Gandhi describes summit as 'disorganised PR spectacle'

NEW DELHI: Galgotias University on Wednesday apologised after a controversy erupted over the display of a Chinese-made robotic dog at its stall during the AI Impact Summit expo at Bharat Mandapam. In the statement however, the university blamed the woman professor for the fiasco.The university issued a press statement after it was asked to vacate its pavilion at the summit. In the statement, it expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.“We at Galgotias University, wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press... Understanding the organisers sentiment we have vacated the premises. ”The robotic dog, showcased as “Orion,” was identified by observers as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot manufactured by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics and sold in India for around Rs 2–3 lakh.The incident drew criticism, as the summit was meant to highlight domestic innovation in artificial intelligence, and the robot was alleged to have been presented as an in-house creation.Government sources earlier said Galgotias University was asked to vacate its stall following the row. Power supply to the pavilion was also reportedly cut off after the university was directed to leave the expo.The AI Impact Summit 2026, inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a flagship event focused on promoting India’s advancements and capabilities in artificial intelligence.The controversy escalated after Professor Neha Singh, while presenting the robot earlier, told DD News, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus. So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.”“It's quite naughty also. It's quite naughty also and it can perform small tasks of surveillance, monitoring,” she added.Her remarks led to scrutiny after observers identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, a product sold globally by Unitree Robotics.In its first clarification issued after the row broke out, the university stated that it had neither built nor claimed to have built the robotic dog, emphasising that its focus was on student learning.“Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat. Innovation knows no borders. Learning should not either. We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ”In a subsequent statement, the university said concerns about “propaganda” against it were misplaced.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh also addressed the controversy, saying, “The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly, so I may not have come across as eloquently as I usually do. Also, the intent may not have been properly understood. One important point is regarding the robot dog—we cannot claim that we manufactured it. I have told everyone that we introduced it to our students to inspire them to create something better on their own. Our university contributes to building future leaders by providing cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI, and it will continue to do so.”The issue also drew sharp reactions from the Opposition.The Congress party said on X: “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own. The Chinese media has mocked us. This is truly embarrassing for India. What is even more shameful is the fact that Modi’s minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is indulging in the same falsehood, promoting China's robots at the Indian summit.”“The Modi Government has caused irreparable damage to the image of the country - they have reduced AI to a joke - a field in which we could be world leaders given our data power,” it added.Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi described the summit as a “disorganised PR spectacle.” In a post on X, he said, “Instead of leveraging India's talent and data, the AI summit is a disorganised PR spectacle - Indian data up for sale, Chinese products showcased.”",Galgotias university apologises after controversy over display of chinese-made robotic dog at its stall during the ai impact summit expo at bharat mandapam.

'Switzerland actively contributing to development of technical standards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/switzerland-actively-contributing-to-development-of-technical-standards/articleshow/128533580.cms,"Swiss President Guy Parmelin

How should countries deal with

AI regulation

? Is there a need to have a new agency? Will a regulatory set up stifle innovation and development of AI but how do you deal with challenges such as deep fake?

Switzerland is chairing the OSCE for the third time this year. In that capacity, what are you proposing to do to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Also, what do you make of India’s efforts to reach out to both sides for a ceasefire and return to dialogue and diplomacy?

Last one year has been turbulent for trade? How much cushion have trade deals such as those with India provided?

Given unilateral tariff actions over the last 10 months, what is the way forward ad WTO’s powers are completely undermined and there is a rush of bilateral trade agreements around the globe?

The global order is changing, whether it is trade, arms reduction or countries threatening or attacking others. Where are things headed, is this a transition phase?

Some believe that migration concerns are hyped up and there is a need get people to help at a time when European population is declining. But migrants come with their own challenges, especially problems with adjustment and backlash. How do you balance the two at a time when you are seeing a backlash against certain migrant groups?

Swiss President Guy Parmelin backs a governance framework for AI that does not rely on a single instrument and calls for societal norms that guide users. Excerpts from an interview with TOI:Over the past 200 years, mankind has established thousands of legal, technical and societal norms to “regulate” the development and use of engines in a vast number of different machines and vehicles, with different levels of harmonization, based on the specific context of use. Like engines, we think that also AI cannot be “regulated” by a single instrument, but we will need to develop a governance framework consisting of many instruments to cover different aspects of the development and use of AI. Switzerland is therefore actively contributing to the development of technical standards for AI, of binding and nonbinding legal instruments, like the recommendations of UNESCO or the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the Council of Europe framework convention on AI, which has been elaborated among 55 countries from all around the world and is the first binding international treaty on AI. But we also need societal and cultural norms that guide us when using AI in our specific contexts.Under the first priority of its OSCE Chairpersonship (“Helsinki Principles – for lasting peace”), Switzerland is committed to a just peace in Ukraine, based on international law and the Helsinki Principles. In his capacity as OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis visited Kyiv (Feb 2) and Moscow (Feb 5-6) together with the OSCE secretary general to offer dialogue and to make sure all relevant actors know what the OSCE could contribute in the context of a negotiated settlement.Ultimately, it is up to the States to decide whether to make use of it.Free trade agreements such as the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) are an important tool, especially in challenging times for trade policy. They enable the Swiss export industry to tap into new markets and diversify. This strengthens Switzerland’s standing as a business location and boosts its ability to generate added value, create new jobs and preserve existing ones.The WTO has long been under severe stress, but despite institutional paralysis, around 74% of global trade still takes place on MFN terms, underscoring the system’s continued relevance. It remains the only global institution that monitors members’ trade measures and offers a permanent forum for dialogue among 166 economies. In a context of rising tensions and challenges to established rules, Switzerland will continue to champion multilateralism and support WTO reform to preserve rules-based trade. WTO members broadly share this view: they have repeatedly signalled strong willingness to engage in meaningful reform, especially in view of the 14th WTO Ministerial Conference.The international order is undergoing a deep and far-reaching transformation. Democracy is under pressure worldwide. Tariffs are being raised, trade agreements dismantled, international rules ignored. It is not the rule of law that prevails, but the rule of might. Joint solutions are pushed aside by unilateral action. Great powers assert their interests, some wage wars to restore old empires. So, today, we are at a turning point. A turning point between progress and regression, between global cooperation and geopolitical rivalry. Between democratic renewal and authoritarian relapse. We have to actively shape this transformation. In this context, Switzerland is keen to diversify and deepen its relations with democratic partners like India that are proponents of international law and the rules-based international order and have considerable global influence and reach.Switzerland recognizes that human mobility is a global phenomenon. People have always moved in response to economic, social, political, security and environmental challenges, in search of opportunities and/or safety. Fair, regular and safe migration can be a driver of sustainable development and of economic resilience, growth and prosperity for both countries of origin and destination. However, unsafe and irregular migration come with risks and challenges, even more so for young people and women. Switzerland – as a small but highly globalized country - has a strong interest in an international system of migration governance that addresses the risks associated with unsafe migration and forced displacement while leveraging the benefit of migration for the economy and the people. To address challenges but also build on opportunities, Switzerland’s foreign policy on migration is characterized by a partnership approach with countries of origin, transit and destination.","Swiss president guy parmelin backs a governance framework for ai that does not rely on a single instrument and calls for societal norms that guide users.

New Delhi: Current frontier models of AI are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the US and China, while most other countries are ""passive victims of things they built"", Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at University of Montreal, said at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Wednesday.Emphasising that only a handful of countries leading this domain is ""unacceptable"", Bengio, who is widely considered as an AI pioneer said nations must take this up at the highest diplomatic level. Frontier models in AI are the most advanced, large-scale, general-purpose machine learning models that currently push the boundaries of capability, multimodality (text, image, audio, video), and performance.Yoshua said it's not just a question of morality, but also sovereignty. He added this is also related to concentration of power. ""If AI capability continues to grow, there's a real possibility that there'll be a huge discrepancy, even more than there is now, between the models, let's say, in the US and China and the models that are being developed in other countries. And that could give those two countries or whoever is leading huge economic power. .."", noting that ""...the stability, the geopolitical stability that we've known since the Second World War could just go up in flames.I'm not saying it's going to happen, but when you introduce so much power and when it is concentrated in such a way, there's a real danger that you're going to break the house.""These observations are significant at a time when India is spearheading the campaign for democratising AI.On what India should be careful with regard to AI, Bengio said people should be mindful of the effects or the risks that are being taken that are going to affect society while developing the technologies. ""We need to understand it scientifically. We need to understand it socially because there's a social component psychologically in the case of AI because we're talking about systems that interact with people and language. So, a country like India could contribute to that understanding,"" he said.He also said there is a dire need to carry out independent risk assessment before deploying open AI models. ""If the risks are not too large compared to the benefits, because clearly there are benefits to sharing, in particular in developing countries like here in India, then sure, you should absolutely go open. But if you see that the risks cross a threshold of social accessibility, then you should not. So this way we might be able to get the benefits of open source when it makes sense and we could prevent catastrophic uses otherwise,"" Bengio said.The professor also drew a parallel to how thorough risk assessment is carried out before allowing the sale of medicines and the same should be followed when using Artificial Intelligence in the public.""You can't do whatever you want that's going to make you money. You need to first show to an independent party, like representing the govt, that your product is not going to be harmful. But there's no such thing right now. It's a scandal,"" he said.","Current frontier models of ai are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the us and china.

India Displays Naval Might At International Fleet Review 2026, President Murmu Lauds Indian Navy

NEW DELHI: Reviewing the International Fleet Review (IFR) 2026 off the coast of Visakhapatnam , President Droupadi Murmu — the supreme commander of the armed forces — said on Wednesday “the spirit of friendship on display today through participation of so many friendly-foreign countries highlights the truth that we are collected rather than divided by the seas. India’s approach to international relations, including the maritime domain, is guided by our ethos of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam’ or ‘the world is one family’.”“This approach reflects the wisdom that global security, growth, sustainability, and stability are built through friendship,” she said.The President said the Indian Navy is vigilant in safeguarding the country’s maritime interests and contributing to stability across the wider maritime commons. Navy units deployed in the region serve as credible instruments of deterrence and defence against threats and challenges arising in the seas, she said, adding the Indian Navy is often the first responder in times of humanitarian crises and natural disasters, extending quick assistance with compassion and competence.Over 74 countries participated in the IFR, marking a grand maritime spectacle. Eighty-five ships, including 19 foreign warships, participated in the fleet review, reflecting the scale and diversity of maritime participation.The Indian fleet included 60 ships of the Indian Navy, four Indian Coast Guard vessels, and one ship each from the Shipping Corporation of India and the National Institute of Ocean Technology.The review also featured three Indian Navy submarines, one French Atlantique maritime patrol aircraft, and participation by over 60 aircraft, underscoring the multi-domain operational capability and the coordinated maritime presence on display.The President also reviewed the Indian naval air arm, marked by a flypast of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. This was followed by a mobile column of warships and submarines steaming past the Presidential yacht. The IFR will be followed by the MILAN exercise. To welcome foreign delegates and naval personnel, the Navy has set up a MILAN village in the coastal city.The IFR reaffirmed India’s commitment to maritime cooperation, interoperability and collective security, in keeping with the theme “United Through Oceans”, while highlighting the Navy’s indigenous capability, operational professionalism and enduring partnerships with like-minded navies.On the sides of the fleet review, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi held a bilateral interaction with US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Stephen T Koehler. The meeting on Tuesday focused on MALABAR and RIMPAC exercises, and on strengthening interoperability.

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday criticised the United States and China, alleging that ""western countries spread fundamentalism,"" and asserting that India holds solutions to many of the world's problems.Speaking at a Shodharthi Samvad programme at Lucknow University, Bhagwat said, ""Western countries spread fundamentalism. Their thinking is to become powerful, live on their own, and abandon the rest, eliminating those who become obstacles. This is what America and China are doing today.""Bhagwat maintained that India can offer solutions to global crises but must first strengthen itself.""Today, India has the answers to the problems the world is facing. If we want to become a world leader, we must become powerful in all areas. The world only believes it when truth is backed by power,"" he said.""Research plays a major role in changing India's direction and condition. Truthful information should be brought to light. We will not be able to understand India through ignorance,"" he added.He further alleged that Western powers had distorted India's traditional education system.""Westerners have messed with education. They replaced our education system and imposed their own, so they could find black Englishmen to do the work. What the British did wrong must be rectified,"" he said.""Today globalisation means marketisation, which is dangerous. We talk about Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. That means we consider the entire world as our family. Unless everyone is happy, no one can be happy,"" he said.""Therefore, our lives should be restrained, not consumerist. A life of restraint and sacrifice is in our cultural self-realisation,"" he added.Speaking on religion, Bhagwat said that religion remains eternally relevant and governs the laws by which the universe operates. ""The eternal nature of religion is always relevant. Religion is the laws by which the universe operates. Not a single speck of dust can be secular,"" he said.""Religion brings happiness to everyone. Religion is applicable in everything we do. Our behaviour changes according to religion, country, and time. Religion tells us that we should live with everyone, not alone,"" he added.Bhagwat also stressed the importance of environmental protection, urging people to adopt sustainable practices in daily life.Earlier on Tuesday, Bhagwat expressed concern over ""a decline in the Hindu population"". According to a release, he called for a halt to religious conversions allegedly driven by greed or coercion.He said the process of ""Ghar Wapsi"" (homecoming) should be accelerated and that those who return to Hinduism must be supported.Bhagwat further stated that Hindus should have at least three children.

Magenta mail and a 13-minute leap into history



From balloons to biplanes: The making of Henri Pequet



On a winter evening in 1911, as the sun dipped over the confluence city of Prayagraj, a small crowd gathered on the banks of Yamuna to witness what many believed was little more than a spectacle. Kumbh Mela pilgrims thronged the city, traders and farmers moved through the UP Exhibition grounds, and curious onlookers looked out for a strange contraption of wood, fabric and wire. Few were aware that they were about to watch a moment that would quietly reshape global communication.At around 5.30 pm on February 18, 1911, French aviator Henri Pequet climbed into his Heavyland aircraft, its engine clinking against the evening air. In the cockpit, alongside fuel and instruments, were 6,500 letters — ordinary envelopes entrusted to an extraordinary experiment. When Pequet lifted off, crossing the Yamuna and steering towards Naini, he carried with him not just mail, but the idea that any distance could be conquered by air.The flight lasted just 13 minutes. It covered roughly 15 kilometres, from the exhibition grounds in Prayagraj to a landing site near Naini Junction, close to what is now the Central Jail. But the journey's brevity concealed its significance.This was the world’s first official airmail service, launched from colonial India at a time when powered flight itself was barely eight years old. Around one lakh people, according to contemporary accounts, watched in astonishment as the machine rose, crossed the river, and descended safely on the other side.The setting was as symbolic as the event. The UP Exhibition, an agricultural and industrial fair, had brought together innovation and tradition on the riverbanks. Two aircraft had been shipped in parts by British officers and assembled in full public view, turning engineering into theatre. The airmail flight was staged as a highlight, but its implications would ripple far beyond the fairgrounds.More than a century later, postal services have transformed beyond recognition, from fragile biplanes to drones and satellites. Yet, India’s role in inaugurating the airmail era remains a lesser-known chapter in aviation and communication history.On that February evening in 1911, amid pilgrims, farmers and curious citizens, a modest flight across the Yamuna quietly launched a global revolution in how the world sends its messages.Long before engines roared and wings of fabric and wood lifted off the ground, messages travelled on feathers. For at least two thousand years, pigeons have carried letters across distances that were otherwise difficult, dangerous or slow to traverse. A small note would be tied to the bird’s leg, released from a distant point, and the trained pigeon would instinctively fly back to its home loft—where the intended recipient waited.Ancient civilisations relied on this method with remarkable sophistication. The Romans used homing pigeons to relay military and administrative messages; the Greeks employed them to announce the results of sporting contests; Persian and Chinese networks also integrated pigeons into their communication systems. In many ways, these birds formed one of the earliest organised long-distance messaging systems.The practice did not vanish with antiquity. In the late 19th century, a structured pigeon-based postal service briefly operated in New Zealand. Between 1897 and 1901, the New Zealand Pigeon Post carried messages between the mainland and Great Barrier Island, issuing stamps that are today prized by philatelists. It was an ingenious solution to geographic isolation in an era when reliable telegraph or ferry services were still developing.Yet pigeon post had an inherent limitation that often went unremarked. The bird could only fly home. To send a message from a remote location, someone first had to transport the pigeon there—usually confined in a cage. Even the earliest “airmail” required its own logistics chain.Against this backdrop, the leap from pigeon legs to powered flight was not just technological; it was conceptual. When Henri Pequet carried mail across the Yamuna in 1911, he was building on centuries of experiments in conquering distance—this time with a machine, not a bird, and with the promise of transforming how nations would communicate.The idea itself was quite audacious for its time. According to Postmaster General Krishna Kumar Yadav, Colonel Y Wyndham first approached postal authorities with a proposal that sounded closer to fantasy than policy: sending mail by aeroplane. The postal chief of the day gave his consent, and preparations began for what would become a landmark experiment in communication.The mail bag prepared for the flight was intentionally distinctive. It carried the markings “First Air Mail” and “Uttar Pradesh Exhibition, Allahabad,” with an illustration of an aircraft printed on it. Instead of the customary black ink, magenta was used, giving the consignment a distinctive identity.Organisers were acutely aware of the aircraft’s limitations. Weight was a critical concern, and strict calculations were done to ensure the load would not exceed what the machine could lift. Each letter was weighed, restrictions were imposed, and finally, the number of items was capped at 6,500. The flight itself would last only 13 minutes, but everything leading up to it had been planned with military precision.Yadav, who has noted down India’s postal history in his book 'India Post: 150 Glorious Years' notes that the service was not merely symbolic; it was also structured as a special premium offering. A surcharge of six annas was levied on each letter, and the proceeds were donated to the Oxford and Cambridge Hostel in Allahabad. The hostel became the nerve centre of this unusual operation. Letters were accepted for booking until noon on February 18, and the rush was such that the building resembled a miniature General Post Office. The postal department had to deploy three to four staff members on-site to handle the volume.Within days, nearly 3,000 letters had reached the hostel for onward transmission by air, a testament to the novelty and prestige attached to the service. Among the senders were local elites—rajas, maharajas, princes, and prominent citizens of Prayagraj, eager to have their names associated with history.One envelope even bore a postage stamp worth Rs 25, an extraordinary sum at the time, underscoring how much symbolic value people placed on this pioneering flight.Henri Pequet’s journey to the banks of the Yamuna was anything but straightforward. Born on February 1, 1888, in Bracquemont, a small town in France’s Seine-Inférieure region, he was drawn to flight at a time when aviation was still an experiment more than a profession. He began in 1905 with balloon flights under the guidance of Baudry, later moving on to work with the dirigible Ville de Paris built by Paulham. These early years were spent learning the fundamentals of aeronautics, often through trial, error, and mechanical improvisation.By 1908, Pequet was working at the Voisin brothers’ aircraft factory in Mourmelon, one of the pioneering centres of European aviation. His transition from mechanic to pilot was almost accidental. While on an assignment in Châlons to repair an aircraft abandoned in a field after its Anzani engine failed, Pequet secured permission to test the plane himself. It was there that he experienced the thrill of controlling an aircraft for the first time, discovering a talent that would soon define his career.The following year, he was hired as a pilot and mechanic by Chilean aviation entrepreneur José Luis Sánchez. In 1909, Pequet travelled to Johannisthal, near Berlin, to attend an aviation meeting. Circumstances led him to replace another pilot, Edwards, on a flight, on a condition that he would no longer be employed as a mechanic. On October 30, he took off, executed a short but controlled flight, and landed smoothly. The performance marked his emergence as a professional aviator.Pequet soon returned to the Voisin factory and went on to participate in aerial exhibitions in Argentina, flying Voisin biplanes powered by 60-horsepower engines. On March 24, 1910, he made a notable flight at Villa Lugano. Later that year, he returned to France and enrolled at the Voisin brothers’ flying school in Reims, earning his pilot’s brevet from the Aéro-Club de France on June 10, 1910, with licence number 88.Less than a year later, the young French aviator would find himself in colonial India, piloting an aircraft over the Yamuna and writing a small but enduring chapter in the history of global postal and aviation.","In 1911, french aviator henri pequet carried mail across the yamuna. It was the world’s first official airmail service, launched from colonial india. Around one lakh people watched in astonishment as the machine rose and descended. Henri pequet took off from allahabad on february 18, 1910, to send mail by air.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128510387,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-424249,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Congress In Damage Control Mode After Mani Shankar Aiyar’s Baton Remark To Kerala Chief Minister

NEW DELHI: Veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Wednesday doubled down on his recent remarks in which he described himself as a “Gandhian”, a “Nehruvian” and a “Rajivian”, but not a “Rahulian”.The sidelined leader said that he is not a “Rahulian” because Rahul Gandhi is “far too much younger” than him and “far too distant” in his political life.Speaking to PTI, Aiyar said, “I recently said that ‘I am a Gandhian, I am a Nehruvian, I am a Rajivian, but I am not a Rahulian’.”Explaining why he described himself as a “Gandhian”, Aiyar said, “I was six-year-old and my brother was four when Mahatma Gandhi picked us up in his arms and said ‘ye mere aankhon ke suraj aur chand hain’.” “From there, I became a ‘Gandhivaadi’.”On his identification with India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, he said, “As for Nehru, I was six when he became the prime minister, and I was 23 when he ceased being one, so my entire growing-up years were steeped in the Nehruvian ethos; that is why I also regard myself as a Nehruvian.”Aiyar said he considers himself a “Rajivian” because of his association with former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.“I call myself a Rajivian because it was he, although two years younger than me, who astonished me by bringing me into the PMO and by doing the things he did… I could not believe it. That is how I became a Rajivian,” he said.He also clarified that he did not describe himself as an “Indiravian” as he “totally disapproved” of Indira Gandhi “converting our democracy into a tyranny by declaring an Emergency, albeit for only 18 months”.Referring to his comment on Rahul Gandhi, Aiyar said, “How can one expect me to be a ‘Rahulian’ when the boy is about 30 years younger than me, and I haven’t had an opportunity to work with him? That is why I cannot be a ‘Rahulian’ because he is far too much younger than me and far too distant from me in his political life.”The remarks come amid strained ties between Aiyar and the Congress leadership. The controversy began after he praised the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala and expressed confidence that the chief minister would continue in office.Speaking at an international seminar in Thiruvananthapuram, Aiyar had said, “So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am sure will be the next chief minister, I renew my plea that to reinforce Kerala as the best Panchayati Raj state in the country, state laws should be amended based on practical experience, Thomas Isaac's insights, the five-volume report I chaired and the note on district planning by V Ramachandran circulated by the Planning Commission when it truly supported Panchayati Raj. ”The Congress distanced itself from his remarks. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said that Aiyar “has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years” and that he speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said that the people of Kerala would bring the Congress-led United Democratic Front back to power in the state.","Veteran congress leader mani shankar aiyar doubled down on his recent remarks in which he described himself as a ‘gandhian’, a “nehruvian” and a ”rajivian .

Burner account allegations on Kevin Durant explained



The Houston Rockets forward Kevin Durant faced reporters after screenshots from a private X group chat went viral, tying an account named @GetHigher77 to comments made about teammates. The posts spread like wildfire with a lot of speculation surrounding the NBA veteran.Durant did not engage in a lengthy defense. He did not confirm ownership of the account either. With Houston sitting at 33-20 and fourth in the Western Conference, the focus inside the building remains on basketball. However, outside the building, KD has been under scrutiny, which propelled him to respond to the allegations sparked against his name.Kevin Durant addressed the situation directly when asked after practice. “I know you got to ask these questions, but I’m not here to get into Twitter nonsense,” Durant said. “I’m just here to focus on the season, keep it pushing,” KD told the reporters.Watch KD’s backstage interview—When pressed about whether he had spoken with teammates regarding the chatter, he shared, “My teammates know what it is. We’ve been locked in the whole season.Enjoyed our break. Had a great practice today, looking forward to the road trip.”Durant neither claimed nor denied the account. He labeled the discussion “Twitter nonsense” and shifted attention back to the court.The controversy began when screenshots surfaced from a group chat on X. The account @GetHigher77 allegedly posted messages from Durant’s perspective and criticized teammates, including Alperen Şengün and Jabari Smith Jr. One message reportedly referred to the Rockets as a weak team with NSFW words. There is no verified proof that the account belongs to Durant.Fans reacted quickly because of history. In 2017, while with the Golden State Warriors, Durant admitted to using secret accounts to defend himself after leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder. He later acknowledged the mistake publicly.Durant is among the NBA’s most active players on social media, with millions of followers and years of frequent posting.For now, the facts remain limited. The account’s ownership is unconfirmed. Durant has dismissed the allegations and reiterated his focus on the season. The Rockets continue their push in the Western Conference while the online debate runs in parallel.","Houston rockets forward kevin durant faced reporters after screenshots from a private x group chat went viral.

"Air Force One will be painted red, white, blue as Trump hinted, US military says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/air-force-one-will-be-painted-red-white-blue-as-trump-hinted-us-military-says/articleshow/128535461.cms,"Air Force One (Image credit: Boeing)





WASHINGTON: A red, white and blue colour scheme championed by President Donald Trump will become the new look for Air Force One, the US military said Thursday.The Air Force said a ""red, white, gold and dark blue paint scheme"" will be used for the updated jet that is slated to serve as Air Force One as well as other, smaller jets that routinely fly other top government officials.The military released a rendering of the new look that matches an airplane model that has been seen in the Oval Office for meetings with foreign leaders.Boeing is in the process of modifying two of its 747-800 aircraft that are slated to replace the existing fleet of two aging Boeing 747-200 aircraft that the president currently uses and that take on the Air Force One call sign when the president is aboard.In 2018, Trump directed that those new jets would ditch the iconic Kennedy-era blue-and-white design for a white-and-navy colour scheme. Instead, the top half of the plane would have been white, while the bottom, including the belly, would have been dark blue. A streak of dark red would have run from the cockpit to the tail. The colouring was almost identical to the exterior of Trump's personal plane.An Air Force review had suggested the darker colors would increase costs and delay delivery of the new jumbo jets, and President Joe Biden reversed the decision in March 2023.Trump told reporters last month that ""we want power blue, not baby blue,"" referring to the current colour of the aircraft.""Everything has its time and place. We'll be changing the colors,"" Trump added.The Air Force's statement says a third 747-8i Boeing jet will be painted in the same colours.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth formally accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar last May for use as Air Force One despite questions about the ethics and legality of taking the expensive gift from a foreign nation.Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told lawmakers last June that the security modifications to the jet would cost less than USD 400 million but provided no details.","The air force said a ""red, white, gold and dark blue paint scheme"" will be used for the updated jet.
