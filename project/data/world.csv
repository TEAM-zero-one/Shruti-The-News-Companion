This may seem very hard to believe, but now is probably the safest time to be alive. Murder rates in India are at their lowest since we started tracking such data, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).And it’s the same story for most countries globally. NCRB started releasing data for murder and culpable homicide in 1957. In that year, India’s murder rate per lakh was 2.57. By 2023, the latest year for which NCRB has released its data, this had dropped to 2.25.The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping. It fell below 4 in 2001, and dropped to under 3 in 2013.Among large states that registered more than 1,000 cases of murder and culpable homicide, the rate is the highest in Jharkhand – at 3.8 per lakh population. Jharkhand is followed by Haryana, Chattisgarh, Assam, Odisha and Telangana – each reporting a rate of 3 or higher. Globally, Japan is the safest country and South Africa the most dangerous, according to World Bank data. Japan, in 2020 – the last year for which comparable data across countries is available – saw only 0.3 murders per lakh population.","The murder rate rose steadily since 1957, and peaked in the 1990s, after which it has kept dropping.

26/11 attack: Chidambaram says foreign pressure blocked retaliation; BJP hits out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-fallout-chidambaram-says-foreign-pressure-blocked-retaliation-bjp-hits-out/articleshow/124244271.cms,"BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday launched a major onslaught on Congress over former Union minister P Chidambaram ’s statement that foreign pressure restrained the Manmohan Singh govt from retaliating against Pakistan after the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, saying the country has “paid a heavy price” for sins committed by Congress.BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said Chidambaram’s comments have raised a big question as to “how weak the govt headed by Singh was”. “P Chidamabram, home minister in the Manmohan Singh govt, has now admitted that after the 26/11 attacks, he favoured retaliatory action against Pakistan, but the external affairs department... did not agree, and Singh remained silent,” he said, seeking answers from Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi as to what compulsions prevented them from acting on the home minister’s suggestions. “It took around 16–17 years for Chidambaram to acknowledge that they failed to give a decisive response to Pakistan for the 26/11 attacks. Why was this wisdom kept hidden for so long? It took years to arrive at this realisation; it’s shameful. The foreign ministry and other ministries overruled the matter, and Singh just watched as the country suffered. Hundreds were killed; the attacks were clearly linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.”Contrasting Congress’s response with the surgical strikes, air strikes and Operation Sindoor conducted by India under PM Modi, Prasad asked, “Who was running the country then? Where was Sonia Gandhi?”In a TV interview, Chidambaram said India had considered military retaliation after the 26/11 attacks but chose not to do so, apparently under pressure from other countries. “The whole world was descending upon Delhi to tell us don’t start a war... For example, Condoleezza Rice, who was then (US) secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over to meet me and the PM and to say, please don't react. I said this is a decision which the govt will take. ”“Without disclosing any official secret, it did cross my mind that we should do some act of retribution.” he added. Chidambaram said the PM had discussed this even when the attack was going on ... and “the conclusion was largely influenced by the MEA and IFS (Indian Foreign Service) that the Indian govt should not physically react to the situation”.BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said that instead of taking action against Pakistan after 26/11 attack, UPA govt just seven months later agreed to address Pakistan’s unsubstantiated accusation about India stoking trouble in Balochistan.",Former union minister p chidambaram said foreign pressure restrained the manmohan singh govt from retaliating against pakistan after the 26/11 terror attack on mumbai.

Was in Mumbai During 26/11, Worked with ISI and Lashkar e Taiba: Tahawwur Rana's Shocking Confession

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party launched a sharp attack on former Union home minister P Chidambaram over his recent remarks on the UPA government's decision not to retaliate militarily against Pakistan following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, accusing the Congress of “mishandling” the situation under foreign pressure.Reacting to Chidambaram’s statements made during an interview, union minister Pralhad Joshi posted on X, “After 17 years, Chidambaram, former home minister, admits what the nation knew - 26/11 was mishandled due to pressure from foreign powers. Too little, too late.”In the interview, Chidambaram said that the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action. He said this decision was influenced largely by the ministry of external affairs and senior diplomats.“The whole world descended upon Delhi to tell us 'don't start a war'. Condoleezza Rice, who was then US secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over… to say, 'please don't react',” he said.Also read: PM Modi's 'Operation Sindoor' post: Congress takes '3rd umpire' jibe, says battlefield comparison not app

Chidambaram, who took over as home minister just days after the attack, also acknowledged that he discussed possible retributive steps with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other key figures.“The Prime Minister had discussed this even when the attack was going on... And the conclusion was, largely influenced by the ministry of external affairs and the IFS, that we should not physically react to the situation,” he recalled.The remarks have sparked a political row, with BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla questioning whether then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi had overruled Chidambaram’s personal view in favour of retaliation.Posting on X, he wrote, “Why was UPA taking orders from [Condoleezza Rice]? Why did Sonia Gandhi prevail over the Home Minister?” he asked.Poonawalla further accused the Congress of giving Pakistan a “clean chit” not only on the 26/11 attacks but also in the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombing case. He alleged that the UPA government advanced a “Hindu terror” narrative and granted Pakistan ‘most favoured nation’ (MFN) status despite repeated cross-border terror incidents.He added, “Congress gave clean chit to Pak on 26/11 and Samjhauta & induced Hindu Terror angles. Today too they doubt Surgical Strike, Balakote and Operation Sindoor.”On November 26, 2008, ten heavily armed Pakistani terrorists carried out coordinated attacks across Mumbai, killing over 166 people and injuring hundreds. One attacker, Ajmal Kasab, was captured alive and later executed in 2012.","P chidambaram said the idea of retaliation “did cross [his] mind”, but the government eventually decided against military action.

NEW DELHI: Incidents of extremist, insurgent and terrorist violence have recorded a sharp fall from 446 in 2022 to 163 in 2023. The decline spans across categories, with left-wing extremism, jihadi terrorism and North-East insurgency showing significant reductions.The steepest fall has been in jihadi terrorist activities, which dropped from 126 in 2022 to just 15 in 2023. Violence linked to North-East insurgents also came down to 10 cases, from 26 in 2022, according to the NCRB 2023 report.While the civilian casualties have decreased, the number of police and army personnel killed has risen. The report also noted a steep increase in arms and ammunition looted by the extremists.The report said that incidents of insurgency int he North-East reduced by over 61% compared to 2022, and Left-wing extremist violence dipped by over 44%. Jihadi terrorist activities saw the sharpest decline — over 87% — followed by “other terrorist” incidents, down by more than 77%. Registered cases too reflected this pattern, with a fall of more than 58%.The total casualties — civilians and security personnel — fell from 118 in 2022 to 103 in 2023.However, within this figure, deaths among police, state and army personnel rose by 50%. With fewer operations, extremist fatalities also dropped by more than 54%, from 131 to 60.Number of surrenders has also fallen, from 417 in 2022 to 318 in 2023, marking a 23% decline, according to the report. Of these, 316 were left-wing extremists. Among North-East insurgency-related crimes in 2023, 85% were categorised under “unlawful activities”.A major concern flagged in the NCRB report is the spike in looted weapons. In 2023, extremists seized 706 arms and 19,946 rounds of ammunition from police and central armed police forces. This is dramatically higher than 2022, when only 36 arms and 99 rounds were reported stolen.","Incidents of extremist, insurgent and terrorist violence have recorded a sharp fall from 446 in 2022 to 163 in 2023.

Prepare to deal with biothreats , says CDS



NEW DELHI: With the Army , Navy and Air Force yet to resolve their differences over the creation of integrated theatre commands, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the armed forces must break their old institutional silos and move together towards “jointness” to deal with adversaries and challenges across all domains, including cyber & information warfare.The evolving character of warfare, combined with the complex interplay of traditional and non-traditional threats, makes jointness “a core operational necessity” and a fundamental requirement for national security rather than a matter of choice, Singh said.“While each of our Services possesses the capacity to respond independently, the interconnected nature of land, sea, air, space & cyberspace makes collaborative strength the true guarantor of victory,” he said, speaking at a seminar organised by IAF.“Our govt’s objective is to further promote jointness & integration among the three Services. This is not only a matter of policy but a matter of survival in the fast-changing security environment.”India must step-up preparedness to deal with biothreats as well as radiological contamination from nuclear weapons in the future, even though the possibility of the latter is low, CDS General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday.Noting that the world has been through a period of intense trials and tribulations during Covid-19 pandemic, the CDS said biothreats — man-made, accidental or natural — are likely to increase in future. “While possibility of use of nuclear weapons in our context is low, it is prudent to take this into our security calculus,” he said.","Rajnath singh said the armed forces must break their old institutional silos and move together towards ‘jointness’ the evolving character of warfare, combined with the complex interplay of traditional and non-traditional threats, makes jointness ‘a core operational necessity’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124244172,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1158104,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Should India prioritize expanding its ties with the EU over its relationship with Russia? Yes, focus on the EU No, maintain ties with Russia

The 13th round of India-EU negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) this month was a missed opportunity, but the EU remains committed to concluding a “meaningful package” by the end of this year, EU ambassador to India Herve Delphin has said. India and the EU will hold another round of FTA talks in Brussels on October 6, hoping to close several chapters that both sides could not in the last round here.Delphin’s remarks confirm that there are lingering issues that both sides need to address to be able to meet the year-end deadline. EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, who visited India this month, had said that he expected more progress in the last round.Separately, Germany’s ambassador to India Philipp Ackermann told TOI last week the 13th round was good but not good enough, while expressing confidence that India and the EU will get down to closing more chapters in the next round. Before the 13th round, only 12 of the 24 chapters, including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - had been closed.“The 13th round earlier in September was a bit of a missed opportunity to make some breakthrough. The EU was and is still ready to conclude on a meaningful package. We look forward to India engaging in earnest and moving, like the EU has shown readiness to do, towards a mutually beneficial deal,” said Delphin, addressing an event that explored the way forward in India-EU relations against the backdrop of global disorder.Delphin said that the EU and India offer each other important strategic options to “de-risk the economic turmoil and the security uncertainties, to tap into our complementarities and combine respective strengths and scale to serve each other’s interests”.The EU push towards strategic autonomy and India’s own, as Delphin said, strategic conundrum in the form of challenges posed by the US, China and Russia have forced both sides to diversify their partnerships. However, India’s energy ties with Russia, as EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said this month, remains an impediment to progress in India-EU ties. On its part, India wants EU to shun “double standards” on the issue of Russian oil, with the MEA reminding the EU last week of President Donald Trump’s remarks urging Europe to not purchase Russian energy.Delphin said it is for India to consider how it can square its position on Russia, a strategic partner, with its support for peace and its desire to enhance ties with the EU. Apart from its energy ties with Russia, India’s participation in the Russia-Belarus military exercise Zapad-2025 has also been met with disapproval in Europe.“We also have to be clear-eyed about those issues on which we are not aligned...there is a Russia question - specifically linked to its war of aggression against Ukraine and its hostile attitude towards as seen in past weeks and days and the violation of European air space by Russian drones,” said Delphin.“India has pronounced itself for peace. Russia is a strategic partner for India. And India wants to deepen its ties with the EU. This will require further consideration in Delhi on how to square those terms,” he added.","The 13th round of india-eu negotiations for a free trade agreement (fta) this month was a missed opportunity, says eu ambassador to india herve delphin.

Paul Finebaum recalls ESPN ‘killed’ his White House plan

“They told me we were not allowed to mix politics with sports,” Finebaum said. “I was devastated. It wasn’t about politics; it was about the game.”

“It was a turning point for me. Just the idea of going to the White House to interview the President of the United States. I never exactly knew where the kill button came from, but it didn’t happen.”

Paul Finebaum weighs Senate run after Charlie Kirk assassination

“It was an awakening,” h

. “I spent four hours numb talking about things that didn’t matter to me.”

Paul Finebaum, the longtime ESPN college football voice, says the network blocked him from interviewing President Donald Trump in 2019. Finebaum revealed this during a recent talk with Clay Travis on OutKick. He shared that a friend in Washington, D.C. had set up the idea before the big LSU vs Alabama football game on November 9, 2019, which Trump attended. Finebaum was ready to travel from New York to the White House for the interview, but ESPN shut it down. Now at 70, the Alabama native is also thinking about running for the United States Senate.Finebaum said the chance came in late 2019 when Trump planned to attend the LSU–Alabama clash, one of the biggest games of the decade. His Washington contact asked if he would want the President on his ESPN show. Finebaum agreed and prepared to travel to the White House. But after calling his bosses, he says ESPN “killed it.”He explained that the network had strict rules on avoiding politics. Finebaum added,This moment, he said, stayed with him for years. He admitted that while ESPN has policies, he felt the situation was special because it was about a game the President was attending.In the same OutKick interview, Finebaum also said he is now considering a Senate run in Alabama. The seat will be open in 2026, as current Senator Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach, is running for governor.

Why Donald Trump called Wayne Gretzky a “free agent” and why it stirred debate in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-donald-trump-called-wayne-gretzky-a-free-agent-and-why-it-stirred-debate-in-canada/articleshow/124227046.cms,"Wayne Gretzky & Donald Trump (Getty Images)

Donald Trump’s unusual remark about Gretzky sparks questions



Wayne Gretzky’s careful image and the risk of political entanglement



When Wayne Gretzky retired from hockey in 1999, few could have imagined his name would resurface years later in the middle of political controversy. But in February 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump made headlines after referring to the Canadian hockey legend as a “free agent. ” The comment, posted on Donald Trump ’s social media platform, wasn’t about Gretzky lacing up skates again, it was about politics, friendship, and public perception.Donald Trump’s post came after Wayne Gretzky was spotted at his inauguration earlier that year. Trump wrote that he didn’t want Canadians to “turn against Gretzky” because of their personal friendship. He then added that the Great One was a “free agent,” a phrase usually reserved for athletes switching teams. Coming from Trump, the choice of words immediately fueled speculation—was it a joke, a political signal, or an attempt to align Gretzky with his own brand?For Canadians, Gretzky has long stood as more than just a sports hero. His image is tied to national pride, hockey history, and cultural identity. That’s why Donald Trump’s framing of Gretzky as someone up for grabs unsettled some observers, especially at a time when U.S. politics often spills over the border. The idea that Gretzky might be drawn into partisan narratives raised concerns that his carefully neutral public persona could be compromised.Throughout his career and retirement, Gretzky has avoided political drama, focusing instead on business ventures, family, and contributions to the game of hockey.His decision to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration was personal, but the optics made it appear political. For many Canadians, that blurred line felt uncomfortable.Donald Trump’s remark also tapped into a broader debate about celebrity endorsements and the risks athletes face when their names are tied to divisive figures. Unlike players who openly campaign or endorse candidates, Gretzky has rarely taken political stances. Being labeled a “free agent” in this context suggested he could be “claimed” by a side, whether he wanted that or not.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s final game-worn Rangers jersey heads to auction with massive fan interest In the end, the episode became a reminder of how iconic figures like Gretzky carry symbolic weight far beyond their sport.
