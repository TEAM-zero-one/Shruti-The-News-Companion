Oil strategy guided by national interest: Foreign secretary Vikram Misri,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/oil-strategy-guided-by-national-interest-foreign-secretary-vikram-misri/articleshow/128131058.cms,"Indian cos assess oil availability, risks and costs, says Misri

NEW DELHI: The government on Monday said that India's oil sourcing strategy will be guided by national interest and it will not depend on any single country for its needs, while highlighting that actual purchases are done by petroleum companies, with decisions dependent on market conditions, availability, pricing and risk assessment.The comments by foreign secretary Vikram Misri came three days after US President Donald Trump's executive order lifting the 25% penal tariff on India said the country had committed to stop purchasing Russian oil, either directly or indirectly. Amid the suspense over India's position on already-declining Russian oil imports, Misri said oil companies, public or private, will continue to make business choices driven by the considerations he outlined - a complex matrix of issues, including the important financial and logistical aspects.His response followed repeated remarks by commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal that only the foreign ministry could comment on whether India gave any such commitment to the US while arriving at the framework for an interim trade agreement, and accusations by opposition that govt was evading the question.Misri said, “What I can firmly and confidently say is that whether it is govt or indeed our business, at the end of the day, national interests will be the guiding factor for us in our choices.”He was replying to a question on the issue at a media briefing on the visit of Seychelles President Patrick Herminie.In Dec, India’s crude imports from Russia fell to a 10-month low of $2.7 billion, down 15% from Dec 2024, while Saudi Arabia (60% rise to $1.8 billion) and the US (31% increase to $569 million) were the big gainers. Russia, however, remained the largest source, accounting for 31% of imports during April-Dec 2025, as against a little under 37.5% a year ago, commerce department data showed. During this period, the US’s share has jumped from 4.5% to 7.8%.“They (oil companies) assess availability at any given point in time, and they assess risks, costs in this process. And obviously, all of these companies also have their own internal accountability-related processes to look at and certain fiduciary responsibilities in the market,” said Misri. He added that govt’s foremost priority is to safeguard the interests of Indian consumers and ensure they receive adequate energy at the right price and through reliable and secure supplies.Misri also said India seeks to maintain multiple sources of supply and diversify them as appropriate to ensure stability. “I would say that the more diversified we are in this area, the more secure we are,” said Misri. India and many other countries share a common interest in ensuring stable prices and secure supplies at a time when global uncertainties are impacting the stability of energy markets, he said.He noted India was not just one of the largest consumers of energy but also helped stabilise global energy markets. “That’s one reason we import energy from multiple sources... the key drivers of our energy policy are adequate availability, fair pricing and reliability of supply. We import crude oil from dozens of nations. We are neither dependent on any single source for this, nor do we intend to be.”","Indian cos assess oil availability, risks and costs, says vikram misri.

HYDERABAD: At a time when a knife attack that left four Indian students injured in Russia has put the spotlight on the challenges faced by them in the country, latest external affairs ministry data shows that over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by Indian students globally originate from Russia, with Moscow emerging as the biggest hotspot.As per the data, Indian students across 196 countries registered around 350 complaints of exploitation, harassment and racial discrimination in 2025. Of these, more than 200 came from Russia alone.What has raised serious concern is the steep rise in such cases over the past three years - from 68 complaints in 2023 to 78 in 2024, before surging to 201 in 2025. The majority of Indian medical students in Russia belong to states such as Rajasthan , Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh , Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While Russia remains one of the most popular destinations for Indian students, particularly those pursuing medical education, due to relatively lower tuition fees and easier admission processes, the sharp increase in complaints has triggered serious safety concerns.Students in Russia whom TOI spoke to said they are routinely discriminated against by students from other countries, with some even alleging mental harassment by universities themselves, including threats of expulsion over minor issues or violations. They said many of their grievances never reach official channels due to fear of retaliation from varsities or complications related to visas and immigration.""During my sixth year, a group of foreign students attacked Indian students in the hostel kitchen over a minor argument and threatened them with a knife,"" said Kanishka K, a graduate from Bashkir State Medical University, Moscow. He reiterated that ""many such incidents are never reported because students are scared of being targeted or expelled"".Members of Foreign Medical Graduates associations admitted to widespread racial profiling, verbal abuse and a lack of institutional support for Indian students in Russia. ""Complaints are rarely taken seriously. Students suffer in silence as universities often sideline them,"" said D Kaushal, coordinator of All FMGs.He further claimed that while Russian regulations limit foreign intake to around 200 students per institution, some universities admit over 1,200 students and later expel them, sometimes even in sixth year, in violation of norms. ""Such expulsions leave students in severe financial and psychological distress,"" he said.Owing to the deteriorating situation, FMGs say many Indian students are now opting for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan instead. ""The number of Indian students choosing Russia has declined significantly, by at least 50%, in recent years due to these issues. Moreover, since the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, Indian students have shown declining interest in pursuing MBBS in Russia because of safety concerns and academic uncertainty,"" said Manoj Kumar, president of the FMGs Association of India.Meanwhile, replying to a recent LS query on Indian workers and students facing exploitation, detention, wage denial and racial discrimination abroad, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said dedicated officers have been posted in Indian missions and posts overseas to handle education and student welfare-related matters.""Our missions maintain regular contact with Indian students enrolled abroad and brief them on challenges and threats, if any, that they may confront during their stay there. Heads of missions and senior embassy officers visit foreign educational institutions in their respective countries of accreditation to interact with Indian students and students' associations,"" he said.","Over 50% of all complaints of exploitation and racial discrimination reported by indian students globally originate from russia.

NEW DELHI: Iran’s ambassador to India, Mohammad Fathali, on Monday described the Chabahar Port project as a symbol of the strong partnership between India and Iran, saying it plays a crucial role in promoting common development and regional connectivity.Speaking at a reception hosted by the Iranian Embassy in India to mark Iranian National Day, Ambassador Fathali said ties between the two countries are deeply rooted in thousands of years of shared history and civilisation.He underlined that this long-standing cultural connection provides a strong foundation for expanding bilateral cooperation.“Relations between Iran and India are rooted in thousands of years of shared history and civilisation and based on common culture,” the envoy said, as per news agency ANI.“This rich heritage is a valuable asset for expanding bilateral cooperation. The Chabahar Port project, as a symbol of the cooperation between our two countries, plays an important role in the common development and regional connectivity,” he added.Secretary (West) in the ministry of external affairs, Sibi George, represented India as the Chief Guest at the reception.

Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Likely To Face No-Confidence Motion After Naravane Memoir Row

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Monday registered an FIR over the circulation of an unpublished book of ex-Chief of Army Staff General Naravane on social media, cops told news agency PTI.A row erupted over General Naravane’s book after Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi cited excerpts from the former Army chief’s unpublished memoir and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""not fulfilling responsibility"" during the 2020 India-China military clashes in Ladakh.Speaking to reporters outside the Parliament the Congress leader said, “The speaker is saying that this book does not exist, Rajnath ji has said this book does not exist. This is Naravane ji's book wherein he has written the account of Ladakh...Narendra Modi ji did not fulfil his responsibility.”Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be-published Naravane's book shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Meanwhile, Penguin Random House, which holds the publishing rights, said the book has ""not gone into publication. No copies of the book - in print or digital form - have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public"" by them.""In light of recent public discourse and media reporting, Penguin Random House India would like to clarify that we hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny, a memoir by General Manoj Mukund Naravane, former Chief of the Indian Army. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies of the book - in print or digital form - have been published, distributed, sold, or otherwise made available to the public by Penguin Random House India,"" the publishing house wrote on X.There has been no official word from the author or even the ministry on the status of the book.Senior military officials, particularly those dealing with classified information, are subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act that restrict the publication of books or information even after retirement to prevent such classified material from becoming public.While a general one-year “cooling-off” period exists for taking up commercial or private employment, regulations for publishing secret content require prior government clearance.""Four Stars of Destiny"", a memoir of Naravane, who was Army chief from December 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, remains unpublished due to pending clearance from the defence ministry regarding sensitive details on the 2020 Line of Actual Control (LAC) standoff and Agnipath scheme.If the said rules and regulations are violated, the government can take legal action and such violations can also lead to the withholding of part or all of the pension of the military official concerned, as per CCS (Pension) Rules. There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas. As of today, the situation along LAC is characterised by a “thaw” following a series of disengagement agreements, yet high-level military forward deployment from both sides persists.","Unpublished book of ex-army chief mm naravane sparks row.

NEW DELHI: The Opposition is preparing to move a no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, with senior Congress leader K C Venugopal on Monday hinting at imminent action amid allegations that Opposition voices are being stifled in the House.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament complex, Venugopal criticised the functioning of the Lok Sabha and said the leader of the opposition was not being allowed to speak on key issues. “As per the Parliamentary rules, the Leader of Opposition is a shadow Prime Minister. But here, the LoP is not being allowed to speak in the House.

This kind of attitude against the opposition never happened before... wait for the action,” the Congress MP from Kerala said.He further alleged that the Leader of the Opposition was prevented from raising concerns over the proposed trade agreement with the United States.“The government wants to preserve the Parliament for itself,” Venugopal said.Referring to the trade deal, he added, “US-India trade deal was somewhat shocking and the Leader of Opposition wants to mention a few things about it to the Speaker, but that was also not allowed. The government wants to preserve the Parliament for itself.”The remarks come amid Opposition claims that Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi was repeatedly denied the opportunity to speak during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.Backing a collective Opposition stand, Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav said all parties would abide by the decision of the INDIA alliance leadership on the proposed no-confidence motion. “Whatever decision the senior leaders of the INDIA alliance take, all Opposition parties will stick to it,” she told reporters.According to sources, deliberations on the no-confidence motion were held at a meeting chaired earlier in the day by Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.","The opposition is preparing to move a no-confidence motion against lok sabha speaker om birla.

I would like the SIT report released.CM is not Chanakya.”Commenting on the timing of Sarma’s press conference, Gogoi said, “The main fact behind yesterday's long press conference is the Congress party's rising popularity... If it were a matter of national security, why was he sitting idle for the last six months?..

He also alleged that Gogoi undertook a “very confidential” visit to Pakistan in 2013 and was believed to have undergone “some kind of training,” daring the Congress leader to come clean on the trip or face charges of “rashtra-droh” (treason).Sarma further claimed that Colburn had worked with LEAD Pakistan, an organisation run by Sheikh, before transferring to India, and that she continued to receive salary from Sheikh, allegedly bypassing Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) rules.He said that after working in India, she gathered information and provided reports to Sheikh, and that Gogoi had failed to declare her Pakistani bank account in his election affidavit.","Assam congress president gaurav gogoi refuted assam cm himanta biswa sarma’s claims linking him to pakistan.

'False, Baseless': Congress Women MPs Write To LS Speaker Om Birla, Reject Threat To PM Modi Charge

NEW DELHI: A group of women MPs from the Congress has written a strongly worded letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , accusing him of making “false and defamatory allegations” against them.The controversy erupted after Birla publicly stated that he had advised the Prime Minister not to come to the House because of fears that Congress MPs could create an “inappropriate incident” near the PM’s seat.In the three-page letter addressed to Birla, Congress MP S. Jothimani and other women MPs rejected the charge outright, calling it an attempt to deflect from what they described as the government’s refusal to allow the leader of the opposition to speak.“We write this letter with deep anguish and a strong sense of constitutional responsibility. It is extremely unfortunate that you, as the Hon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha, have been forced by the ruling party to make false, baseless, and defamatory allegations against women Members of Parliament belonging to the Opposition,” the letter states.""During the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address, established parliamentary convention mandates that both the ruling party and the opposition are allowed to speak, after which the Prime Minister replies.Yet, for the past four consecutive days, the leader of the opposition, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, has been deliberately denied this opportunity in the Lok Sabha. This is unprecedented and indefensible,"" it added.The letter further claimed that eight MPs from the INDIA alliance were suspended at the government’s behest, while a BJP MP was allowed to make “vulgar and obscene” remarks about former Prime Ministers without facing any consequences.The Congress MPs also accused the Speaker of acting on instructions from the government rather than exercising independent authority.“When we met you, we demanded justice and the suspension of the above-mentioned BJP MP, you acknowledged that a grave mistake had occurred and asked us to return at 4 pm. Upon meeting you again, you stated that you were awaiting the government’s response regarding the issue, indicating that you are no longer the decision maker in such matters. This raises serious questions regarding your authority as Speaker of the House,” the letter said.The MPs described Birla’s allegation that they had “gheraoed” the Prime Minister as an assault on their dignity and credibility.""We are being targeted simply because we have consistently fought against Prime Minister Narender Modi's anti-people government and demanded accountability from him. His abscence from the House was not due to any thrcat from us, it was an act of fear. He did not have the courage to face the opposition,"" it added.The letter follows a statement by Speaker Om Birla explaining why the Prime Minister’s scheduled reply in the Lok Sabha was cancelled, a charge the Congress has rejected.“When the Prime Minister was supposed to respond to the President’s address in the House, I received information that several Congress MPs could have created an inappropriate incident near the Prime Minister’s chair… If such an incident had occurred, it would have torn apart the democratic traditions of the country. To prevent this, I requested the Prime Minister not to come to the House,” Birla said.","Lok sabha speaker om birla accused of making 'false and defamatory allegations' against congress women mps.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The gulf cooperation council is moving forward with a long-planned unified tourist visa that could transform travel across the gulf region.

(AI image)



Gold, Silver Prices Today: Top 10 Things To Know

In global commodity markets, gold prices were around the $5,000-an-ounce mark. Prices climbed up to 1.7% on Monday, recovering nearly half of the losses incurred after retreating sharply from the record high recorded on January 29. Silver continued to display greater volatility, with price movements intensified by speculative activity and relatively limited over-the-counter trading volumes. After dropping by more than one-third from its peak level, the metal gained as much as 5% on Monday, moving back above $80 per ounce. According to Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart, gold is likely to maintain support near $4,555 per troy ounce on a closing basis, while silver could hold above $65 per troy ounce. On the MCX, he estimates gold support at Rs 1,54,000–Rs 1,51,800 and resistance at Rs 1,57,700–Rs 1,60,000. Jain advises accumulating gold within the 154,000–152,000 band, keeping a stop loss below 150,500, with upside targets of 156,800–159,000. For silver, he suggests buying in the 250,000–244,000 range, placing a stop loss below 236,600, and aiming for targets of 2,55,500–2,62,000 and 2,65,500. Market analysts are of the view that the recent sharp surge in silver prices was not primarily driven by industrial demand. Instead, it was largely fuelled by speculative buying, as investors rushed in amid fears of missing further gains. A report by Mirae Asset Mutual Fund noted that while the rally initially rested on familiar and previously credible themes, silver eventually moved well beyond its underlying fundamentals. For years, silver has remained in gold’s shadow, with gold continuing to dominate as the preferred safe-haven during periods of geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over weakening fiat currencies. Both investors and central banks largely favoured gold during such phases. According to Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, the decline in the US dollar and growing doubts surrounding its long-term reserve currency role have been key factors supporting gold’s ongoing rally. Why did gold, silver prices crash in the last few days? The steep rally in recent months encouraged investors to book profits in both metals, adding to the downward pressure on prices. Multiple factors have been linked to the recent sharp correction seen in both gold and silver. The immediate trigger was US President Donald Trump’s backing of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his preferred choice to replace current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Markets view Warsh as a policy hawk inclined toward stricter control over inflation and tighter monetary policy. The dollar strengthened against major global currencies, reducing the appeal of such assets and weakening the dollar-debasement narrative.

A quick exit after the final whistle

What is the “Super Bowl effect”?

Super Bowl Ads 2026: So Much AI!

Super Bowl LX was not just a massive sporting event inside Levi’s Stadium, it also turned into one of the busiest nights of the year in the skies above Northern California. As the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their win over the New England Patriots, another kind of movement was already underway.Within minutes of the final whistle, hundreds of private jets began preparing for departure, creating a dramatic late-night air traffic rush across the Bay Area. Aviation experts described it as one of the largest private flight surges linked to a single event in 2026, showing how the Super Bowl has grown into a global spectacle that stretches far beyond football.As soon as the game ended, private planes began taking off from nearby airports. Within just a few hours, many business jets had already left. Airports like San Jose Mineta International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport were extremely busy.Reports show that dozens of private jets departed almost at the same time. The rush started shortly after the confetti fell at the stadium. Many wealthy fans, celebrities, business leaders and VIP guests did not wait long before heading home.Some well-known names were Kim Kardashian, who’s private jet reportedly flew back to Los Angeles soon after the game. Jay-Z and Beyoncé were also said to have left the area not long after the final whistle. Popular destinations included Los Angeles and Las Vegas.This huge movement of private jets is often called the “Super Bowl effect.” Every year, the NFL’s biggest game brings a sharp rise in private flights. Wealthy guests prefer flying private because it is faster, more comfortable and avoids busy airport crowds.According to flight tracking data, private jet departures were much higher than a normal weekend. Some reports suggest departures were more than ten times higher than usual in certain hours after the game. Airports in the Bay Area prepared in advance for the heavy traffic. Extra planning, parking arrangements and flight schedules were put in place to handle the large number of aircraft safely.The Super Bowl has become much more than a sports event. It is now a major entertainment and business gathering. Ticket prices are extremely high, and many guests choose private travel for convenience. Private jet operators often charge high fees during Super Bowl week. Parking fees and special landing slots can cost thousands of dollars. Despite the high prices, demand remains strong.","The super bowl turned into one of the busiest nights of the year in the skies above northern california.

What are the odds?

What a Mahmood premiership would represent

Who Shabana Mahmood actually is

Why she could win, and why she might not

The larger irony





British prime ministers are rarely undone by what they say. More often, they are undone by what they fail to anticipate.Keir Starmer is under mounting pressure not because of any personal wrongdoing, but because of a political misjudgement that has landed at precisely the wrong moment: the decision to bring Peter Mandelson back into the heart of Labour’s power structure just as the Epstein Files resurfaced in public consciousness.Starmer is not accused of misconduct, and Mandelson has consistently denied any impropriety. Yet British politics does not operate solely on legal thresholds. It operates on perception, timing and instinct. The renewed attention on Epstein has revived a broader unease about elite networks, proximity to power and the sense that some figures are insulated from consequences. In that climate, Mandelson’s return has become a liability rather than an asset, raising uncomfortable questions not about guilt, but about judgement.What has unsettled Labour MPs is not the substance of any allegation, but the feeling that Starmer failed to grasp how unforgiving the political moment had become. His response has been procedural and defensive, when the moment demanded moral distance and political clarity. Once a leader’s judgement is questioned, authority begins to thin out rapidly in Westminster.That is why the survival of Starmer’s premiership, once assumed, is now openly discussed as conditional.Peter Mandelson is not merely a former minister or adviser. He is the embodiment of Labour’s New Labour era, a survivor of past scandals and a symbol of a governing class that many voters now view with suspicion. By relying on Mandelson’s experience, Starmer was signalling competence and seriousness. Instead, he has inherited the baggage of an era increasingly seen as detached from public anger about privilege and access.The Epstein Files have intensified that discomfort. Even without direct accusations, Mandelson’s name has become shorthand for elite proximity, and Starmer’s inability to foresee the backlash has exposed him to criticism from within his own party. The question Labour MPs are quietly asking is no longer about Mandelson’s conduct, but about Starmer’s political instincts.In British politics, that is often the beginning of the end.Labour’s leadership rules are designed to protect incumbents, but they cannot protect leaders who lose the confidence of their parliamentary party. If Starmer were to resign or be forced out, the transition would be swift and pragmatic. Governments do not pause to reflect when authority collapses; they move to stabilise.That has brought renewed attention to a small group of senior figures seen as immediately viable. Among them are Angela Rayner, Wes Streeting, and increasingly, Shabana Mahmood.This is no longer just media speculation. Betting markets and prediction platforms have begun pricing the scenario with a degree of seriousness. Mahmood is not viewed as the frontrunner, but she is consistently placed in the second tier of contenders, with bookmakers offering odds broadly in the 7/1 to 12/1 range, while prediction markets assign her a high single-digit probability of becoming prime minister. These figures are not endorsements, but they reflect plausibility. Bookmakers respond to structure, not symbolism.In current markets on who could replace Keir Starmer, Shabana Mahmood is positioned as a credible second-tier contender rather than a long shot. On Polymarket, she is trading at roughly an 8% implied probability, well behind Angela Rayner, who sits in the low-20s, and Wes Streeting, who is typically in the high-teens. Traditional bookmakers broadly reflect the same hierarchy. Bet365, William Hill, Ladbrokes, and Paddy Power have all priced Mahmood in a band ranging from 7/1 to 12/1 in recent snapshots, compared with shorter odds for Rayner and Streeting and significantly longer prices for more speculative names. That placement puts Mahmood squarely between the frontrunners and the outsiders, signalling that markets see a plausible route to the leadership, even if they do not yet see her as the most likely outcome.If Shabana Mahmood were to become prime minister, Britain would have its first Muslim prime minister. It would be an undeniable historical milestone, but one that would arrive quietly rather than triumphantly.Mahmood has never framed her politics around identity mobilisation. She does not campaign as a symbol, and she has shown little interest in cultural signalling. Her appeal, such as it is, rests on competence, seniority and institutional trust. Any history made would be the by-product of parliamentary arithmetic rather than ideological intent.As Home Secretary, Mahmood holds one of the four great offices of state and arguably the most politically punishing department in government. The Home Office tests authority daily, demanding decisions on borders, policing, national security and public order. It is a role that rewards control and punishes misjudgement.An MP since 2010 for Birmingham Ladywood, Mahmood has built a reputation as a serious, detail-oriented administrator. She is not a natural showrunner in the media age, nor does she chase rhetorical spectacle. Within government, she is regarded as methodical, cautious and tough-minded.Her politics align closely with Labour’s governing instinct rather than its activist impulse. On immigration and settlement, she has supported firmer frameworks tied to conduct and contribution. On policing and protest, she has emphasised public order and the cumulative impact of disruption. On security and technology, she has shown comfort with an expanded, modernised state capacity.This positioning has made her broadly acceptable across Labour’s internal spectrum. She may not inspire fervour, but she commands a degree of trust, which in moments of crisis can matter more than charisma.Mahmood’s case rests on stability. She is senior, scandal-free and already managing one of the most demanding departments in government. In a post-Mandelson moment, where Labour would need to demonstrate seriousness and distance from elite complacency, her low-drama profile could become an asset.Yet leadership contests are rarely decided on competence alone. They are shaped by internal alliances, momentum and narrative control. Mahmood does not yet possess an obvious factional machine, and her caution, which has served her well in office, may limit her reach in a fast-moving contest.Above all, this future remains hypothetical. Keir Starmer is still prime minister, and until that changes, every succession scenario remains provisional.If the Epstein fallout and the Mandelson miscalculation were to end Starmer’s premiership, and if that collapse were to elevate ShabanaMahmood, British politics would complete a quiet historical loop.The same political system that once presided over the division of India and Pakistan along religious lines would, within a single decade, have produced a Hindu prime minister in Rishi Sunak and potentially a Muslim one as well.History, it turns out, has a sense of irony that imperial cartographers never planned for.","Keir starmer is under mounting pressure not because of any personal wrongdoing, but because of a political misjudgement. The decision to bring peter mandelson back into the heart of labour’s power structure just as the epstein files resurfaced in public consciousness.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128103820,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-100908,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
