PM Modi addresses the Plenary Session during the AI Action Summit in Paris, France

US Vice President JD Vance gave a shoutout to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s views on the role of artificial intelligence in economic growth at the AI Action Summit in Paris. The summit was co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron and PM Modi.Vance, representing the Trump administration, reiterated a commitment to a "" pro-worker growth path "" for AI, ensuring it serves as a tool for job creation in the United States. Acknowledging PM Modi’s stance that AI won't take away jobs, Vance said, “I appreciate Prime Minister Modi’s point. AI, I believe, will facilitate and make people more productive. It is not going to replace human beings. It will never replace human beings.”Further criticizing concerns within the AI industry about mass job displacement, Vance argued that such fears overlook AI’s true potential. “Too many leaders in the AI industry, when they talk about this fear of replacing workers, miss the point. AI, we believe, is going to make us more productive, more prosperous, and more free,” he asserted.Meanwhile, PM Modi, in his address at the summit before Vance, called for an unbiased and democratic artificial intelligence. ""We must develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency. We must build quality data sets free from biases,"" he said. Further talking about concerns around loss of jobs, PM added, ""Loss of jobs is AI’s most feared disruption. But, history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology.

Delhi University on Tuesday argued in the Delhi High Court that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BA degree did not fall under ""public interest"" under the Right to Information Act while defending its refusal to share the document.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing DU, told Justice Sachin Datta that something of ""interest to the public"" was not the same as ""public interest"".""Mere curiosity that 'I want to know about it what is your objection' cannot be an argument. The public may get interested in something but it may not be public interest..Is there any public interest in this matter? The answer in the facts of this case is no,"" news agency PTI reported Mehta as saying.Senior counsel Sanjay Hegde, representing the RTI applicant before the court, defended the order, arguing that an educational institution does not hold a student’s marks in a fiduciary capacity.The Central Information Commission on December 21, 2016, ordered the inspection of records of all students who cleared the BA exam in 1978 -- the year Prime Minister Modi also passed it.The CIC, in its order, asked DU to allow inspection and rejected the argument of its public information officer that it was third-party personal information, observing there was ""neither merit nor legality"" in it.The University challenged the order calling it ""arbitrary"" and ""untenable in law"" and that the information sought to be disclosed was ""third-party personal information"". Following this, the high court stayed the CIC order on January 23, 2017.The next hearing is on February 19.","The central information commission ordered inspection of records of all students who cleared the ba exam in 1978 -- the year prime minister modi also passed it.

Donald Trump pauses US foreign bribery law; relief for Adani Group?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/donald-trump-pauses-us-foreign-bribery-law-relief-for-adani-group/articleshow/118158253.cms,"Adani stocks took $55 billion hit after indictment

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), that prohibits US companies from bribing foreign government officials to get or retain business contracts.The move could potentially bring relief to Adani Group, which was indicted by the department of justice (DoJ) and US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) last year. The order signed by Trump directs attorney general Pam Bondi to pause FCPA actions until revised FCPA enforcement guidance is issued, which ""promotes American competitiveness and efficient use of federal law enforcement resources"".The order said past and existing FCPA actions will be reviewed and future FCPA actions must be approved by the attorney general. TNNThe order addresses a long-held grievance of the American business that the anti-bribery law leaves them hamstrung vis-a-vis their competitors who don't have to contend with similar restraint.The action taken by the US DoJ against billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew, former executives of Canadian pension fund CDPQ and Azure Power for their alleged role in a $265 million bribery case to secure solar power supply contracts in India, was termed by some quarters as arising out of the FCPA.The case stoked a massive controversy and led to a significant slide in the group company shares, which have since recovered sharply. The Adani Group had said since the indictment, it had suffered a loss of nearly $55 billion in its market capitalisation across its 11 listed companies. However, in late November, Adani Green Energy Ltd had informed the stock exchanges and clarified that Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain had not been charged with any violation of the FCPA on the counts mentioned in the criminal indictment of the US DoJ or the civil complaint of the US-SEC.In a significant coincidence, a group of six US Congressmen have written to newly appointed attorney general Bondi, calling for a review of what they said were ""some questionable decisions"" made by the DoJ under the Biden administration, and cited the case against Adani group.""One such decision involves the questionable pursuit of a case against the Adani group, an Indian company whose executives are situated in India. The case rests on the allegation that preparations were made by members of this company in India to bribe Indian officials, also exclusively located in India,"" said the letter signed by Lance Gooden, Mat Fallon, Mark Haridopolos, Brandon Gill, William R Timmons and Brian Babin.The letter endorses the grouse of the Adani Group that they were targeted for extraneous considerations and that the DOJ under the Biden administration overplayed its hand. ""Instead of deferring the case to appropriate Indian authorities, the Biden DoJ pushed forward and indicted the company's executives without any real injury to the US interests being present,"" said the February 10 letter to Bondi. The Congressmen said there was no compelling reason to pursue a case in a manner that could complicate relations with an ally like India unless some external factors were at play. They said some of these decisions involved pursuing and abandoning cases, often against America's interest at home and abroad, jeopardising relationships with close allies like India.On Tuesday, the stocks of Adani group companies had a mixed day despite the broader market witnessing strong selling pressure since the start of the session due to weak global cues. After an initial euphoria about news related to the pausing of the FCPA in the US, the rally across the 11 group stocks fizzled out and only two stocks, group flagship Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, closed higher.The FCPA of 1977 was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business, according to the DoJ definition. Initially, the US business, reeling under the embarrassment of the Lockheed bribery scam where the American aviation major was accused of bribing the Japanese government for a hefty order, had welcomed the law, saying it would help them with their business. Originally, it applied to only Americans and certain foreign issuers of securities before it was expanded during the Clinton presidency to apply to foreign firms which do business with the US.The admiration turned to the disappointment and complaint that it had tied their hands against competition and tilted the field in latter's favour. Trump had promised to change the law in his first term. His order completes what was an important unfinished business.""It was a Jimmy Carter concept, and it sounds so good, but it's so bad. It hurts the country and many, many deals are unable to be made because nobody wants to do business,"" Trump said, dumping on a recently passed former president whom he disdained, having also blamed him for ceding the Panama Canal to Panama.","Us president donald trump signed an executive order pausing enforcement of a 48-year-old law, foreign corrupt practices act.

BENGALURU: Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has said his confidence in defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) continues to erode over its failure to fix delays in delivery and upgrades to the light combat aircraft Tejas.""You have to alleviate (our) worries and make us more confident. At the mom-ent, I am just not confident of HAL, which is a very wrong thing to happen,"" Singh said in a video shot on Monday, coinciding with the start of Aero India 2025 in Bengaluru. ""I can tell you (HAL) what our requirements and worries are,"" he can be heard saying, purportedly referring to the PSU. His remarks questioning the PSU's efficiency have stirred a row.Although this isn't the first time the IAF chief has slammed HAL over not adhering to timelines, his remarks questioning the defence PSU's efficiency have stirred controversy. HAL has attributed the delays to sanctions clamped on India after the 1998 nuclear tests. CMD D K Sunil said the PSU would catch up with the timelines set for the project, initiated in 1984, and the additional orders it is anticipating.HAL, which came in for criticism from previous IAF chiefs too, said Tuesday it was confident of ""delivering at least 11 Tejas-Mk1A aircraft to IAF by March-end"". This is part of an 83-aircraft contract. Multiple people associated with the project have hinted that HAL views the aircraft as being the Aeronautical Development Agency's baby. The argument is that the latter designed and developed the fighter while HAL began working only after a push for Make-in-India post-2014.On how the HAL leadership viewed repeated criticism from the air chief, Sunil said, ""I have to put it in context. You know that we (India) faced sanctions after our nuclear test in 1998, so we had to build things from the ground up. A lot of work has gone into it. The delays are not simply attributable to, you know, laziness."" He said technical issues had been resolved. ""The concern of the air chief is understandable as his squadron strength is reducing. We have promised that we will have all these structures ready. And we have conveyed this during multiple meetings at different levels,"" the CMD said.He said HAL was pushing American firm GE to consider an 80% transfer of technology (ToT) deal for the GE-414 engine that will power the upgraded variants of the Tejas, and probably India's fifth-generation aircraft AMCA, which is under development.Sunil said HAL had seen significant growth in its order book, which stands at more than Rs 1.3 lakh crore as of Dec 2024, thanks to several major contracts in the past year, including orders for 12 Su-30MKI aircraft for IAF, 240 AL31FP engines, and multiple helicopter orders for various defence forces.","Indian air force chief air chief marshal ap singh has said his confidence in defence psu hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal) continues to erode.

As he underlined the positive potential of artificial intelligence and the unprecedented scale and speed of its development, PM Modi on Tuesday called for collective global efforts to establish governance and standards that uphold shared values, address risks, and build trust, given a deep inter-dependence across borders in the use of the technology.Addressing the AI Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, which he co-chaired with French President Emmanuel Macron, Modi said governance is not just about managing risks and rivalries but also about promoting innovation, and deploying it for the global good. He sought pooling together of resources and talent to develop open-source systems that enhance trust and transparency.""So, we must think deeply and discuss openly about innovation and governance,"" the PM said, adding that AI is very different from other technology milestones in human history. He announced that India will host the next AI summit.While India, Japan, China and Australia were among the 60-odd signatories, US and UK did not endorse the joint communique, again highlighting differences in approach.Vice-President J D Vance, who led the US delegation, said AI could be strangled by excessive regulation. In his address, the PM called for global AI partnership to be more inclusive of Global South and its priorities, concerns and needs even as he welcomed the decision to set up an AI Foundation and endorsed a leaders' declaration that focused on promoting inclusivity, sustainability, accessibility and ethics in the technology's uses.""Governance is also about ensuring access to all, especially in Global South. It is where the capacities are most lacking - be it compute power, talent, data, or financial resources,"" said Modi, as he spoke about the need to address biases as AI reshapes society, economy and security and even writes the codes for humanity in this century.Modi said AI can help transform millions of lives by improving health, education and agriculture. ""We must build quality datasets free from biases. We must democratise technology and create people-centric applications. We must address concerns related to cybersecurity, disinformation, and deepfakes. And we must also ensure that technology is rooted in local ecosystems for it to be effective and useful,"" he said.While talking about India's own development of AI applications for public good, the PM said that the world is at the dawn of the AI age that will shape the course of humanity.""Some people worry about machines becoming superior in intelligence to humans. But no one holds the key to our collective future and shared destiny other than us humans. That sense of responsibility must guide us,"" he said.Looking to allay fears of job losses that AI might cause, the PM said history has shown that work does not disappear due to technology and there's a need to invest in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future. Modi called for democratising technology and its people-centric applications so that achieving Sustainable Development Goals becomes a reality, according to a press statement. Highlighting India's success in building a digital public infrastructure for its 1.4 billion citizens based on open and accessible technology, Modi noted that India, considering its diversity, was building its own large language model for AI. ""He underlined that India was ready to share its experience to ensure that the benefits of AI reach everyone,"" said the statement.According to Modi, AI models must be efficient and sustainable in size, data needs and resource requirements. ""The human brain manages to compose poetry and design spaceships using less power than most lightbulbs,"" he said.","Pm bats for ai access to global south.

He will also join French President Emmanuel Macron at the Mazargues War Cemetery to honour Indian soldiers who fought in World War I.Marseille, home of Napoleon Bonaparte and legendary footballer Zinedine Zidane, which lends its name to the inspiring battle hymn 'La Marseille', holds historical significance for Hindu nationalists as the site of Savarkar's escape attempt on July 8, 1910. En route to India aboard the British ship Morea, he slipped through a porthole, swam ashore and briefly evaded capture before French authorities returned him to the British. His extradition sparked a diplomatic dispute, with France arguing the process violated international law. The controversy led to international legal debates over asylum and extradition, drawing attention to colonial legal frameworks and their influence on political prisoners.Savarkar was sentenced to life imprisonment in Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, enduring harsh punishment but continuing to inspire the independence movement through his writings.

When it becomes operational, ITER is hoped to be the first large-scale fusion reactor to produce more energy than is used to initiate its fusion reactions The collaborative scientific initiative aimed at revolutionising global energy systems, benefits from India, which is a key partner in this world-class project. India's nuclear power generation has nearly doubled from 4,780MW in 2014 to 8,180MW in 2024. Looking ahead, the country is targeting an ambitious 22,48MW by 2031-32. India is also leveraging atomic energy to drive innovation in other critical sectors. In agriculture, nuclear techniques have been instrumental in developing 70 mutagenic crop varieties. The healthcare sector has also benefitted from these advances, with the introduction of advanced isotopes for cancer treatment that offer more precise and effective therapy.The defence sector also has seen practical applications, such as the creation of cost-effective, lightweight bulletproof jackets.Moreover, India's abundant thorium reserves - comprising 21% of the global total - position the country as a potential important player in safer, more sustainable nuclear energy alternatives.Under the Nuclear Energy Mission for Viksit Bharat, the Union Budget 2025-26 has allocated 20,000 crore for the research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).

It will then be seen whether it is feasible or not,"" a source said. The Navy already has 12 P-8I aircraft, packed with multi-mode radars and advanced electro-optic sensors as well as Harpoon Block-II missiles, MK-54 lightweight torpedoes, rockets and depth charges. The Boeing-manufactured planes were inducted under two deals, together worth over $3.2 billion, inked in 2009 and 2016.While P-8Is are primarily meant for hunting and destroying enemy submarines and warships, India has also extensively used them to keep tabs on Chinese troops and infrastructure along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control since the military confrontation erupted in eastern Ladakh in April 2020.In May 2021, the US state department had notified its Congress about the proposed sale of the six P-8Is and related equipment worth $2.4 billion to India. The price offer, however, expired after India put the deal on hold. Now, if India goes ahead, the cost is bound to go up.The Navy, of course, will also get 15 of the 31 weaponised MQ-9B 'Predator' drones meant for long-range ""hunt and kill"" missions under the mega $3.4 billion contract inked with the US last Oct, with Army and IAF getting eight each.The US has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth over $25 billion just since 2007. But Trump is already pushing for more, and even called upon India to increase its procurement of US-origin weapon systems during a telephonic conversation with Modi on January 27.Apart from P-8Is, the US is hard-selling joint manufacture of the eight-wheeled Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles, in addition to the co-production of the General Electric F414-INS6 aero-engines in India for Tejas Mark-II fighters, as earlier reported by TOI.The US is also keen on IAF's long-standing project for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be manufactured in India with foreign collaboration at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore.US aviation major Lockheed Martin, in partnership with Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, is also a contender for IAF's medium transport aircraft project to acquire 80 planes to replace the old Soviet-origin AN-32 fleet.","India now seems to be reviving its case for the procurement of six more advanced p-8i long-range maritime patrol and submarine-hunting aircraft from the us.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129430.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","25% steel tariff won't hit india's shipments to the us.

It saw US President Donald Trump signing a memorandum that calls upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind sanction waivers, particularly those that provide Iran “any degree of economic or financial relief, including those related to Iran’s Chabahar port project”. The remarks - at an event to mark the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution of Iran – also came days before PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington on Thursday.""Regional connectivity has been an important pillar of India, Iran relations. The development of the Chabahar port in southeastern Iran reflects our joint vision for connectivity for mutual benefits,"" said MEA secretary (east) Jaideep Mazumdar, while describing the signing of the long-term contract for the development of Chabahar port in May last year as a significant milestone in India-Iran ties.The port has proven its strong potential. It has emerged as the connecting point for the region in delivering deliver humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid pandemic, added the official, while listing the amount of assistance delivered to Afghanistan through the port.India and Iran had in 2015 signed an MoU to facilitate India’s partnership in developing the port. Last year, the 2 sides signed a contract that will have India equipping and operating the Shahid Beheshti terminal of the port over the next 10 years. The port opens up opportunities for India in trade and commerce with Afghanistan and Central Asia, while providing an alternative and reliable access route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.As the Indian government maintains, the port’s location in Arabian Sea means it won’t be vulnerable to dangers posed by developments in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz. The previous Trump administration had in 2018 exempted Chabahar from US sanctions , acknowledging its role in facilitating reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.The memorandum also called upon the Secretary of State to modify or rescind existing sanctions waivers and cooperate with the Secretary of Treasury to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero. India has not been importing crude from Iran for many years now.""Our economic ties are growing in many fields.

Are the Mets planning to release Starling Marte to reduce the team's financial crunch?

Why the Mets NEED to Trade Starling Marte RIGHT NOW

“In other news, the Mets discussed trading Starling Marte to the Royals for righty reliever Hunter Harvey around the time of Winter Meetings, sources told Mets On SI. NYM was willing to pay down a portion of Marte's salary in the deal but it wound up going nowhere.”

The New York Mets created waves in the sports industry after signing the Dominican star Juan Soto for $765 million. The record-breaking contract not only brought the talented fielder to the front page of MLB but also created a huge financial crunch for the Mets.After re-signing Pete Alonso and roping in the list of other athletes in order to improvise the roster for the upcoming season, the Mets’ luxury tax payroll has reached around $324 million. According to the rumors, the monetary burden has diverted attention to Starling Marte .With Spring training just around the corner, the New York Mets are struggling with a monetary challenge. The luxury tax payroll has reached a staggering amount of $324 million, which is the second highest after the Dodgers.According to the rumor mill, the Mets are looking forward to releasing a few prominent faces in order to reduce their financial burden and all the fingers are pointing towards the 36-year-old center fielder Starling Marte. With increasing age, a $78 million salary spanning over four years, and around $20.75 million for the upcoming season, Marte might have become a burden for the Mets.Based on the rumors in the MLB world, this is not the first time the Mets are in talks to move Starling Marte. Back in December 2024, the Mets even discussed trading Marte for Hunter Harvey with the Kansas City Royals. Even though the Mets were ready to pay for the Dominican outfielder, the discussion was stalled.Based on an update by the Mets’ Pat Ragazzo on Sports Illustrated, there is a strong possibility that Starling Marte can be traded to the San Diego Padres . The Padres are looking forward to improving their fielding segment for the upcoming season. After Jurickson Profar was traded off to the Atlanta Braves, the Padres have a vacant spot for a starting left fielder in the team. Ragazzo posted on X-MLB trade analysts believe that the trade for Starling Marte for Wandy Peralta might benefit both major league teams. Reportedly, the Mets might consider paying a significant part for Starling Marte’s deal in return for the Padres pitcher.Despite being in his mid-30s, Starling Marte is still one of the most productive hitters in the MLB currently. His salary has become the talking point in the baseball fraternity with respect to the skyrocketing cost burden on the New York Mets.","The new york mets' luxury tax payroll has reached a staggering amount of $324 million.
