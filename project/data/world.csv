NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.","Modi also advanced the vision of ‘mahasagar’ ( mutual and holistic advancement for security and growth across regions) for the global south.

NEW DELHI: On the day he was awarded the highest civilian honour of Mauritius, Prime Minister Narendra Modi , alongside his Mauritian counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, jointly inaugurated the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Public Service and Innovation in Mauritius on Wednesday. This milestone marks another significant step in India’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a reliable development partner on the global stage.The institute, named in honour of the former Indian PM, underscores Vajpayee’s legacy of fostering strong India-Mauritius relations and symbolises the deepening ties between the two countries.A senior govt official emphasised that PM Modi has consistently championed India’s role as a reliable partner in global development, supporting a wide array of initiatives worldwide. These efforts span critical sectors such as infrastructure, healthcare, education, and connectivity. “The inauguration of this institute is a testament to that vision, aligning with India’s broader mission to contribute meaningfully to the Global South and the Indian Ocean Region,” the govt functionary said.The Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute was funded through a $4.7 million grant from India under a 2017 MoU.

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked a Rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `Ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (LLTRs) for the IAF, as part of the ongoing drive to strengthen indigenous military capabilities .The contract was inked with defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), in the presence of defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, for the LLTRs designed and developed by the Electronics & Radar Development Establishment of DRDO. This is the first time that the IAF will induct indigenous LLTRs instead of those imported from abroad.“The Ashwini LLTR is an active electronically scanned phased array radar based on state-of-the-art solid-state technology. The radar is capable of tracking aerial targets from high-speed fighters to slow-moving targets such as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or drones and helicopters,” a MoD official said.“The acquisition will significantly enhance IAF’s operational preparedness. The programme is a major step towards achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing by reducing dependency on foreign companies, besides acting as a catalyst for development of the country’s defence-industrial ecosystem,” he added.The IAF deploys a variety of ground-based radars, including LLTRs, as well as airborne sensors for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) capabilities along the borders with China and Pakistan.The force is also looking to induct specialized mountain radars to look deep into enemy territory along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control with China, which has upgraded all its air bases facing India and deployed an extensive network of radars and surface-to-air guided weapons since the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh erupted in April-May 2020.","The defence ministry on wednesday inked a rs 2,906 crore contract for procurement of 18 `ashwini’ low-level transportable radars (lltrs) for the iaf.

Poll What Is the Best Way to Ensure Safety on Public Transport? Better Monitoring & Surveillance Increased Security Measures

In the autumn of 2018, Punjab-bound Jaffar Express had narrowly escaped twin blasts after Baloch rebels attempted to blow up the passenger train using remote-controlled explosive devices. The devices had exploded when the train was about 200 feet away.Tuesday’s attack isn’t an isolated incident. The train often carries personnel of Pakistani forces from Quetta to Punjab and vice versa, making it a hot target for groups like Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan). In 2023, the train was attacked twice in two months and at the same spot.On Jan 19, at least 13 people were injured after a bomb blast derailed the train when it was passing through Bolan district, around 150 km away from Quetta. About a month later, another blast was reported on the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar, killing at least one passenger and injuring a dozen. In Nov last year, at least 26 persons were killed and over 40 were injured, including women and children, in an explosion at Quetta railway station.For over 20 years, BLA has been waging a low-intensity insurgency in Balochistan, relying on traditional guerrilla tactics. However, a significant shift is being witnessed since 2018 as the group has begun employing suicide attacks and planned operations.The first testament to this shift in strategy was seen in Aug 2018 when BLA attacked a bus carrying Chinese engineers. This marked the revival of BLA’s suicide bombing unit, Majeed Brigade, named after a BLA commander killed by Pak military in Quetta in 2010.Since the 2018 attack, BLA has carried out over a dozen major suicide bombings in areas like Gwadar, Karachi, Turbat, Bolan, sending the Pak govt in a tizzy.BLA has also launched an offensive against China-Pakistan Economic Corridor .Last Oct, the Majeed Brigade carried out a ‘suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device’ attack targeting a Chinese convoy of engineers and investors departing from Jinnah International Airport, Karachi. The explosion resulted in around 50 deaths, including Chinese nationals and their security personnel. Bombings at Darul Uloom Haqqania aka ‘University of Jihad’ and killings of clerics like Mufti Shah Mir are recent examples.In 2016, the military had established a “Special Security Division” to protect Chinese expansionist projects and target Baloch political and social activists. Mir was heading one of the death squads formed for this purpose. While BLA poses a significant challenge, it is not the only concern for the Pakistani govt. TTP has also escalated its offensive against Pakistan this year. Last week, over a dozen security personnel were killed in twin suicide bombing attacks at a military base in Bannu.","Tuesday’s attack isn’t an isolated incident.

"Air India clogged lavatories: Aging aircraft, old ducts, scaling in pipes and passenger behaviour lead to stink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aging-aircraft-old-ducts-scaling-in-pipes-and-passenger-behaviour-lead-to-stink/articleshow/118906475.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Clogged toilets are not new to Air India flights, but the legacy of the old govt-run airline has been flushed across to the new Tata Group-owned company, right in the middle of its modernisation and expansion spree.For years, cleanup crew of Air India’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels, plastic bags, underwear and even small pillows given on board.Just as the Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged, over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels and bladders for similar reasons.The dumping has gone on regardless of clear signage asking flyers not to throw anything in the commode as that could “clog the toilet and cause inconvenience to you and your fellow passengers”.As Air India’s legacy Boeing 777s, used for North America nonstops, age, the problem is worsening as the old ducts find it increasingly difficult to suck in whatever indiscreet passengers flush away. “These aircraft are very old. The lavatory ducts or suction pipes have got scaling due to which their available width has reduced. External particles like shawls, sheets or towels easily and immediately clog them up,” said an engineer who has spent decades maintaining aircraft. Aircraft toilets use a vacuum system to remove waste into a storage tank.According to Air India’s former executive director Jitender Bhargava, the airline got 21 of its 23 B777s between 2007 and 2010. The other two were inducted much later and are now used as dedicated long-haul VVIP planes operated by the Indian Air Force. The B787 Dreamliners, used on the Europe, Far East and Australia routes, came in a few years later, starting 2010, and are also getting old now.The problem of clogged toilets has shown up on both these long-haul planes in the airline’s fleet. Due to night curfew in Europe, Air India’s affected B777s have in the past returned to either India or North America after flying hours. An engineer explained, “A B777 has two waste tanks. If a duct leading from a lavatory gets clogged, it will affect only that particular lavatory. But if the duct close to the waste tank inlet gets clogged, it will affect all lavatories connected to it.”On AI 126 being forced to return to Chicago on March 5, Air India said in a statement on Monday, “Our teams found polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable. While not found on AI 126 of March 5, 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for.”Is this problem faced by airlines of other countries as well? TOI spoke to officials of multiple leading foreign airlines, who said they have only experienced this problem sporadically. This suggests passengers behave differently in an Indian carrier than when they are aboard a foreign airline.“This is a very, very rare occurrence that can happen anywhere. Sometimes, a couple of lavatories may become unserviceable. If detected before taking off from a place that is not our engineering base, we resort to denied boarding and proportionately reduce the number of passengers on that aircraft,” said an official with a foreign airline.Apart from educating passengers, aircraft maintenance engineers have a word of advice for Air India. “Small bottles are kept in lavatories by AI and almost all other global airlines operating medium to ultra-long hauls. However given the peculiar situation of AI, it will be better to have bigger fixed dispensers that can be refilled by crew as a lot of small bottles end up getting flushed. Ditto for dental hygiene kits but those have to be given,” said an engineer.Crew members say passengers ignore the waste bins, which are right there, below or beside the wash basin, and flush everything down the toilet instead. Toilets in the economy section are more prone to clogging simply because the passenger load is higher. “Given the impact on reputation for Air India, the management must take a call on whether pre-flight instructions by crew should also include what not to flush in the lavs,” said a crew member.","For years, cleanup crew of air india’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels.

LUCKNOW: Posters of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath at a rally in Kathmandu to welcome former Nepal king Gyanendra Bir Shah has created a flutter in the Himalayan country, though the ties of its erstwhile monarchy with Gorakhsh Peeth, headed by Yogi, is centuries old.The Shah dynasty , which ruled Nepal till monarchy was abolished in May 2008, calls itself Gorakhpanthi, or the follower of Guru Gorakhnath. Yogi was even called by the pro-monarchy group in 2015 to address a rally in Kathmandu, where he had made a strong pitch for reinstatement of Nepal’s ‘ Hindu nation ’ status.“Nepal has 82% Hindus, and a significant number of them revere Nath sect’s Guru Gorakhnath and his spiritual mentor, Guru Matseyndranath. For them, the Communist dispensation and China’s growing influence has not been conducive, leading to clamour for restoration of monarchy as well as Nepal’s status as a Hindu nation,” said a political analyst.Pradeep Bikram Rana, who claimed to have waved the Yogi poster at the Sunday rally, reached Gorakhpur on Tuesday. He claimed he was being persecuted by the authorities in Kathmandu, forcing him to flee. Rana admitted to idolising Yogi as a symbol of Hindu pride. “The connection between Nepal’s former ruling dynasty and Gorakhsh Peeth is very old,” says Dwarika Tiwari, who has been looking after the mutt’s administration since 1972. King Birendra, who was assassinated along with his entire family in 2001, shared a strong bond with Mahant Avaidyanath , Yogi’s guru.“Even today, when monarchy has ended in Nepal, an offering of Rs 10,000 during Makar Sankranti, Rs 5,000 on first king’s birthday and Rs 5,000 on Dussehra is sent by the royal family to Goraksh Peeth . The temple sends ‘prasad’ to the family through a representative every year,” Tiwari told TOI. “There is a legend that Guru Gorakhnath had blessed Prithvi Shah — considered the first king of modern Nepal — when he was a boy that his empire would flourish and expand wherever he would go. It is after this that Nepal, which was divided into several provinces, was unified.”","Cm yogi had made a strong pitch for reinstatement of nepal’s ‘hindu nation’ status in 2015.

WASHINTON: The Trump White House on Tuesday flagged New Delhi’s tariffs on American bourbon, accounting for a pittance of overall US exports, as a contentious issue at a time the World Health Organisation has said no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.Ignoring India’s lowering of duty on American bourbon from 150% to 100% just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Feb 13 visit to Washington, Trump’s spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted on Tuesday that India’s 150% tariff on American alcohol is unhelpful, even as the US President was outside promoting Tesla, which is also making inroads into India much to his disapproval of a prospective manufacturing facility there.“Look at India, 150% tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that’s helping Kentucky Bourbon be exported to India? I don’t think so,” Leavitt raged at the WH press briefing, pulling out what she called a “handy-dandy chart” of tariffs imposed by various countries on American products.“President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about dang time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers,” Leavitt fumed, even as Trump’s erratic tariff policy that changes by the day has caused turmoil in global markets.Leavitt also seemed not to take note of India’s well-publicised lowering of tariffs on bourbon from 150% to 50%, with an additional tax of 50%, bringing down the overall duty to 100%.Much of the grandstanding appeared to involve domestic politics where Kentucky, the fount of American bourbon and a solid red Republican state, has a Democratic governor who defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in the 2023 gubernatorial elections.India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion — of about $3 trillion overall US global exports — with Europe being the major market for American alcohol.American whiskeys account for 63% of all US spirits exports, reaching $1.4 billion in 2023.But renowned for its fried chicken, Kentucky wants to supplement it with bourbon to India, a whisky-loving country that is famously said to drink more Scotch than is manufactured in Scotland. Kentucky’s Republican lawmakers eager to advance the state’s economy and keep it solidly red have taken note of India’s lowering of duties on bourbon but that’s inadequate for the White House.“Big win for Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry! Due to President Trump’s leadership, India is cutting tariffs on bourbon by 50%, expanding the global marketplace for our distillers. I met with treasury secretary Bessent and incoming commerce secretary Lutnick to ensure America’s signature spirit is treated fairly in all corners of the world,” Andy Barr, a GOP congressman from the state, said recently.But for a White House intoxicated with the prospect of making America richer, that’s not enough.It wants India to drink more, never mind the WHO advisory that alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen which also includes asbestos, radiation, and tobacco.","India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for american spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion — of about $3 trillion overall us global exports.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average pm2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) it was more than 25 times higher than who-recommended level and over three times more than indian ambient air quality standards.

These scams, often operating in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, promise lucrative salaries and attractive benefits.

Enforcement and oversight

In a move to combat the spread of misinformation and deepfakes, Spain's government has approved a bill imposing significant fines on companies that fail to label AI-generated content. This legislation aligns with the European Union's AI Act, which mandates strict transparency requirements for high-risk AI systems.The new bill classifies the failure to label AI-generated content as a ""serious offence,"" punishable by fines of up to 35 million euros ($38.2 million) or 7% of a company's global annual turnover. The legislation aims to ensure that AI systems do not harm society by spreading misinformation or undermining democracy.Digital Transformation Minister Oscar Lopez emphasised the importance of transparency in AI-generated content, stating, ""AI is a very powerful tool that can be used to improve our lives … or to spread misinformation and attack democracy"". The bill targets the improper use of AI, including subliminal techniques and biometric classification, to protect vulnerable groups and maintain public trust.The enforcement of the new rules will be overseen by the newly-created AI supervisory agency, AESIA . Specific cases involving data privacy, crime, elections, credit ratings, insurance, or capital market systems will be handled by their respective regulatory authorities.Spain is among the first EU countries to implement the bloc's comprehensive AI regulations, which are considered more stringent than the voluntary compliance framework in the United States.","Spain's government has approved a bill imposing significant fines on companies that fail to label ai-generated content.

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah wynn-williams served as director of public policy under sheryl sandberg for six years at facebook.

'No one is expelling anyone from Gaza': Trump addresses 'takeover' proposal controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-is-expelling-anyone-from-gaza-trump-addresses-takeover-proposal-controversy/articleshow/118956380.cms,"Taoiseach Micheal Martin with President Donald Trump ahead of the White House St Patrick's Day reception (AP photo)

""He has become a Palestinian..."" Trump attacks Chuck Schumer, says “not Jewish anymore”

Trump's 'Gaza takeover proposal'

Amid controversy over previously suggested 'Gaza takeover', US President Donald Trump clarified that no residents would be ""expelled"" from the region.The statement was delivered at a press conference from the Oval Office, before his discussion with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin at the White House on Wednesday (local time).Sitting alongside Martin, Trump declared, ""No one is expelling anyone from Gaza,"" when questioned by a reporter about the ""president's plan"" for the war-torn region.Meanwhile, Martin emphasised the necessity of enhancing aid to Gaza whilst advocating for both a ceasefire and the liberation of hostages in Hamas custody since the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. This comes after, Israel's diplomatic relations with Ireland faced a setback when it declared the shuttering of its embassy in Ireland during December, attributing the decision to Ireland's stance against Israel. The action followed Ireland's backing of South Africa's legal proceedings against Israel at the International Court of Justice, where allegations of genocide were raised.In a separate development during the meeting, Trump referred to US Senate's minority leader Chuck Schumer as ""a Palestinian"". He said, ""Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. He's become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian."" A comparable comment about Schumer appeared on his Truth Social platform in February.Last month, Trump put forward a proposal suggesting that the United States should assume control and ownership of the Gaza Strip. His vision included rebuilding the region entirely and converting it into a centre of economic activity.During a joint media briefing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump said, ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site and getting rid of the destroyed buildings. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.""Later, In a post on Truth Social, Trump echoed the sentiment saying, “The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians, people like Chuck Schumer, would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region.

Columbia University- A 'centre' for campus protests in US

Following the arrest of a prominent Palestinian campus activist Mahmoud Khalil by immigration officials , Columbia University 's administrators convened students and faculty from the journalism school to deliver a cautionary message.Stuart Karle, a First Amendment lawyer and adjunct professor, advised non-US citizen students to refrain from publishing content about the Gaza Strip, Ukraine and protests related to their former classmate's arrest. With graduation approaching, their academic achievements and personal liberty could face jeopardy under the Trump administration 's scrutiny, warned Karle. ""If you have a social media page, make sure it is not filled with commentary on the Middle East,"" he said, addressing the assembly in Pulitzer Hall.When a Palestinian student raised objections, Jelani Cobb, the journalism school's dean, spoke frankly about the institution's limitations in protecting international students from federal action. ""Nobody can protect you,"" Cobb said. ""These are dangerous times.""Additionally, in an interview Wednesday, quoted by the NYT, Cobb said he and his colleagues were trying to make it clear to their students at the town hall that they were in a moment of great risk. ""We were giving a brutally honest rendering of what the landscape is right now,"" he said.Columbia University has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests against the Gaza war.The situation intensified last week when the Trump administration withdrew $400 million in federal grants and contracts, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism. Columbia's interim president indicated this would affect ""nearly every corner of the university.""The following day, immigration authorities arrested recent graduate Khalil and removed him from university accommodation. President Donald Trump announced the revocation of Khalil's green card and impending deportation.Situated near major media outlets, Columbia emerged as the focal point of nationwide student protests last year. Their demonstrations sparked comparable protests at universities throughout the United States.Students supporting Palestinian liberation set up a camp at the university's centre in April, protesting the Gaza war and calling for the university to withdraw from ""all economic and academic stakes in Israel,"" including their joint programme with Tel Aviv University.Whilst most protests at Columbia remained non-violent, the growing encampment and student passion led some faculty and students to perceive the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism becoming increasingly unclear.Jewish students reported feeling unsafe on campus due to encampment displays supporting the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Specific antisemitism claims arose, including a controversial incident where a student protest leader stated, ""Zionists don't deserve to live."" (He was later suspended.)The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has historically created tension at Columbia. The university features significant student groups supporting both sides, a prominent Middle Eastern studies programme, and maintains a dual degree arrangement with Tel Aviv University.Columbia's legacy includes notable student activism since the 1960s and was home to Edward Said, the distinguished literary scholar and Palestinian advocate who authored ""Orientalism"".In the early 2000s, the university faced controversy over claims that pro-Palestinian academics had intimidated pro-Israel students. However, an academic panel investigation found no antisemitism evidence.Meanwhile, the present situation exceeds previous disagreements in scale. The Department of Education recently issued notices to 60 universities under investigation for breaching federal protections against ""antisemitic discrimination and harassment"".These institutions, ranging from Harvard University to the University of Tennessee, face ""potential enforcement actions"". However, Columbia faces unprecedented scrutiny and risks losing substantial federal funding over antisemitism allegations.",Columbia university has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests.
