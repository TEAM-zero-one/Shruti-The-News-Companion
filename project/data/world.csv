A wedding ceremony in the family of Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) president Simranjit Singh Mann has triggered a widespread debate within the Sikh community after a video from the event went viral on social media, drawing objections over the use of religious symbols traditionally now reserved for Sri Guru Granth Sahib.The video shows Govind Singh Sandhu , son of Simranjit Singh Mann’s daughter and a descendant of the Shahzadpur Riyasat family of Sandhu Jatts in present-day Ambala district of Haryana, during his wedding rituals. In the viral video, a(fly whisk) is seen being waved over Govind Singh Sandhu’s head, while another person holds a(umbrella – as mark of royalty), with the sound of drums and pipes at the background. Two turbaned Sikh men are also seen escorting him with spears, in keeping with what was described as a traditional princely custom of the erstwhile Shahzadpur Riyasat.However, the visuals soon sparked criticism from a section of the Sikh community. In the present Sikh tradition, theandare symbols of sovereignty and reverence exclusively associated with the movement and presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the living Sikh Guru. Critics alleged that performing such a “royal” ritual for an individual, even as part of a family tradition, amounted to disrespect towards the Sikh faith and its highest spiritual authority.Sikh users on social media not only questioned the conduct of Govind Singh Sandhu but also sought clarification from his relative, Simranjit Singh Mann, known for raising Sikh religious and political concerns. The issue gained momentum as the video continued to circulate widely, intensifying the debate on the limits between cultural heritage and religious sanctity.Amid the growing criticism, on Sunday, Govind Singh Sandhu himself came forward to issue a public apology. In a detailed social media post, he acknowledged the objections raised regarding the use of theandduring his wedding ceremony and emphasized that the concerns were linked to the authority of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji and Sikh sentiments.Explaining his position, Govind Singh Sandhu stated that the holding ofand the waving ofhad historically been part of ancient princely wedding ceremonies, followed by his family for generations as descendants of the Shahzadpur princely state. He said the ritual was performed during the(marriage procession led by bridegroom) departure ceremony as a cultural tradition and mark of respect, without any intention to undermine Sikh beliefs.At the same time, Sandhu categorically acknowledged that in the present era, such reverence is reserved solely for Sri Guru Granth Sahib. “The owner of the Chaur, Chhatar and Takht of the Sikhs is only the revered Sri Guru Granth Sahib,” he wrote, adding that it is only due to the Guru’s blessings that Sikhs enjoy happiness and spiritual fulfillment.Govind Singh Sandhu clarified that the brief ritual should not be seen as equating any individual with the eternal greatness of the Gurus. Taking full responsibility, he admitted that waving thein this context was a mistake and apologized to the entire Sikh community with folded hands. He also expressed his intention to seek forgiveness at the feet of the Guru, hoping that the community would pardon what he described as an unintentional error.The incident has once again highlighted the sensitivity surrounding Sikh religious symbols and the ongoing conversation about preserving cultural traditions without crossing boundaries that may hurt religious sentiments.","Video shows govind singh sandhu during his wedding rituals.

JAMMU: The ongoing hunt for three fugitive ultras in the snowbound Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt was intensified on Sunday — day 15 of Operation Trashi-I.Security forces and terrorists had briefly exchanged bullets in Dolgam area Saturday. One terrorist was believed to have sustained injuries, as drone footage purportedly showed blood trails, officials said. Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Pratik Sharma had visited Kishtwar on Saturday to review the counter-terrorism grid.The latest gunfight was the fourth encounter since initial contact was established in Sonnar forest near Mandral-Singhpora, Chatroo, on Jan 18, in which eight security personnel were injured, one of whom eventually succumbed.On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead.After an overnight cordon, the searches resumed early Sunday and continued till late in the night.Officials said the ultras, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground.The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. After leaving a fortified hideout on Jan 19, the terrorists might have run out of rations and consumables, especially in view of the hostile weather conditions.Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.","Security forces and terrorists exchanged bullets in dolgam area saturday.

UNSC Drama As Pakistan Flags Indus Waters Treaty After India Calls Out Terror Nexus Lies, Deception

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday categorically rejected “baseless” allegations made by Pakistan that recent attacks in Balochistan, which killed dozens, had Indian backing.Multiple suicide and gun attacks by “terrorists” on Saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians, while security forces responding to the violence killed 92 assailants.In a statement on X, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We categorically reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan, which are nothing but its usual tactics to deflect attention from its own internal failings.”The MEA added that Pakistan should focus on addressing the long-standing demands of the people in Balochistan, as “suppression and violation of human rights” in the region is well known.“Instead of parroting frivolous claims each time there is a violent incident, it would do better to focus on addressing long-standing demands of its people in the region. Its record of suppression, brutality and violation of human rights is well known,” the statement said.The response came after Pakistan’s military and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi alleged that the attackers involved in the violence had Indian support.The attacks, described by analysts as the deadliest single day for militants in decades, targeted civilians, a high-security prison, police stations, and paramilitary installations. According to the military, 18 civilians, 15 security personnel, and 92 insurgents were killed. Authorities said at least 133 militants were killed across Balochistan over the past 48 hours, including 92 on Saturday.The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attacks. Some banks were robbed, a police station was set on fire, and dozens of vehicles were torched. The BLA also released videos showing female fighters taking part in the attacks, apparently as part of propaganda efforts to highlight the role of women among militants.","Multiple suicide and gun attacks by “terrorists’ on saturday across the restive southwestern province killed 33 people, including civilians.

New Delhi: Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Saturday commenced “Operation Herof 2.0”, a large-scale military offensive characterised by synchronised attacks at dawn. While BLA claimed scores of casualties across the region, the official count stood at 12. The local administration claimed to have neutralised 58 BLA fighters.“Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan. During the clashes with the terrorists, 12 personnel of the security forces and the police were martyred,” the Pak media reported, quoting the administration and adding that the attacks were foiled due to “timely and effective action”. In a post on X, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed that Pak security forces had killed 70 rebels at various locations across the province during the past two days.Spanning around 12 districts and especially targeting the provincial capital, Quetta, this offensive marks a significant escalation in regional conflict and is being regarded as the most extensive assault since 2024.The attacks involved use of suicide bombers and a significant number of women rebels at Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat and Pasni where bank, govt offices and Frontier ops HQ were targeted.The attacks coincided with Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) top functionary Hafiz Hamdullah’s declaring that armed groups, not the state, now controlled Balochistan.BLA’s Hakkal media also released a new video footage showing commander Bashir Zeb leading armed separatist units on motorcycles.In a statement, BLA claimed to have brought under its control several areas of Quetta, besides Noshki jail and Pasni coast guard camp, police stations and the military intelligence office.

India Can Be Pivotal In Peace And Two-State Solution, Says Palestine Ambassador

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi met the Palestinian foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian, and reiterated India’s continued support for the people of Palestine and welcomed ongoing peace efforts, including the Gaza peace plan.The minister met the PM as a member of a delegation of the foreign ministers of Arab countries who are in India for the second India-Arab Foreign Ministers’ Meeting. The meeting saw external affairs minister S Jaishankar asserting that the countries targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves.According to an Indian readout, Modi conveyed his appreciation for the important role played by the Arab League in supporting efforts towards regional peace and stability.“The Arab world is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood, linked by deep civilisational bonds, vibrant people-to-people connections and enduring brotherly ties, as well as a shared commitment to peace, progress and stability. Confident that enhanced cooperation in technology, energy, trade and innovation will unlock new opportunities and take the partnership to new heights,” said Modi in a post on X.Highlighting the “humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the Palestinian minister told Modi Palestine values India’s principled support for Palestinian rights under international law.According to external affairs ministry, the PM outlined his vision for the India-Arab partnership in the years ahead and reaffirmed India’s commitment to further deepen cooperation in trade and investment, energy, technology, healthcare and other priority areas, for the mutual benefit of our peoples.“India has been a long-standing development partner for Palestine. This has been rendered both bilaterally and through UN agencies. India has so far given assistance worth USD 170 million. Of these, projects worth USD 40 million are under implementation,” said a source.In the foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar strongly raised the issue of cross-border terrorism saying it’s particularly unacceptable because it violates the basic principles of international relations and diplomacy. He also told the Arab foreign ministers societies targeted by terrorism have the right to defend themselves and will understandably exercise it. “It is essential that we strengthen international cooperation to combat what is a global scourge. Zero-tolerance for terrorism must be an uncompromising universal norm,” he said.He also said the changing landscape in West Asia has implications for India’s relations with the Arab world as well and taking forward the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict was a widely shared priority.“Various countries have made policy declarations on the peace plan, individually or collectively.

New Delhi: Days after India and European Union clinched what has been termed as ‘mother of all trade deals’, CJI Surya Kant on Saturday wooed French industrialists and businessmen to invest in India by hard-selling Supreme Court–backed trade-friendly legal system in the country. Referring to the uncertain business atmosphere in the world, apparently because of arbitrary import tariffs imposed by the US on various countries, CJI Kant said, “Today, we face a world transformed by uncertainty.”“The forces of disruption and geopolitical tension threaten to destabilise the very framework of international cooperation. In such a world, France-India partnership is not a luxury, it is a lifeline.”Addressing the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Paris Bar Association, the CJI said that for foreign enterprises engaging with their Indian counterparts, India’s legal ecosystem offers clarity. “All that one would have to do is draft well-defined arbitration clauses, select reputable institutions or neutral seats if appropriate and trust that India’s courts will respect the sanctity of arbitral agreements and awards,” he said.CJI Kant said SC provides a safety net against any biased arbitral awards that may adversely impact foreign companies operating in India. “SC has made it clear that while arbitral autonomy must be respected, the judiciary cannot relinquish its supervisory role when natural justice is at stake.” “In this context, SC has adopted a calibrated approach of minimal judicial intervention in its role as guardian of credibility, where, for instance, domestic awards may be set aside if bias, corruption or serious procedural deficiencies are proven,” he said.Indian laws encourage pre-litigation mediation. “This approach reflects global best practice: to resolve differences before they ripen into full-fledged litigation, preserving business relationships and reducing strain on judicial systems,” he said.",Cji surya kant wooed french industrialists and businessmen to invest in india by hard-selling supreme court–backed trade-friendly legal system.

Cam Skattebo’s offseason break heats up as girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez makes waves with daring Cabo look,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cam-skattebos-offseason-break-heats-up-as-girlfriend-chloe-rodriguez-makes-waves-with-daring-cabo-look/articleshow/127850482.cms,"Cam Skattebo's Girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez (Instagram)

Cam Skattebo offseason break draws spotlight in Cabo



Cam Skattebo’s offseason break has become a talking point far beyond the New York Giants locker room, as his recovery period now overlaps with a sun-soaked escape that has drawn plenty of attention. The focus keyword surfaces immediately because this moment captures what is happening now: a young NFL running back rehabbing an injury while his personal life lights up social media in unexpected ways.While Skattebo continues to work back from a broken ankle suffered in October, his girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez has emerged as an offseason standout. Her recent Cabo San Lucas appearance has sparked buzz, offering fans a glimpse of how the couple is spending a rare pause away from football.It is a snapshot of rest, resilience, and visibility during a crucial stretch of Skattebo’s career.Skattebo’s rookie season with the Giants ended abruptly when his ankle was rolled up on and bent awkwardly against Philadelphia. Before that setback, the former Arizona State standout had carved out a promising role, piling up 410 rushing yards with five touchdowns and adding 207 receiving yards and two more scores.The numbers hinted at growth. His post-injury message later struck an optimistic tone, one that likely caught the attention of new Giants coach John Harbaugh.The timing of this offseason break matters. Skattebo is not just resting; he is recovering, recalibrating, and staying visible. Cabo San Lucas became the backdrop where that balance played out publicly. Rodriguez shared a series of beachside photos, highlighted by a striking blue and white bikini moment captioned, “cabo wabo 🏝️🍹“. The post traveled fast, reinforcing how modern NFL narratives now blend performance, personality, and presence.Rodriguez has been a steady figure alongside Skattebo all winter. The couple was spotted together during the holidays in New York, where her Rockefeller Center look also turned heads. Cabo simply amplified that momentum. The images suggested ease and confidence, with Skattebo appearing relaxed as he continues to heal.The trip also doubled as a reunion of sorts. Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart joined Skattebo in Mexico, extending a rookie-season bond that had already become fan lore. The two recreated a familiar pose from earlier in the year, a callback to sideline moments that once symbolized their on-field chemistry. Dart, now dating model Marissa Ayers, was also seen enjoying the vacation, even landing an impressive catch of his own.For Skattebo, this offseason chapter blends recovery with renewal. The ankle will dictate his return. The spotlight, however, shows no sign of fading.","New york giants running back cam skattebo is recovering from a broken ankle.

These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and silver prices tumbled on Sunday, hitting their lower circuit levels in futures trade, ahead of Union Budget 2026-27 presentation. Gold futures for April 2, 2026, delivery fell Rs 9,140, or 6%, to Rs 1,43,205 per 10 grams, while silver futures for March 5, 2026, delivery dropped Rs 17,515, or 6%, to Rs 2,74,410 per kg.As the precious metals continued their steep fall, MCX shares slipped 10% to hit the lower circuit of Rs 2,145.25. The selloff follows Friday’s historic crash, which saw both silver and gold record their sharpest single-day falls. According to analysts, investors rushing to book profits and a stronger US dollar were key drivers behind the correction.The MCX remained open on February 1, for a special Sunday session as finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the Union Budget 2026.The sudden dip came after months of record-breaking gains in both metals. Gold had surged to Rs 1,83,000 per 10 grams and silver to Rs 4,04,500 per kg on Thursday. By Friday, gold futures for February delivery were trading at Rs 1.5 lakh per 10 grams, and silver for March delivery had fallen to Rs 3 lakh per kg, recording a drop of more than Rs 1 lakh.According to Mirae Asset ShareKhan data, the yellow metal's market capitalisation fell by almost $3.5 trillion, while silver shed approximately $1.5 trillion, taking the combined decline to $5 trillion.Despite the recent plunge, gold has gained $3 trillion and silver $2 trillion since the start of the year. Over the past two years, international gold prices have risen 150%, while silver has climbed 326%.Experts said the fall was driven by a mix of profit-booking, heavy liquidation of long positions, and a strengthening US dollar. Speculation over the US Federal Reserve’s leadership added further pressure. President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh, an inflation hawk, surprised markets.Maneesh Sharma, AVP - commodities & currencies at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, told TOI, “on Wednesday, US Fed also maintained the status quo, keeping rates unchanged after revealing an improvement in the labor market. Regarding inflation, they said that it remains elevated and sticks to its data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.”He added, “Sharp moves in precious metals seen on Friday reflected speculation that Warsh may be less enthusiastic to cut rates given his past warnings of inflation risks and more recent calls for the Fed to reduce its balance sheet. This led to a rise in Dollar & Yields weighing on sentiments for bullions complex.”","Gold and silver prices tumbled on sunday, hitting their lower circuit levels in futures trade.

Why did stock market crashing after Budget 2026? Top reasons

What’s the outlook for stock market? What should investors do?

Stock market crash after Budget 2026 speech: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 's Union Budget speech has spooked stock markets, with both Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , crashing over 2% in the special trading session being held. Nifty50 ended the special trading session at 24,825.45, down 593 points or 2.33%. BSE Sensex ended at 80,722.94, down 1,843 points or 2.23%.Investors reacted negatively to a hike in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options (F&O) trades announced by FM Sitharaman. Narendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services,Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited is of the view that stock markets are seeing a knee-jerk reaction.“Markets witnessed a knee-jerk reaction following the unexpected hike in STT on Futures and Options, as hopes of a reduction in capital gains tax had already been priced in,” he said.“I propose to raise the STT on Futures to 0.05 percent from present 0.02 percent. STT on options premium and exercise of options are both proposed to be raised to 0.15 percent from the present rate of 0.1 percent and 0.125 percent respectively,” she announced.The announcement on STT sparked aggressive selling, particularly in stocks associated with trading, broking, and market activity, as stock market participants reassessed the increased cost of operating in the derivatives segment.What is STT? It is a government-imposed levy on every buy and sell transaction in the equity market, futures and options. Though the tax may seem small in percentage terms, it directly adds to transaction expenses, especially affecting active traders, hedgers, and arbitrage participants. It is important to note that the hike in STT announced in Budget is only for futures and options.Brokerage and exchange-related stocks led the market decline. Shares of BSE Ltd, Groww parent Billionbrains Garage Ventures, and Angel One tumbled by as much as 13.5%. BSE Ltd slipped to an intraday low of Rs 2,517.30, while Angel One fell to Rs 2,284.70.Selling pressure was not limited to brokerage counters. Heavyweight stocks also weighed on the benchmarks, with Reliance Industries declining around 2.5% and State Bank of India sliding nearly 5%, deepening losses on the headline indices.The downturn was widespread across the broader market, as risk aversion dominated trading. Small-cap stocks dropped about 3%, while the midcap index fell roughly 2%, highlighting a broad-based retreat by investors.Market participants noted that the announcement came at a time when equities were already grappling with volatility and selling pressure. The abrupt increase in transaction costs intensified concerns, triggering a widespread sell-off across sectors.Commenting on the development, Shripal Shah, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Securities, said the steep increase in STT could dampen derivatives activity. He noted that the sharp hike in futures and options taxes, following last year’s increase, is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers, and arbitrageurs, potentially cooling trading activity and reducing volumes.Shah added that the government’s objective appears to be curbing excessive trading rather than maximising revenue. Any additional revenue from higher STT, he said, could be offset by lower derivatives volumes as higher costs discourage participation.With markets already under strain, the latest Budget proposal is being viewed as an added near-term downside risk for equities.""The Budget is clearly supportive of infrastructure, manufacturing, and digital-led themes. However, the absence of capital gains tax relief and the increase in STT create near-term headwinds for the broader market. Investors should remain selective, focus on quality sectors with strong policy visibility, and avoid aggressive short-term bets.Defensive allocation and long-term positioning remain key in navigating post-Budget volatility. Markets were expecting relief on LTCG and STCG taxation, but no proposals were announced, which may result in continued FII selling. Adding to the pressure, the hike in STT on futures and options acts as a broad-based negative for market sentiment. Positive sectors to watch Railways, Electronics, Semiconductors, Pharma, Metals & Mining, and Data Centers. Strategy is to stay diversified, focus on structural growth sectors, and maintain a cautious approach in the near term,” says Somil Mehta, Head of Retail research at Mirae Asset Sharekhan.",Nifty50 and bse sensex crashed over 2% in the special trading session being held.

"World’s largest late Roman hoard of 50,000 ancient coins discovered off Sardinia near Arzachena",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/worlds-largest-late-roman-hoard-of-50000-ancient-coins-discovered-off-sardinia-near-arzachena/articleshow/127764917.cms,"Source: Biblical Archaeology Society

What the Sardinia coin find reveals about Roman money and movement

How Roman follis coins kept the empire moving

How nature protected the Sardinia coins over time

Why the Sardinia coin find stands out in Roman history





A casual swim off Sardinia turned into something remarkable. Near Arzachena, a diver spotted metal glinting faintly on the seabed. Curiosity sparked immediately. Authorities were alerted. What they found was astounding: thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces, many remarkably well-preserved despite centuries underwater.The coins lay scattered on sand between the beach and underwater seagrass. Small fragments of amphorae rested nearby. Some might have come from Africa, others from Asia. This stretch of coast was a busy trade route in late Roman times, bustling with merchants, ships, and goods.For a moment, the past was visible, resting quietly under the calm, blue Mediterranean waters.“The treasure found in the waters off Arzachena represents one of the most important coin discoveries in recent years,” said Luigi La Rocca, general director of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape at Italy’s Ministry of Culture. Experts say finds like this tell stories beyond collectors’ shelves. They capture moments in the economy, politics, and daily life of the Roman world.A snapshot of trade, rulers, and reforms that shaped ordinary people’s lives.It is more than antique coins. It's a small, detailed glimpse into history. The cache is located off Sardinia's northeastern coast, near contemporary Arzachena. The seabed forms a shallow platform. Currents move objects without burying them too deeply. The researchers identified two distinct sand zones, separated by extensive seagrass. That boundary is significant. Plant roots keep sediment in place, while coins and porcelain fragments peep through. Amphora fragments indicate commercial activity. Some come from North Africa, while others are from the eastern provinces. Merchants appear to have combined commodities from various routes on a single voyage.Most are follis, large bronze coins introduced during Diocletian’s currency reform. Early folles weighed about ten grams and had a thin silver wash. It made the base metal look respectable. Over time, silvering and weight declined as a signal of the pressures Rome faced in funding armies, bureaucracy, and public projects. Yet, face value kept everyday trade moving. By the early fourth century, folles linked people across the empire. Sailors, farmers, and merchants all used the same currency. Hoard like this helps historians track how far coins travelled and how interconnected the empire really was.Large coin groups usually tell a story. A storm might have spilled cargo. A captain might have stashed pay for the next port. Currents near Arzachena slow naturally, which could help concentrate objects. Scattering patterns suggest containers broke apart. Coins tumbled, lodged in pockets of sand, sometimes near amphora fragments. Archaeologists hope to reconstruct a voyage, its cargo, and perhaps its abrupt end.Seagrass might have saved the coins. Posidonia oceanica locks artifacts in low-oxygen sediment, slowing decay. The meadows trap particles, dampen waves, and create a quiet archive where coins and ceramics can last centuries.Even at the lower estimate, this find surpasses the Seaton Down Hoard in Britain, which held about 22,888 late Roman coins. The Sardinia discovery sets a new reference point for late Roman money in the western Mediterranean. Coins carry precise information. Icons, inscriptions, mint marks. Names of rulers. Slogans of the time. Their metal chemistry hints at water and sediment conditions. Tool marks reveal workshop practices. Matching amphora clay recipes might even link the coins to a cargo of oil or wine.","Thousands of fourth-century bronze coins, reportedly between 30,000 and 50,000 pieces.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration. On Saturday, just hours after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti—an intensive care nurse at the US Department of Veterans Affairs—Cook was spotted at a VIP screening of the ""Melania"" documentary at the White House.""This is a time for de-escalation,"" Cook wrote in Tuesday's message to staff. ""I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from.""Cook said he had a ""good conversation"" with Trump where he shared these views, though he didn't specify the president's response or any commitments made. ""I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,"" he added.The Apple chief has maintained close ties with the Trump administration since the president's re-election, becoming a regular fixture at White House events and policy briefings. Trump has frequently praised Cook in public speeches.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint for immigration enforcement tensions. Pretti's killing on Saturday followed another fatal ICE shooting on January 7, when agents killed 37-year-old poet Renée Good in the same city. Cook acknowledged the emotional toll on his workforce, praising their empathy as ""one of Apple's greatest strengths.""","Apple ceo tim cook expressed heartbreak over the minneapolis shootings, where two individuals were killed by federal immigration agents.
