Why Donald Trump’s Gaza Peace Board Has Indian-Origin Former Banker And Padma Shri Ajay Banga

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday attended the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace on Gaza as an “observer” country, without joining the initiative that has been set up by Trump for the redevelopment of the Gaza Strip.India was represented at the meeting, held at the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace in Washington DC, by Chargé d'affaires at the Indian Embassy Namgya Khampa, reported PTI.Trump pledged $10 billion for the new “Board of Peace,” saying the United States would fund the initiative aimed at rebuilding Gaza, which was reduced to rubble by two years of war between Hamas and Israel. Trump will wield veto power over the “Board of Peace” and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries seeking permanent membership instead of a two-year term will be required to pay $1 billion.Trump announced that the US will commit $10 billion to the Board, whose members include 27 nations such as Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.PM Narendra Modi was among the numerous global leaders that the US President had invited to join the board that was announced under the second phase of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.India was among the countries not present at a January 22 ceremony in Davos where Trump unveiled the Board of Peace that seeks to work towards bringing lasting peace to Gaza and possibly resolve other global conflicts.The Board of Peace is perceived as a rival to the UN. Trump has previously said that the Board of Peace “might” replace the UN, which he said has never lived up to its potential.The executive board, finalised on January 17, consists of a mix of diplomats and financiers, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga.While the US has outlined an initial $1 billion reconstruction package for housing and infrastructure, funding is strictly tied to security conditions.","India was represented at the meeting by chargé d'affaires at the indian embassy namgya khampa.

India Signals Tough Stand On Rafale Fighter Jet Deal, Seeks Deep Localisation And Tech Transfer

NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said that Rafale fighter jets will boost India’s military strength and that he is committed to having more indigenous content in ‘made-in-India Rafale', as sought by the Modi govt.Speaking on the sidelines of the AI-India Summit at the end of his three-day visit, Macron told the French and Indian media, “Rafale improves the strategic relations between us, and it creates more jobs here.” On criticism in some western quarters over the performance of the 4.5-gen fighter, especially during Operation Sindoor last year, the President said, “I don't see how people can criticise the aircraft because it (Rafale) makes your country stronger. ”Macron said France and India are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce Rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.“On Rafale, what we want to do is expand. India confirmed a few days ago its willingness to command a new bunch of Rafales... 114... and to co-produce in India,” he said. India's expected order for another 114 Rafales is a “new step forward” in defence ties. On India’s demand for increasing indigenous content in the jet’s co-production, Macron said, “Very clearly, we are extremely, I would say, committed to having a maximum number of Indian components and manufacturing a maximum number of critical devices in India.... We will have increased cooperation in maintenance and diversification.”Showing his willingness to sell more French submarines to India, Macron cited the tie-up on Rafales to make his case. “I hope we will do it on submarines. We have offered additional capacities,"" he said. The Indian Navy currently operates six French Scorpene submarines and there are plans to have more -- at least three -- such submarines from France in the near future.The President said India's push to co-produce Rafale fighter jets is a “legitimate” ambition that aligns with the “direction of history.... Rafale is the key.” He underscored the long-term necessity of this partnership, predicting that India's requirement for advanced aviation will only grow in the coming decades. “Looking ahead to 2040 and 2050, I am telling you, India will need combat aviation,” Macron said.“We don’t have a strategic partnership, we have a global spatial strategic partnership, which is unique for both France and India,” he said.Macron’s reaction came just days after the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council gave the initial clearance for acquiring 114 more Rafale jets and the defence minister discussed the jet deal with his French counterpart Catherine Vautrin as part of the India-France annual defence dialogue on Tuesday.","France and india are entering a new era of defence cooperation with plans to jointly produce rafale fighter jets as well as helicopters.

India Displays Naval Might At International Fleet Review 2026, President Murmu Lauds Indian Navy

NEW DELHI: India’s sea-based nuclear deterrent will be strengthened soon as the country’s third indigenous Arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Aridhaman (designated S4), is likely to be commissioned by April-May. “The commissioning of INS Aridhaman is expected by this summer as the submarine is currently in the final stages of sea trial,” a defence source told TOI.Last Dec, Navy chief Admiral D K Tripathi had said that INS Aridhaman would be commissioned this year.INS Aridhaman, built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project at the Ship Building Centre in Visakhapatnam, will be larger (7,000 tonne) than predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat (6,000 tonne), featuring enhanced capability to carry long-range K-4 missiles. INS Aridhaman will be armed with 24 K-15 Sagarika SLBMs (750 km range) and eight K-4 SLBMs (3,500 km range), which are capable of reaching most parts of Asia.Once it enters service, India will have three operational ballistic missile submarines under the Strategic Forces Command (SFC) at sea for the first time, moving the country closer to achieving ‘Continuous At-Sea Deterrence’, a strategic defence policy where a nation maintains at least one SSBN on patrol 365 days a year.As a stealthy underwater platform, INS Aridhaman boosts India’s “second-strike” capability—the ability to retaliate after a nuclear attack. It is designed to carry more long-range nuclear-tipped missiles than its predecessors INS Arihant and INS Arighaat.In addition to INS Aridhaman, the Indian Navy is securing an Akula-class SSN nuclear-powered attack submarine from Russia, commonly referred to as “Chakra III”, with expected delivery by 2027 or early 2028. Besides these submarine projects, India and Germany are in the final stages of negotiating a $8-10 billion Project-75(I) deal to build six advanced, conventional diesel-electric submarines equipped with Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) technology.The new submarine acquisitions are timely as Pakistan is acquiring eight advanced Hangor-class diesel-electric attack submarines from China under a $5 billion 2015 deal to bolster its naval capabilities.INS Aridhaman is equipped with an 83 MW pressurised water reactor and advanced sonar suites, possesses indigenous USHUS and Panchendriya sonar systems for better target detection and has improved acoustic damping with anechoic tiles to reduce noise, making it harder to detect. Once operational, it will be based at Project Varsha, a high-security facility with underground pens near Visakhapatnam.","Ins aridhaman is india's third indigenous arihant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine.

"Thyroid, infection drugs get fresh safety warnings after national review",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thyroid-infection-drugs-get-fresh-safety-warnings-after-national-review/articleshow/128577149.cms,"Decision taken after national review

NEW DELHI: Two medicines used widely - antibiotic doxycycline and thyroid drug carbimazole - will soon carry stronger safety warnings, following a national review of adverse drug reaction reports.After examining patient-level safety data, regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxycycline and a rare but potentially life-threatening blood disorder associated with carbimazole. In separate communications issued this month, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) directed all State and Union territory licensing authorities to ensure manufacturers update prescribing information and package inserts for both medicines and report compliance.For doxycycline - commonly prescribed for respiratory infections, acne, sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infection and numerous vector-borne diseases - the authorities have asked that specific central nervous system side effects be explicitly mentioned. These include restlessness, anxiety, irritability, nervousness and dizziness.The decision follows an assessment by Pharmacovigilance Programme of India, which reviewed adverse reaction reports and individual case safety data.The issue was examined at a Signal Review Panel meeting in March 2025 and later discussed by Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on antimicrobial and antiparasitic drugs in Jan 2026, which endorsed updating the official prescribing documents.While gastrointestinal discomfort and photosensitivity were already known side effects of doxycycline, the latest directive formally adds neuropsychiatric symptoms to the safety profile. Regulators have directed manufacturers of carbimazole - prescribed for hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease - to prominently warn about agranulocytosis, a rare but serious condition marked by a sharp fall in white blood cells.Agranulocytosis can leave patients vulnerable to severe infections. Early warning signs include fever, sore throat and unexplained infections. The recommendation emerged from the 26th Signal Review Panel meeting and was subsequently reviewed by SEC on endocrinology and metabolism before being approved for inclusion in prescribing information leaflet.Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of Internal Medicine at Max Hospital, Saket, said the move reflects a maturing safety system. ""CDSCO's decision on for doxycycline and carbimazole reflects a proactive and responsible pharmacovigilance system. While the medicines remain safe and effective when used appropriately, clearer warnings help both doctors and patients recognise rare but important side effects early. In the case of carbimazole, prompt attention to symptoms like fever or sore throat can be life-saving. Such regulatory steps strengthen patient safety without creating unnecessary alarm,"" he said.For patients, the updated leaflets mean clearer information on risks. For clinicians, the advisory reinforces the need to counsel patients on warning symptoms and monitor use appropriately.",Decision taken after national review of adverse drug reaction reports. Regulators have flagged possible mental health symptoms linked to doxycycline. Also a rare but potentially life-threatening blood disorder associated with carbimazole.

Why it matters for India

NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday dismissed the criticisms on Rafale deal with India, saying that it only made ""your country stronger"".""We are always increasing indigenous components. It's part of the dialogue between the company and your government. I don't see how people can criticise because it makes your country stronger, it increases the strategic coordination between us, and it creates more jobs here,"" he said, speaking to the reporters.""Very clearly, we are extremely committed to having the maximum number of Indian components and manufacturing the maximum number of critical devices in India,"" he added.""The Indians, who are currently customers, want to co-produce with us; we have seen the Rafale here, but they want to co-produce combat aircraft in India. They want to handle more of the maintenance, which is legitimate,"" Macron said.Defence ministry, earlier this month, cleared the path for what officials describe as the “mother of all defence deals,” with the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approving the procurement of 114 Rafale fighter jets from France.The deal marks a major step in strengthening the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) combat capability at a critical juncture.Although the United States and Russia had offered their fifth-generation fighters — the F-35 and Su-57 — defence planners ultimately viewed the Dassault Rafale as a proven, combat-ready platform capable of being inducted without the long timelines associated with newer-generation aircraft.The decision comes as India works to bridge a widening capability gap. While New Delhi has placed orders for 180 Tejas Mark 1A jets under its indigenous programme, production delays linked to engine supplies have slowed deliveries.The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), India’s proposed fifth-generation stealth fighter, is not expected to enter operational service before the mid-2030s. In that context, the Rafale acquisition serves as a critical stopgap, ensuring the IAF maintains squadron strength and technological superiority during the transition.The Rafale’s operational value has already been demonstrated. During Operation Sindoor, Rafale jets deployed 250-km-range SCALP cruise missiles in precision strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan’s Muridke and Bahawalpur districts.The missile system — guided by inertial navigation, GPS, terrain-referenced navigation and an infrared imaging seeker — enabled deep-penetration attacks with high accuracy.","French president emmanuel macron dismissed the criticisms on rafale deal with india, saying that it only made ""your country stronger"" ""we are always increasing indigenous components.

NEW DELHI: Israel on Thursday condemned the attack on two Indian workers in the city of Ashkelon, calling the incident “absolutely unacceptable.”The Israeli embassy in India also denounced the assault and said action had been taken against those responsible. In a post on X, it said, “The attack on two Indian workers yesterday in Ashkelon by delinquents is absolutely unacceptable. The Israeli police have caught the perpetrators and will bring them to justice.”The two workers were reportedly beaten in Ashkelon, located about 50 km from Tel Aviv. Israeli media described the assault as a “targeted, racially motivated attack.”Congress leader Pawan Khera raised concerns over the incident and urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to intervene. In a post on X, he said, “It was a premeditated racist assault, planned over private chats. This is not the first such attack. And sadly, it may not be the last.”He added, “The government’s failure to generate adequate employment at home has pushed Indian labourers to seek work in Israel. It celebrates Indo-Israel ‘friendship’ when sending Indian labourers there. But when our people face barbaric treatment, it falls silent and shrugs off responsibility.”Tagging Jaishankar, he said the minister “should urgently look into the matter, confirm the victim’s condition, and ensure he has access to adequate, free-of-cost medical care if required.”Khera also questioned whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would raise the issue during his upcoming visit to Israel. “PM Modi is visiting Israel soon, will he raise the issue of racism and violent attacks against Indian nationals in Israel?” he asked.According to TRT World, the incident comes at a time when India has chosen not to join more than 80 countries that criticised Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank in a joint statement at the United Nations.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Israel next week, marking his second trip to the country since 2017.","The two workers were reportedly beaten in ashkelon, located about 50 km from tel aviv.

PM Modi Pushes Human Centric AI Model, Launches MANAV Framework At Mega AI Impact Summit 2026

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushed on Thursday for democratisation of AI, saying it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment and a force for global good, especially across the Global South, while taking aim at countries and companies that consider AI to be a strategic asset that must be developed in secrecy.Questioning the walls that have come up around the development of AI as it is leveraged by countries and companies as a force and profit multiplier, Modi said India thinks different. ""It is said sunlight is the best disinfectant. We believe AI will benefit the world only when it is shared. When codes are open and shared, millions of young minds can make them safer and better. Therefore, let us resolve to develop AI as a global common good,"" he said.Speaking at the AI Impact Summit and with heads of foreign govts and tech giants and representatives of 100 countries in audience, Modi cautioned against reducing individuals to ""mere data points or raw material"" and unveiled India's approach of ""MANAV"" framework of ""responsible AI"". He said AI's transformative power must be a multiplier.At a time when fears have grown about AI, which, while generating impressive benefits in diverse fields, can lead to risks ranging from autonomous weapon systems, machines breaking free of control of developers, and breakthroughs widening the gap between powerful countries and others, the PM struck a positive yet cautious note.He noted the wariness about the consequences which could have not been imagined until very recently, but focused on the enthusiasm with which the youth have approached, what he called, the latest of turning points in history.""Today, the world is divided into two kinds of people: those who see fear in AI and speak only of that fear, and those who see fortune in AI. I say with responsibility and with pride that India does not see fear in AI, India sees fortune in AI. India sees the future in AI,"" Modi said.He acknowledged the task that govts and societies face and said while history has seen many turning points, the transformative change represented by AI is unprecedented in terms of speed and scale.The PM sought to strike a balance between increasingly desperate cries for regulating AI and those saying that curbs could stifle innovation, thus nipping potential breakthroughs, which hold the key to challenges of Alzheimer's, cancer and climate change. ""We must give AI the open sky, but keep the command in our hands. Just like GPS - it suggests the route - but the final decision of direction is ours. The path we choose for AI today will determine the future we create tomorrow,"" he said.On Wednesday, senior White House policy adviser on Artificial Intelligence, Sriram Krishnan, had said that the US wants to make sure that the world uses the American AI stack.Modi said India's perspective on AI is reflected in the theme of the summit - Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya - Welfare for all, Happiness for all' - and that is India's benchmark. He said that the emergence of AI is a turning point for human civilisation and urged global leaders and innovators to ensure that the technology remains human-centric, inclusive and ethically governed.Highlighting the need for setting up of global standards, PM flagged deepfakes and fabricated content that are bringing instability to open societies. Drawing a parallel with nutrition labels on food which make a person aware of what they are eating, the PM said the digital world should have authenticity labels on content so that people know what is real and what is created by AI.""As Artificial Intelligence is creating more text, images and videos, the need for watermarking and clear source standards in the industry is increasing. That's why it's necessary that this trust be built in to technology from the beginning,"" he added.The PM said alongside the present generation, there is a need to consider what form of AI will future generations get. Drawing another parallel with nuclear power, where the world has seen its destructive force, and its positive contributions, Modi said, ""AI, too, is a transformative power - if directionless, it leads to disruption; if guided rightly, it becomes a solution. How to make AI human-centric, sensitive and responsible is the core purpose of AI Impact Summit,"" he added.","Pm narendra modi pushes for democratisation of ai, says it must become a tool for inclusion and empowerment.

Govts must work together for safe Net: Macron

PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday spoke on the need to shield children from the harms of AI and social media. ""We must become even more vigilant about children's safety. Just as a school syllabus is carefully curated, the AI space too must be child-safe and family-guided,"" Modi said at the India AI Impact Summit.Addressing the summit earlier, Macron expressed hope that India would join France and other countries in banning social media networks for children under 15 years of age, emphasising that protecting children is about not just regulation but civilisation as well. He said there was no reason to expose children to content online that is legally forbidden in the real world.The French leader struck a bullish note on India being part of AI revolution and benefiting from it. Backing India and Europe's AI aspirations, he said India had proved the world wrong after being told a decade ago that 1.4 billion people could not be brought into the digital economy.On a ban on social media networks for children under 15 years of age, Macron said France is embarking on the journey, with several European countries also committed to it.Australia has become the first country to ban social media for children under 16 and, in India, BJP ally TDP has pushed for a regulation along similar lines.""I know, Mr Prime Minister, you will join this club. And this is great news that India will join such an approach to protect children and teenagers,"" he said, referring to Narendra Modi who was in the audience along with other global leaders and tech bigwigs. IT minister Ashwini Vaishnav had on Tuesday said that India was debating the issue of restricting children's access to social media.""Our platforms, govts and regulators should be working together to make the Internet and social media a safe space,"" Macron said.He also emphasised France's shared vision with India to ensure access to AI for everyone at a time when it has become a ""major field of strategic competition"".""Hegemony from any quarter is not a fatality. There is a path for innovation, independence and strategic autonomy. And this path, I'm convinced, is what countries like France and India must take together,"" he said, heaping praise on India for its advances in providing digital access, be it for identity or financial transaction, to its entire population. ""That is not just a tech story. That is a civilisation story,"" he said.""Access to Al for all is critical. France and India share a common vision: a sovereign Al used to protect our planet and to foster prosperity for all."" He said the future of Al will be built by those who combine innovation and responsibility, and technology with humanity. ""India and France will help shape this future together. We are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game. And to do it with our allies because we believe in core shared values.

Visakhapatnam: Defence minister Rajnath Singh urged global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity, as India opened its largest-ever multilateral naval exercise, Exercise MILAN-2026.""When our ships sail together, when our sailors train together, and when our commanders deliberate together, we build a shared understanding that transcends geography and politics,"" he said on Thursday.The defence minister addressed visiting navy chiefs and delegations from nine Asean members at the inaugural ceremony, welcoming participation that has grown from four foreign navies in 1995 to 74 nations this year.Navies now shoulder a broader burden as global commerce surges and competition sharpens around chokepoints and channels, he said.

Terror networks spanning borders complicate security, while climate change is intensifying disasters and pushing humanitarian missions to the fore. ""No single navy, however capable, can address these challenges alone,"" Singh said.Inviting Asean countries to tap India's expanding defence-industrial base, he said the govt's Aatmanirbhar Bharat push led by PM Narendra Modi has transformed India into a ""builder's navy"". He cited aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and the Visakhapatnam-class destroyers as proof of growing indigenous shipbuilding capacity.Singh traced India's maritime outlook from SAGAR to its expanded vision, MAHASAGAR, signalling wider engagement. He backed United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as a durable framework and called for stronger global naval architecture. India, he said, will remain a steady ""vishwa mitra"" in the Indo-Pacific.","Rajnath singh urges global powers to confront fast-evolving, intertwined maritime risks through cooperation rooted in respect and reciprocity.

Mumbai Hosts Modi-Macron Talks, Rafale In Focus; Bill Gates To Attend AI Summit Under Epstein Cloud

NEW DELHI: After days of speculation, Bill Gates did not deliver his scheduled keynote at the AI Impact Summit 2026 , with the Gates Foundation announcing the decision just hours before the address on Thursday.The Foundation had stated a day earlier that the keynote will go ahead as planned. However, Thursday morning, it was announced on X that the Microsoft founder will skip the speech. In a brief statement, the foundation said the decision was taken ""after careful consideration"" to ensure that attention remains on the summit's key priorities.Gates was due to deliver a short but high-profile address on opportunities and risks linked to artificial intelligence. His withdrawal comes amid renewed public discussion around his past association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , following release of emails bearing his name in late Jan. In recent weeks, some opposition parties and media commentators in India had questioned whether Gates' presence at the summit was appropriate.Despite the debate, preparations appeared unchanged earlier this week. On Tuesday, the Foundation's India office had posted that Gates would attend the summit and deliver his keynote as scheduled.The Foundation said Ankur Vora, president of its Africa and India offices, would deliver the keynote in Gates' place. The Foundation added that it remains fully committed to its work in India to advance shared health and development goals.",Microsoft founder bill gates does not deliver keynote at ai impact summit 2026.

What has been the focus here?

""Don't Want To Be Dependent On US Or China…"" Macron On AI Innovation

So, there is a concern over concentration risk as most of the AI innovation and development is happening in the US or in China.

Is this also a signal that Europe hasn't done enough in the last few decades to stay ahead of the curve in terms of new technologies and innovation?

How does India fit into this scheme of things?

Regulation is something which is an area of concern for innovators and for companies in AI. How do you balance the two?

You have called for a systemic pressure on Russia to end the war with Ukraine. What role do you see India playing in this?

India has been buying oil from Russia and there has been pressure from the US to stop that. Europe, including the Netherlands is buying processed fuel from India and you also buy LNG from Russia. How do you address this and should India stop buying oil from Russia?

Outgoing PM of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, in an interview with TOI’s Sidhartha, says he is worried over concentration of AI development, and calls for lowering dependence on a few economies, while underlining the need for responsible use of the technology. Excerpts:China and the US both have their AI strategy. It was important that we had a meeting in India as we don't want to be dependent on one or the two powerhouses, we want to create our own artificial intelligence. That was also one of the main themes. The other theme is that we want responsible AI, not only AI for profit or control, but responsible AI to do with human values of privacy and reliability.Yes, and it goes into the bigger picture. In Europe, we have a lot of discussions these days that we don't want to be too dependent on only one company or country. We want to diversify. That's also why the EU has a lot of new trade agreements, including with India, but also relates to other issues. Europe is stepping up its defensive spending within NATO because of the threat of Russia. We don't want to be too dependent on the US and the same is true for other economies. It's more about autonomy, but at the same time about partnerships with different countries.Everybody in Europe agrees that we are lagging behind and we have to step up, especially in high tech, biotech, etc.We are now having a lot of discussions on how to achieve that and have funds for innovation and making sure that we step up on renewable energy, AI, high tech, data centres, etc.India is a very interesting partner because it is now stepping up rapidly and successfully in the field of high tech and AI. For example, we have in the Netherlands ASML, well known for its lithography machines to create many chips. It has a big ecosystem in the Netherlands, and a lot of Indians are working there. We can work together because India has such a huge talent base. ASML is also discussing with the Indian govt whether it can use their machines and build a chip factory in India.It's important to balance, or you can very easily over-regulate. But there should be safeguards that AI is reliable.India has a special relationship with Russia and as PM Narendra Modi said, he wants peace, just as we do. So maybe he can use that special relationship. We are not putting pressure on India, we are putting pressure on Russia, and we want them to end the war.First, we are in the process of having no energy from Russia at all and probably will reach that point in one or two years. There are some other countries that are still using oil from Russia. We put pressure on them because oil is one of the main incomes for Russia.","Outgoing pm of the netherlands, dick schoof, says he is worried over concentration of ai development.

New Delhi: India on Thursday made a clear pitch - AI must work in many languages, solve real problems, and serve societies beyond a small, privileged group, and got leaders of tech giants to adopt the 'New Delhi Frontier AI Impact Commitments' - a voluntary framework aimed at diffusing the benefits of AI among developing and underdeveloped countries; and the Global South.Unveiled at the AI Impact Summit by IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, the commitments bring together global frontier AI firms and Indian innovators to promote responsible, inclusive, and culturally sensitive AI. The emphasis is on real-world use rather than high-level declarations.The framework outlines two key commitments adopted on the first day of the summit.The first focuses on transparency and data. Participating organisations will publish anonymised and aggregated statistical insights on how AI is being used across sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, education and public services. The aim is to build a clearer picture of AI adoption across economies and regions, helping govts design evidence-based policies on workforce transition, skills and productivity, while also tracking how AI use evolves over time.The second commitment addresses a long-standing gap in AI - language. Most AI systems today perform best in English, with uneven results across other languages and cultural settings. Under the new framework, organisations will work to assess and improve AI performance across a wide range of languages and contexts. This includes collaborating with govts, researchers and civil society to develop datasets, benchmarks and evaluation methods for under-represented languages, particularly those spoken in the Global South.Describing the New Delhi commitments as a key outcome, Vaishnaw said the initiative was designed to link innovation with inclusion.","'new delhi frontier ai impact commitments' aimed at diffusing the benefits of ai among developing and underdeveloped countries; and the global south.

""We Can’t Be Seen As Weak"": Tharoor’s Bold Claim On Rafale Deal

NEW DELHI: Vice President CP Radhakrishnan on Thursday lamented that contributions of Indian philosophers and social reformers like Sree Narayana Guru have not been adequately recorded in international languages, which has created a gap in global academic discourse.Releasing a book on Narayana Guru by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , Radhakrishnan said “The sage who reimagined Hinduism” will take India’s heritage to a global audience.The VP said that the book is special because it was first released in Sivagiri Mutt, the hermitage founded by the Guru. He said a visit to the Mutt provides the inspiration to treat everyone with equality and dignity.Radhakrishnan said that the Guru emerged as a spiritual guide at a time when caste divisions and social discrimination were deeply entrenched in society. He noted the Guru’s immortal message “One Caste, One Religion, One God for humankind” was not only a spiritual proclamation but also a revolutionary call for equality, dignity and universal brotherhood.Tharoor said it is unfortunate that while Guru’s message has a universal resonance, he is hardly known outside Kerala . Talking about Kerala of the 19th century, he said that caste prejudices were so deep in the state that Swami Vivekananda had called it a “lunatic asylum”.He said Guru took up social reform in such a bad situation and shook up society to the point that Kerala is now the most progressive state in the country.","Vice president cp radhakrishnan releases a book on narayana guru by congress mp shashi tharoor.

Nitai Roy Chowdhury, 77, lone Hindu minister in prime minister Tarique Rahman-led govt and vice-chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party's central committee, said his administration was committed to ensuring the safety of all minorities and restoring cordial relations with India, asserting that fundamentalism would not be allowed to spread in Bangladesh.Chowdhury spoke toin an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by Rahman. He was also among the only four candidates from minority communities, all from BNP, who won in the February 12 elections .Among the 25 newly elected members of National Parliament from BNP who took oath as ministers alongside the newly sworn-in PM, Chowdhury, a party veteran, won from Magura-2 constituency with 1.47 lakh votes, defeating Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami's Mustarshid Billah, who secured 1.17 lakh votes.Referring to the state of governance he inherited, Chowdhury said the previous govt led by Sheikh Hasina had left the country's institutions in tatters. ""Almost everything was in disorder,"" he said, adding that after being elected to form the new govt, it was their duty to bring the country back on track. He said the BNP did not want to indulge in criticism of the past but aimed to move forward with new hopes and dreams to put Bangladesh on the path of development.Explaining what he meant by institutional damage, Chowdhury alleged that when Hasina fled Bangladesh in 2024, the country was ""completely broken"". He claimed the biggest damage was done to the education system, alleging that it had become policy under Awami League to pass 98% of students in examinations irrespective of merit. ""It was done to falsely show that the literacy rate of Bangladesh was increasing along with the passing percentage of students,"" he said.He also accused the previous regime of damaging the country's cultural fabric. During the Awami League govt, he said, ""all sorts of obscene dance and music along with hooliganism were encouraged while pushing our actual cultural values on the backburner."" He said the new govt would work to repair these pillars while upholding the ethos of unity in diversity, which he claimed had been ruined.On apprehensions regarding the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, amid incidents such as the brutal killing of Dipu Chandra Das and concerns over rising fundamentalism, Chowdhury pointed to what he described as a significant turnout of Hindu voters in the recent elections. He said such turnout was not witnessed in other communities and reflected a shift in political thinking.""Hindus realised that they cannot be treated as mere vote-bank by any party in Bangladesh. They felt that they are an inseparable part of this Bangladesh,"" Chowdhury said, adding that members of the community had businesses, properties and livelihood in the country, with their children studying in local schools, which they could not leave overnight.He said the PM and other BNP leaders met Hindu voters before the elections to assure them of safety and security. ""They realised that they too are independent citizens of this country with equal rights to life and livelihood as mentioned in our constitution. Hence, they voted in large numbers for the BNP, for which we are grateful,"" he said.Chowdhury said most political parties had now realised the importance of Hindus in electoral politics, noting that their support was crucial in at least 80 of the total 297 constituencies in National Parliament. He said that earlier the majority of Hindu voters had supported Awami League, but after its leaders fled the country in 2024, many felt insecure. He credited Rahman with working to remove that fear and win their support.On ties with India, which had taken a hit during the interim govt led by Mohammed Yunus following the toppling of Sheikh Hasina govt in 2024, Chowdhury said it was the new administration's duty to develop good relations with all neighbours, including India. ""We want to have ties which have mutual respect, interest, and understanding,"" he said.""We will work on issues related to internal security of both Bangladesh and India, because we believe that will make a strong base for mutual respect between the two,"" he added.As culture minister, Chowdhury said Bengali culture was rich and that Bangladesh had cultural ties with at least 48 countries, including India. He said the govt would strengthen these ties by focusing on traditions followed by previous generations while fighting fundamentalism and anti-cultural elements. ""We all together will work for a better Bangladesh,"" he said.","Chowdhury spoke toin an exclusive interview over phone after taking oath as culture minister along with 48 other members, including state ministers, in the cabinet headed by rahman.
