Internal issues External interference

NEW DELHI: A day after a deadly terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam rocked Jammu and Kashmir , Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif distanced Islamabad from the bloodshed, describing the violence as “home-grown” and part of a wider rebellion against India.Asif’s remarks, made during an interview with Pakistan’s Live 92 news channel, came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short a high-profile visit to Saudi Arabia to return home following the killing of 28 people at the Baisaran meadow near Pahalgam. While New Delhi has yet to officially point fingers, Asif launched a counter-offensive.“Pakistan has no connection with this,” he insisted. “There are revolutions in so-called Indian states, from Nagaland to Kashmir, in Chhattisgarh, Manipur, and the south. These are not acts of foreign interference but local uprisings.”The statement sharply diverges from New Delhi’s longstanding position that cross-border terrorism , particularly from groups allegedly backed by Pakistan, fuels unrest in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Asif doubled down, saying, “These are people asking for their rights. Hindutva forces are repressing minorities, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, and people are reacting.”With emotions running high after the attack that targeted unarmed tourists, Asif attempted to shift the narrative by accusing India of meddling in Pakistan’s internal affairs. “India is sponsoring unrest in Balochistan. We’ve presented evidence multiple times, not once, but repeatedly, of India’s hand behind instability in Pakistan,” he said.While Asif claimed Pakistan opposes terrorism “under any circumstances,” he suggested India’s treatment of its own citizens was leading to armed resistance. “If the army or police are committing atrocities against people denied fundamental rights, blaming Pakistan becomes a convenient excuse.”There was no immediate response from the Indian government to Asif’s provocative comments, which come at a sensitive time with security tensions already heightened.",Pakistan's defence minister khawaja asif distanced islamabad from the bloodshed.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday rattled Pakistan amid strong signals of a buildup to a Pulwama-type retaliation, or even a stronger response, to avenge the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 innocent people.The stage was set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who echoed the anger of the nation when he declared that ""India will identify, track, and punish every terrorist and their backers"" and will ""pursue them to the ends of the Earth"" to punish them ""beyond their imagination.""The Prime Minister's strong message was followed by a slew of countermeasures to convey a clear message to Pakistan for its support of cross-border terrorism.These moves followed five key decisions that were announced a day earlier on Wednesday and included:In 2019, India had struck terrorist camp in Balakot with airstrikes deep inside Pakistan. This after at least 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in Pulwama. Earlier in 2016, India had carried out ""surgical strikes"" targeting terror launch pads after the Uri attack in which 19 Indian soldiers were killed.The brutality of the attack in Pahalgam left the country in shock and anger. Kashmir valley witnessed an unprecedented display of public sentiment with a widespread spontaneous protests against the killings.India's strong buildup to a possible retaliatory action left Pakistan rattled and it announced several face-saving measures.Islamabad has also said any attempt to divert the water meant for it under the Indus Waters Treaty will be considered an Act of War. But India is determined to punish the Pahalgam attackers and those backing them. The government has the backing of all opposition parties in its fight against terrorism and India's response is likely to be ""loud and clear"" as Union defence minister Rajnath Singh had said yesterday.","Visa services to pakistani nationals stopped with immediate effect.

Pak hold on Simla Agreement signals shift away from peaceful resolution of disputes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-hold-on-simla-agreement-signals-shift-from-peaceful-resolution-of-disputes/articleshow/120594276.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

What stood out in Pakistan’s list of countermeasures against India’s Pahalgam offensive was its decision to put on hold the iconic 1972 Simla Agreement , along with all other bilateral agreements. Attempting a tit-for-tat over the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty a day earlier by India, Pakistan announced that it will exercise the right to hold the agreements in abeyance till India desists from “its manifested behaviour of fomenting terrorism inside Pakistan; trans-national killings; and non-adherence to international law and UN Resolutions on Kashmir”.Signed in July 1972 between then PM Indira Gandhi and President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, after Pakistan’s comprehensive defeat in the Bangladesh war, the agreement was expected to lay the foundation of a peaceful and stable relationship between the 2 countries. Importantly for India, it stressed the importance of bilateralism and use of peaceful means in resolving disputes and differences, superseding the UN resolutions on Kashmir that Pakistan again referred to, while also underlining the sanctity of the Line of Control (LOC).The fact there has been only 1 limited war in Kargil since the agreement, unlike the 3 wars that preceded it, could perhaps be cited in favour of the usefulness of the agreement. However, as far as India is concerned now, Pakistan showed little respect for the agreement as it worked overtime to internationalize the Kashmir issue, particularly after the special status of J&K was revoked in 2019, and promoted cross-border terrorism . Precluding any external intervention, particularly by major powers like the US in the Kashmir dispute , was an important element of India’s foreign policy then, as it continues to be now. Both sides also committed to non-interference in each other’s internal affairs in the agreement.According to former diplomat Syed Akbaruddin, Pakistan’s announcement signals that the agreement to address bilateral differences peacefully is no longer being considered by Pakistan as a binding commitment. “It opens up the validity of the LoC which both sides have abided by since 1971. As a corollary, it may free each side of the commitment not to unilaterally alter the LoC irrespective of differences and legal interpretations,’’ says Akbaruddin, who served in Pakistan from 1998 to 2000.According to the Simla Agreement, the LoC resulting from the ceasefire of December 1971 had to be respected by both sides “without prejudice” to the recognized positions of either side. “Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations. Both sides further undertake to refrain from the threat or the use of force in violation of this Line,’’ it said.Ironically, any move away from bilateralism by Pakistan can also serve the interests of those in India who want the PoK issue settled militarily. If Pakistan doesn’t commit to abiding by any peaceful resolution achieved bilaterally, there won’t be restraints on India too. The Modi government, however, has officially underscored the principle of resolving disputes through bilateral negotiations and in 2015, it insisted on calling a short-lived dialogue mechanism comprehensive bilateral dialogue instead of just comprehensive dialogue, to preclude the possibility of any third-party mediation.As former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria notes in his book Anger Management, after raising the prospects of an eventual settlement of the Kashmir dispute in the Simla negotiations, Bhutto quickly retracted his position. Only a year later, in 1973, as Pakistan’s new PM under a new Constitution, Bhutto started to talk about waging a 1000-year-old war with India. “By mid-1974, neither Bhutto nor Indira Gandhi had the political will or capital to forge a lasting settlement,’’ says Bisaria.","Signed in july 1972 between then pm indira gandhi and president zulfikar ali bhutto, the agreement was expected to lay the foundation of a peaceful and stable relationship between the 2 countries. Pakistan’s announcement signals that the agreement to address bilateral differences peacefully is no longer being considered by pakistan as a binding commitment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120594737,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-747306,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How does the Indus Waters Treaty works?



Why was the treaty needed?



How will Indus Water Treaty suspension impact Pakistan?



The Indus River network, comprising the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, serves as Pakistan's principal water resource, supporting a population of tens of millions.

The treaty will impact Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan, especially in the provincesof Punjab and Sindh.

Pakistan relies substantially on this water supply for irrigation, farming and potable water.

The agricultural sector contributes 23% to Pakistan's national income and supports 68% of its rural inhabitants.

The Indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.

Any interruption to water flow would significantly impact Pakistan's agricultural sector, a crucial component of its economy and rural livelihoods.

Reduced water availability will likely lead to lower crop yields, food shortages, and economic instability in rural areas dependent on farming.

Pakistan already faces critical water management issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity.

issues such as groundwater depletion, salinization of agricultural lands, and limited water storage capacity. The country’s water storage capacity is low, with major dams like Mangla and Tarbela having a combined live storage of only about 14.4 MAF, which is just 10% of Pakistan’s annual water share under the treaty.

The suspension exacerbates these vulnerabilities by cutting off a guaranteed water supply, leaving Pakistan with fewer options to manage its water needs.

This move was one of five major decisions made during a Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed on September 19, 1960, between India and Pakistan, is seen as a key example of cross-border water-sharing.It was brokered by the World Bank after nine years of talks and signed by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan’s President Ayub Khan to manage shared rivers.According to the agreement, India has control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan gets the waters from the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.The treaty benefits Pakistan as it receives about 80% of the total water flow from these rivers, which are vital for agriculture in Pakistan , especially in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh.Follow | Pahalgam Terror Attack Live According to the World Bank, the treaty set up a framework for fair and cooperative management of the Indus River system , which is essential for agriculture, drinking water, and industry in both India and Pakistan.It outlined clear guidelines for the equitable sharing of the river and its tributaries to ensure both nations could meet their water needs.The treaty gave India control over the eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—while Pakistan was given the western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab.However, both countries are allowed limited use of the rivers assigned to the other for specific purposes like irrigation and power generation.When British India was divided in 1947, the Indus River system—which starts in Tibet and flows through both India and Pakistan, also touching parts of Afghanistan and China—became a source of tension.In 1948, India temporarily stopped the flow of water to Pakistan, leading Pakistan to raise the issue with the United Nations. The UN recommended involving a neutral third party, prompting the World Bank to step in and mediate.After years of negotiations, the Indus Water Treaty was finally signed in 1960 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistani President Ayub Khan to peacefully manage and share the vital river system.Also read: 5 big CCS decisions taken by India following Pahalgam terror attack The treaty's suspension would considerably affect Pakistan, as this agreement regulates the usage and allocation of water from the Indus River system and its tributaries, which are essential for Pakistan's water requirements and agricultural sector.","The indus river network, comprising the jhelum, chenab, ravi, beas, and sutlej rivers, serves as pakistan's principal water resource. The indus basin supplies 154.3 million acre-feet of water yearly, which is vital for irrigating extensive agricultural areas and ensuring food security.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120558448,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45014,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Pakistan 'Trained' 2 J&K Locals For Pahalgam Attack, 3 Terrorists Came From Across Border | Report

A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi on Thursday, shortly after India served a persona non grata notice to Pakistani military diplomats in the wake of Pahalgam terror attack.A video doing round on social media, showed the individual being confronted by reporters who questioned the nature of celebrations, refused to comment and hurried past media personnel.Meanwhile, Delhi police removed barricades placed near the Pakistan High Commission.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","A man allegedly carrying a cake was spotted entering the pakistan high commission in delhi on thursday.

SRINAGAR: An all-party meeting convened Thursday by Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Pahalgam massacre adopted a resolution condemning the barbaric act and supporting the measures taken by Union govt to bring the perpetrators to justice. The resolution termed the brutal killings an “assault on Kashmiriyat and the idea of India”While expressing shock and grief over the loss of 26 innocent lives in the terror attack , the resolution also hailed the “supreme sacrifice” of pony guide Syed Adil Hussain Shah, and lauded the Kashmiri people for their “extraordinary display of moral and material support to all the tourists” across the Valley.The resolution called upon all sections of society across the country to maintain peace and not give in to provocations, while urging govts of other states and UTs to ensure Kashmiris residing or travelling there were “safeguarded against any form of harassment, discrimination, or intimidation”.At the outset, a two-minute silence was observed by all the participants to pay tributes to the victims.Reading out the resolution at a press conference after the all-party meeting, Omar said: “We unequivocally condemn in the strongest possible terms the heinous, inhumane attack in Pahalgam that targeted and killed innocent civilians. Such cowardly acts of brutality against peaceful citizens have no place in society and are a direct assault on the values of Kashmiriyat and the idea of India, which have long been a symbol of unity, peace and harmony in the region.”“We stand unwavering in our commitment to support all efforts in bringing these perpetrators to justice. In doing so, we affirm that no act of terror can ever weaken our resolve or extinguish our indomitable spirit,” the resolution said.Extending condolences to the families that have suffered loss, the resolution also saluted the “valour and selflessness” of the slain pony guide. “He is a true face of Kashmiriyat and Kashmir hospitality,” Omar said.The Kashmiri people’s “resolute unity in condemning the recent attack” and the spontaneous, peaceful demonstrations across J&K exemplified their “unwavering commitment to peace, communal harmony and the rule of law”, and reaffirmed their “collective resolve to foster mutual respect, uphold constitutional values, and work collaboratively for the prosperity and stability of J&K”, the resolution further stated.","An all-party meeting convened by jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah on pahalgam massacre adopted a resolution condemning the barbaric act.

'Uncontested polls now rare': EC urges SC to junk NGO plea

NEW DELHI: Election Commission and the Centre Thursday told Supreme Court that SC's 2013 mandate to provide the option of NOTA to voters had turned out to be a ""failed idea"" and that it was preposterous for a PIL to insist on conducting polls even in the rare instance of there being only a single candidate in the fray to know whether she/he secures more votes than NOTA.Appearing for EC, advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told SC, ""NOTA... never impacted any election as a minuscule of voters exercised this option. Every winning candidate got far higher votes than NOTA.""Attorney general R Venkataramani, with additional solicitor general S D Sanjay, said govt concurred with EC.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""Can the Union govt and EC deliberate on prescribing a minimum vote percentage benchmark for winning candidates?""Govt may think of constituting an expert body comprising parliamentarians and domain experts to discuss this issue. Since our Constitution provides for a democracy by majority, is it not desirable that the winning candi-date secures a threshold vote percentage, which would be fixed by Parliament,"" the bench said.Venkataramani said this issue was deliberated upon at length by EC which gave a report on 'one nation one poll'. The recommendations were debated by parliamentarians and there were divergent views, he said.Justice Kant said this may be a hypothetical issue - a single candidate in the fray may secure less votes than Nota in case an election was held instead of declaring that candidate elected unopposed.In its affidavit, EC said a candidate getting elected unopposed from a Lok Sabha constituency was very rare. Since 1991, there was only a single such instance of a candidate getting elected to Lok Sabha unopposed, Dwivedi said. ""Since 1971 till today, that is in the last 54 years, there have been six uncontested elections in total. In the 20 general elections since 1951, there have been only nine uncontested elections,"" he added.Responding to the PIL by NGO 'Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy' seeking conduct of election even when there was only a single candidate in the fray, EC said, ""With the evolution of democracy, a greater number of political parties are contesting elections and, hence, the number of candidates also increases automatically, and voters have become more aware and eager to exercise their right to vote.""The chance of the election being uncontested has become a rarity which is proven from statistical data and, hence, in such a scenario, SC ought not to entertain the present petition.""Nota option is there only when there is an election, EC said, adding, ""Hence, treating Nota as a mandatorily contesting candidate in all direct uncontested elections does not find place in the statute and the same would require legislative amendments in the provisions of Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.""","'uncontested polls now rare': ec urges sc to junk ngo plea.
