AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

New Delhi: As Republic Day celebrations drew to a close with the Beating Retreat ceremony, Vijay Chowk reverberated with three of composer AR Rahman's iconic songs - Oscar-winning 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam'.Earlier this month, when asked about his absence from Hindi-film music during an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman said, ""It might be a communal thing also... but it is not in my face"". He later said that intentions could be ""misundersood sometimes"" and that he was grateful to the country.While the Central Armed Police Forces band performed ""Jai Ho"", the Indian Navy band played 'Bharat humko...'.The song 'Aarambh hai prachand' from the movie Gulaal was played by the Indian Army band. Vande Mataram on its 150th anniversary and Operation Sindoor were featured prominently during the ceremony on Thursday evening, which was presided over by President Droupadi Murmu, who arrived in the ceremonial buggy. Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi , defence minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the three service chiefs were also present.The bands stood various formations that included 'Amar Jawan': a tribute to Indian Army bravehearts, 'Deva Vyuha: a battle formation referred to in Mahabharata battle formation against Bhishm Pitamah and 'Ardhachandra Vyuha': a half-moon battle formation.LED screens placed at the venue also showed a video clip of a BrahMos missile hitting a target; instruments of several band members were wrapped with LEDs on which the logo of Op Sindoor shone. Images of Rafale, Tejas, Su-30, BrahMos, S-400 air defence system, Netra, Prachand and C-130 also played on the screens.Later, the PM shared the glimpses from Beating Retreat 2026, saying that ""performances by the various bands were memorable"".In a series of posts on X, Modi said: ""Air Force Band was exceptional... They performed 'Brave Warrior', 'Twilight', 'Alert (Post Horn Gallop)' and 'Flying Star' impeccably. The Sindoor formation was brilliant!""On the naval band, he posted, ""Simply outstanding! The Naval Band's performances included 'Namaste', 'Sagar Pawan', 'Matribhumi', 'Tejasvi' and 'Jai Bharati'. The Matsya Yantra formation was flawless.""","Vijay chowk reverberated with three of composer ar rahman's iconic songs.

New Delhi: SC agreed and suggested to states to take legislative measures to protect domestic helps from exploitation, but refused to issue a direction for the adoption of minimum wages, apprehending that it would make families wary of taking their services because of the fear of being dragged to court by workers' unions, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.The court took a dim view of the role of trade unions, saying that they had, in fact, hurt the interests of workers. ""Just to get popularity such petitions are filed by so-called trade union leaders. Do you know how many industries in India were closed because of the activities of unions?

MCX Gold, on the weekly timeframe, continues to demonstrate healthy bullish momentum following a decisive breakout from a brief consolidation phase and is presently trading near its all-time high of 164,900. The upside bias is firmly established, with minimal evidence of a trend reversal, indicating that the advance is likely to stay toward higher levels. The recent acceleration further confirms the strength and sustainability of the move, while the broader outlook remains constructive as long as prices sustain above the weekly low.From a weekly perspective, the 157,500 zone emerges as a key support level, representing the recent lows of the previous week. Any retracement toward this area is likely to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this level preserves the bullish market structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well poised to advance toward the 185,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective upside is in harmony with the broader bullish trend and underlines the strength of prevailing market momentum.Additionally, the development of higher highs and higher lows over the week further reinforces positive sentiment, setting the stage for a sustained upward trajectory.Overall, gold maintains an optimistic bias, with the broader technical framework decisively favouring trend continuation. As long as prices remain firmly above the critical 157,500 support level, the bullish formation remains intact. Supported by robust momentum indicators and a favourable market sentiment backdrop, the metal appears well positioned to extend its advance in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has registered new all-time highs for the fifth consecutive week, extending a well-established sequence of higher highs that has persisted for several months. With little evidence of momentum decline, the overall bias remains decisively positive, and any corrective pullbacks are likely to attract renewed buying interest. We recommend positioning in line with the prevailing trend, which remains firmly bullish, while refraining from positions that go against this strong upward momentum.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a resurgence in trend strength, enhancing the prospects for additional upside. Provided prices continue to hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support is located around the 340,000 zone, which may offer an attractive accumulation opportunity. Any retracement toward this area is likely to draw fresh buying interest, helping to stabilize prices and preserve upward momentum.On the upside, silver appears well positioned to test the 415,000 resistance over the near to medium term. This anticipated move reflects a continuation of the current bullish phase, supported by strong momentum and favourable technical indicators. Overall, provided prices remain firmly anchored above the 340,000 support level, silver is expected to maintain its bullish trend, with considerable scope for further appreciation as bullish sentiment continues to strengthen.","Mcx gold, on the weekly timeframe, continues to demonstrate healthy bullish momentum following a decisive breakout.

Supreme Court Halts New UGC Equity Regulations On Caste Definition, Seeks Centre’s Reply By March

Here's what the Supreme Court said:

""We are simply examining it on the threshold of constitutionality and legality.""

""The language needs to be re-modified,"" the court said.

""We want free, equitable and inclusive atmosphere in educational institutions.""

""Unity of India must be reflected in our educational institutions.""

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the University Grant Commission's (UGC) new set of rules aimed at promoting equality in higher education institutions (HEI) amid nationwide protests over the legislation's controversial definition of discrimination.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi issued notices to the Centre and the UGC on the pleas challenging the regulation.The new UGC regulations, notified on January 23, were challenged by various petitioners as being arbitrary, exclusionary, discriminatory and in violation of the Constitution as well as the University Grants Commission Act, 1956.The plea assailed the regulations on the grounds that caste-based discrimination was defined strictly as discrimination against SC, ST and OBC community members. It said that by limiting the scope only to these categories, UGC had effectively denied institutional protection and grievance redress to individuals belonging to the “general” or non-reserved categories, who may also face harassment based on their caste identity.The top court said that, for now, the 2012 UGC regulations will continue to apply. The court opined that there is complete vagueness in Regulation 3 (C) (which defines caste-based discrimination), and it can be misused.Earlier on Wednesday, students, mostly belonging to the general category, staged a protest at Delhi University's North Campus against the newly notified University Grants Commission (UGC) equity rules, demanding their immediate withdrawal.The protesting students claimed that the rules promote discrimination on campuses instead of equality. They pointed out that there was no binding provision for the representation of general category students.Earlier, Shyam Sundar Tripathi, Vice President of the BJP Kisan Morcha from the Salon constituency in Rae Bareli, had resigned from his post, citing dissatisfaction over new UGC policies. Tripathi announced his resignation in a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Due to the black law, like the reservation bill, brought against the children of the upper caste, I am resigning from my post. This law is extremely dangerous for society and also divisive. I am completely dissatisfied with the bill. There is great resentment. I do not support this reservation bill. Supporting such an unethical bill is completely against my self-respect and ideology,"" read the letter written in Hindi.","Supreme court halts new ugc equity regulations on caste definition, seeks centre’s reply by march.

Inside the meeting

What wasn't discussed: CM face

NEW DELHI: After weeks of visible discomfort, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi finally met the senior leader Shashi Tharoor on Thursday.The PTI sources described it as a detailed ""redressal"" meeting ahead of the crucial Kerala assembly polls.The meeting, held in Kharge's chamber in the Parliament House complex, lasted for over an hour and forty-five minutes and came amid party concerns that the Tharoor episode could snowball into a larger messaging problem in Kerala, where Congress is pushing hard to return to power after a decade in opposition.Emerging from the meeting, Tharoor struck a deliberately upbeat tone. ""We had a discussion with my two party leaders, the LoP and the Congress president. We had a very good, constructive, positive discussion,"" he told reporters. Shutting down recent speculations, he said, ""All is good and we are moving together on the same page. What more can I say.""Sources told news agency PTI that it was a ""comprehensive"" meeting in which ""a wide array of subjects were covered"" and that Kharge and Gandhi made ""the time necessary for a thorough discussion.""Tharoor later reinforced the truce with a post on X, thanking both leaders for a ""warm and constructive discussion"" and repeating the now-official line that they were ""all on the same page"" as the party moves forward ""in the service of the people of India.""A photo from the meeting showing Tharoor, Rahul and Kharge smiling was also put out on social media.Asked if the issue of the chief ministerial face for Kerala was discussed, Tharoor attempted to close that door firmly.""That was never the issue,"" he said, adding: ""I am not interested in being the candidate for anything. At the moment I am already an MP ... I have their interest to look after in Parliament, that is my job.""The meeting comes after Tharoor was reportedly upset about the treatment meted out to him at a recent Kochi event and what his camp saw as attempts by some state leaders to sideline him. The immediate tipping point, sources close to him had said, was Rahul Gandhi allegedly not acknowledging Tharoor on stage at the 'Maha Panchayath' in Kochi on January 19, even while mentioning other leaders. Tharoor, a four-time MP and one of the Congress Working Committee members from Kerala, was present on the dais.Soon after, he skipped a key Kerala strategy meeting chaired by Kharge, triggering speculation that internal tensions were deepening at precisely the wrong moment.Congress is seeking to wrest power from the Left after 10 years in opposition.In that backdrop, the last thing the leadership can afford is the spectacle of internal rivalries, especially when the BJP is also attempting to expand its footprint and the LDF remains organisationally tight.A senior Congress source told PTI: the ""proof of the pudding will be in the eating"" and the next few weeks will show whether the ""same page"" line translates into actual political coordination.","Congress president mallikarjun kharge and lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi finally met the senior leader shashi tharoor on thursday.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new h-1b stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday refused to walk back from his remarks on ""Miya Muslims"" after the criticism by the opposition.A day after the chief minister said that he encourages troubling the ""Miyan"" to drive them back from the state, Sarma clarified that the word was used to refer the illegal Muslim migrants from Bangladesh. He also cited the Supreme Court to claim that the issue is a ""grave and long-standing problem that Assam has lived with for decades.""In a social media post on X, Sarma said, ""Those who are attacking me for my remarks on “Miyan”—a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration—should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam. This is not my language, not my imagination, and not political exaggeration.""“The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of the geostrategically vital districts of lower Assam… The influx of illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region… It will then only be a matter of time when a demand for their merger with Bangladesh may be made… Loss of lower Assam will sever the entire land mass of the North East from the rest of India and the rich natural resources of that region will be lost to the Nation,"" Himanta cited a Supreme Court observation.""Our effort is not against any religion or any Indian citizen. Our effort is to protect Assam’s identity, security, and future, exactly as the Supreme Court cautioned the nation to do. Ignoring that warning would be the real injustice—to Assam and to India,"" he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Himanta had said that he encourages creating “trouble” for “Miyan Muslims” so that they are driven out of the state, remarks that have sparked widespread outrage across the election-bound northeastern state.“Trouble the Miyan Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam. If I want to give trouble to Miya, I go at 12 am. It’s not an issue. We are directly against the Miya Muslims,"" Himanta had said.""We are not hiding anything; we directly say that we are against Miyans. Earlier, people feared that notices would be served against them. Now, I encourage everyone to give trouble to Miyan. Yesterday, I saw that they have reached Duliajan. A tsunami will happen here, but the result will be in Pakistan,” he added.His remarks drew strong criticism from Opposition leaders, who warned that such statements could have serious consequences for social harmony.Congress leader Udit Raj said the Assam chief minister’s remarks would not go down well with the public and could even lead to “civil war”.“Congress neither works for Bengali Muslims nor for Bengali Hindus. Congress views everyone as a citizen. It is good that what was once done covertly, Himanta Biswa Sarma has now openly stated,' the Congress leader told news agency IANS.CPI(M) MP Amraram also condemned the comments, accusing the Assam government of using administrative exercises to marginalise vulnerable communities.""This is what the chief minister always does. In the name of SIR, votes are being taken away from Dalits, minorities, SCs, and STs. Even when people are not being divided on the basis of Hindu or Muslim, votes are being manipulated in the name of SIR. All of these people are citizens of this country, whether Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Christian, or Buddhist.

NEW DELHI: MGNREGA will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the Modi govt during the budget session of Parliament, with its demand for the rural job scheme’s restoration likely to trigger stormy exchanges in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.Opposition INDIA bloc, which held a coordination meeting in the chamber of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday ahead of the start of the session, also decided to fully participate in the session which includes the Union budget and the Motion of Thanks to the President’s joint address. The special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is another issue on the opposition’s agenda.In the strategy discussions, attended by Rahul Gandhi, DMK’s TR Baalu, RSP’s NK Premachandran, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Arvind Sawant, SP’s Javed Ali Khan, CPM’s John Brittas, CPI’s P Sandosh, Congress’s KC Venugopal, Kodikunnil Suresh, Manickam Tagore, RJD’s Prem Chand Gupta, among others, the leaders decided to mark their protest over the job scheme as President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Wednesday mentioned VB-GRAMG that will replace MGNREGA. TMC did not attend the discussions.When the President’s speech mentioned the VB-GRAMG scheme, opposition MPs stood up and raised slogans. While the action riled the govt into slamming the opposition, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said, “Today during the President’s address, all opposition parties most respectfully and in a dignified manner protested the bulldozed repeal of MGNREGA. The opposition will use all democratic means to demand the restoration of MGNREGA.If the statement made clear the opposition’s intent to make the job scheme the front and centre of its parliamentary agenda, the same scenes may be witnessed during the presentation of the Union budget.The reason behind the focus on MGNREGA seems to be the upcoming five assembly elections and the unanimity among the parties on the issue. The belief among the opposition parties is that the disbanding of the job scheme poses a serious threat to the availability of distress employment for the poor in the future because of the shifting of a considerable financial burden on the states under VB-GRAMG.Since the subject would automatically become part of the discussion on the Union budget and then also figure in debate on the motion of thanks, it would provide ample opportunity to the rivals to amplify concerns and target BJP.However, there is some uncertainty in the INDIA bloc over its decision to focus on MGNREGA and to participate in the session, in view of what TMC may do after it comes to Parliament in the coming days, after the initial absence. The Mamata Banerjee outfit has in the past forced the hands of other allies with independent action.",Mgnrega will be the opposition’s principal issue to target the modi govt during the budget session of parliament.

Bangladesh Leader’s Seven Sisters Remark Triggers Diplomatic Row, India Summons Envoy Issues Warning

Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of Indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against Indian establishments in Bangladesh, Dhaka on Wednesday shrugged off New Delhi’s concerns, saying it is their “choice” and “not our concern”. “If they want to take their families back, it is not our concern. There is no security concern. I do not understand what signal is being sent. It is their decision,” Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said.The advisory was issued last week following massive anti-India protests near the Indian high commission in Dhaka and assistant high commissions in other cities — angry protests had come precariously close to the diplomatic facility in Chittagong — as well as a series of attacks on minority Hindus, including killings, since the death of radical Islamist leader and India-baiter Sharif Osman Hadi on Dec 18, six days after he was shot.“There is no situation in the country that would compel diplomats to send their family members back home or where officials or their family members are in danger,” Touhid said, adding he sees “no justification for the reported non-family posting of Indian diplomats”. He told reporters that the Bangladesh govt has not been informed of any security concerns regarding the family members of Indian diplomats.While the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and its missions have suspended visa operations, the Indian high commission in Dhaka and its missions continue to remain open.",India advised family members of indian diplomats and officials to return amid threat of violence against indian establishments in bangladesh.

Hyderabad: PM Modi Wednesday urged global aviation companies and investors to partner with India in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, advanced air mobility and aircraft leasing, as the country consolidates its position as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market and pushes into a new phase of aviation-led growth, reports Swati Bharadwaj.In a recorded video message at the inaugural session of Wings India 2026, Modi said few countries offer India’s combination of scale, political stability and technological ambition. “I invite investors from around the world to join us as co-pilots on India’s flight to success,” the PM added.Modi stressed the need for self-reliance in aviation and pointed to efforts to build domestic capability in aircraft design and manufacturing. He said India is moving from being a parts supplier to making military and transport aircraft.","Pm modi urges global aviation companies and investors to partner with india in aircraft manufacturing, pilot training, advanced air mobility and aircraft leasing.

Parliament Erupts As President Mentions VB-G RAM G Act, Opposition Slams Move To Replace MGNREGA

New Delhi: With acrimony between govt and opposition benches often leading to disruption in Parliament, President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said issues like national security and resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’ should be beyond any differences and asked MPs from across the political divide to speak in one voice on matters of national interest.In her address to a joint sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to mark the Budget session’s start, she invoked a number of leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, identified with contesting ideologies to assert that they stood for burying differences for the country’s interest.The resolve for ‘Viksit Bharat’, India’s security, self-reliance and swadeshi were the issues over which Parliament should be unanimous as it was accepted that nothing was bigger than the nation despite difference of opinions, she said, while also invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia, Sardar Patel and Deen Dayal Upadhyay.Her lauding of the VB-G RAM G law, which replaces MGNREGA, saying it would eliminate corruption and boost rural development, drew protests from opposition members, who called for its rollback while BJP and its allies thumped their desks in praise of the new scheme.The opposition was also heard protesting when Murmu began her speech, prompting parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju to later accuse them of insulting revered figures she mentioned.Congress charged him with spreading lies, saying it was only demanding MGNREGA restoration. The prospect of another showdown looms large as the opposition has sought to revive debate over SIR and VB-G RAM G, with Rijiju ruling out the possibility.In her address, which is prepared by govt, Murmu lauded the governing dispensation for its firm response to Pakistan-linked terrorism with Operation Sindoor, decisive action against Maoist terror, working for the uplift of backward communities, and for ensuring that Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy despite global challenges.“India has proved that power can be used with responsibility and wisdom. My govt sent a strong message that any terrorist attack on India will receive a firm and decisive response,” she said. Maoist terror, she noted, once affected 126 districts but had receded to eight.PM Narendra Modi described her address as inspiring, comprehensive and insightful, saying it reflected India’s remarkable development journey in recent times. “The emphasis on building a Viksit Bharat was perfectly captured, reflecting our shared aspiration of building a strong and self-reliant nation. The address also covered a wide range of themes, highlighting sustained efforts for farmers, youth, the poor and the downtrodden. It reaffirmed our collective commitment to further speed up the ‘reform express’ and the emphasis on innovation and good governance,” he said.Murmu also referred to the free trade agreement India has signed with EU, saying it would boost manufacturing and service sectors and create new employment opportunities for the youth.","President droupadi murmu said national security and resolve for ‘viksit bharat’ should be beyond any differences.

'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the “historic” free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the European Union in Delhi a day before is a “global gamechanger” and will open countless opportunities for lakhs of Indian youths.Addressing a gathering at the annual National Cadet Corps PM Rally at Delhi Cantt here, the PM said the entire world is looking at India's youth with a “lot of trust” and the reason behind that trust is “skill and ‘sanskar’ (culture)”. He underlined that this agreement with 27 countries will benefit Indian startups by easing access to funding and innovation ecosystems, while also boosting India’s creative economy in film, gaming, fashion, digital content, music, and design. He stated that the deal will create new opportunities for Indian youth in research, education, IT, and professional services.Modi underscored it will accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign and strengthen the resolve of “Make in India, Make for the World”. He explained that under this agreement, tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports will either be zero or very low, benefiting industries such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear, engineering goods, and MSMEs.He said the deal will also bring more investment into India, leading to new engineering, electronics, chemical, pharma, and other manufacturing plants, while creating assured markets for agriculture, food processing, and fisheries, which will be a major opportunity for farmers, fishermen, and rural youth. He said this FTA directly connects India’s youth to Europe’s job market, creating opportunities especially in engineering, green technology, design, logistics, and advanced manufacturing, meaning new avenues are opening for Indian youth across 27 countries.“Before this (EU FTA), India has done FTAs with Oman, New Zealand, Britain, the UAE, Australia, and countries like Mauritius...I had addressed from the Red Fort that ‘Yahi samay hai, sahi samay hai' (this is the time, this is the right time). For the country's youth, it is a time for maximum opportunities,"" Modi said, adding, “this is not just a trade agreement. This is a new blueprint for shared prosperity”.Modi also “noted with grief that the day also brought great sorrow due to the tragic plane crash in Maharashtra this morning, which claimed the lives of Deputy CM,Shri Ajit Pawar ji and some colleagues.” He highlighted that “Ajit Dada made a significant contribution to the development of Maharashtra and the nation, especially by working to improve village life, and expressed condolences to Shri Ajit Pawar ji’s family. ” He stated that in this moment of pain, the nation stands with the families of those lost in the accident.Lauding the impressive tableau on Op Sindoor, Modi appreciated the efforts of NCC cadets during that critical moment for national security. He noted their contributions in supporting the armed forces, organising blood donation camps, and providing first-aid services.Emphasising that Op Sindoor reaffirmed India’s strength and the valour of its armed forces, Modi said it also demonstrated the advancement of indigenous weapons. He stressed that in modern warfare, the role of youth skills has increased significantly, as battles are now fought not only with tanks and guns but also in code and cloud. He warned that nations lagging in technology are weak not only in economy but also in security, and stressed that innovation by youth strengthens patriotism and contributes to national security.Modi called for a new tradition in the country, proposing that NCC, NSS, and My Young India organisation hold a grand event every Jan 25 to honour first-time voters, expressing confidence that this effort will strengthen the sense of responsibility among youth and reinforce democracy.","Pm narendra modi: india-eu fta will create countless opportunities for youth.

Patient group seeks public scrutiny of India-EU FTA ahead of signing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patient-group-seeks-public-scrutiny-of-india-eu-fta-ahead-of-signing/articleshow/127721979.cms,"'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

NW DELHI: A patient advocacy group has cautioned the government over the free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, urging it to make the full text public and place it before the Parliament for a detailed discussion, prior to its signing.The group said such scrutiny is essential to enable an informed debate on the FTA’s implications for the pharmaceutical sector. Even though the pact does not explicitly talk about patent-related provisions, it provides a high level of protection and enforcement of intellectual property (IP) rights, including copyright, trademarks, designs, trade secrets and plant variety rights.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.``The govt should clarify and ensure that the final text does not include any TRIPS-plus provisions, particularly patent term extensions and data exclusivity, which would compromise the availability of affordable medicines’’, KM Gopakumar, co-convenor, Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment told TOI.India plays an important role as a supplier of affordable generic medicines to low- and middle-income countries.Any weakening of its patent laws or regulatory framework through FTAs risks having an impact not only on patients in India, but millions worldwide who depend on Indian generic production, the group said.The agreement clearly demonstrates that India has agreed to IP protection and enforcement standards that go beyond the minimum obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). However, notably the press release (by EU) does not mention patent related provisions, nor does it clarify whether the agreement includes controversial TRIPS-plus measures such as patent term extensions, pharmaceutical data exclusivity, or other forms of market exclusivity for medicines, he added.Earlier, when negotiations were relaunched in 2022, the European Union’s proposed IP text explicitly sought patent term extension and data exclusivity protection for pharmaceutical products. In the previous rounds of negotiations, particularly during 2007-2013, India had rejected these TRIPS-plus demands following strong opposition from civil society, patent groups, and public health advocates.``We caution against repeating the approach adopted in the FTAs with EFTA and the UK that risk having a direct or indirect impact on access to affordable medicines’’, a statement from the patient advocacy group said.Further, it is also important to note that the EU–Mercosur agreement, reflects a shift away from the inclusion of patent related TRIPS-plus provisions in FTAs. This precedent should be followed in the EU-India agreement too, it added.","The working group on access to medicines and treatment said `trade secrets’ could be a challenge specifically for biologics, and overall, may have implications for data exclusivity.

Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.",Bangladesh's foreign affairs adviser md touhid hossain said that there was “no reason’ for such a move.

Offsetting impact of Trump tariffs

India and the EU have concluded discussions for a free trade agreement (FTA) that is being called the ‘mother of all deals’ by both sides. It’s a big breakthrough after 18 years of talks, and comes at a crucial juncture in the global economy which is reeling from unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump. The trade deal is expected to be signed sometime this year after the legal framework is in place and the European Parliament agrees to it.The landmark India-EU trade deal that will help ease both sides’ dependence on the United States of America, and even China. The push to wrap up negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gathered pace after tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday described the India-European Union free trade agreement as a framework for shared prosperity that serves the broader global interest, saying the partnership with Europe would reinforce international stability at a time of growing uncertainty in the world order.He addressed a joint press conference with European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen following the conclusion of negotiations on the India-EU FTA and the summit meeting between the two sides.The European Union is India’s biggest partner in merchandise trade, with two-way goods commerce at roughly $136 billion in the year ending March 2025, according to official figures. Services exports from India to the EU reached €37 billion in 2024, nearly doubling from €19 billion in 2019, as Indian technology firms and outsourcing companies have deepened their footprint across Europe.Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the agreement between India and the European Union is expected to come into force sometime in 2026. Goyal said the agreement would now undergo expedited legal vetting. “Every agreement stands on its own legs, and this is a wonderful agreement. It'll be taken up for a legal scrubbing on a fast track basis...We do hope that we should be able to celebrate the entry into force of this agreement within calendar 2026 itself,” he said.Ahead of the trade deal announcement, the Trump administration has expressed displeasure on the FTA. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday criticised the FTA, alleging that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine conflict by purchasing energy products routed through India.Bessent argued that European countries were weakening their own security position by importing refined fuel from India that is derived from Russian crude oil. He contrasted this with Washington’s stance, which has imposed stiff tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy dealings with Moscow.In an interview with ABC News, Bessent justified the Trump administration’s tariff measures, directly linking them to India’s purchases of Russian oil. “We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,” he said.The US is among the largest markets for India’s exports and Trump’s 50% tariffs have had a major impact on its exports to America. At the start of this financial year, India’s exports to the US were $8.4 billion. They have now come down to $6.88 billion December. The decline has been drastic since August, when the 50% came into effect in a phased manner.In FY25 so, India’s total exports stood at roughly $825 billion, comprising about $438 billion in goods and $387 billion in services. Looking ahead to FY26, merchandise exports are expected to remain largely stagnant as global demand stays subdued and fresh tariff pressures from the United States weigh on shipments. Services exports, by contrast, are likely to show modest growth, edging beyond the $400 billion mark, according to an analysis by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Global trade conditions have worsened sharply. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has moved away from World Trade Organization norms, relying instead on aggressive unilateral tariffs.As a result, India’s exports to the US declined by nearly 21% between May and November 2025 amid a 50% tariff regime. Unless Washington withdraws the additional 25% levy tied to India’s purchases of Russian oil or reaches a bilateral trade agreement, shipments to India’s largest export destination could face further pressure.However, some resilience is evident. Even as exports to the US have dropped steeply, shipments to other markets increased by around 5.5% over the same period, signalling slow but steady diversification. Nevertheless, the US and the European Union continue to be India’s most critical export destinations, making disengagement neither practical nor desirable, says GTRI.Once operational, around 93% of India’s exports are set to gain duty-free entry into European markets, while Indian consumers are likely to see lower prices on premium European imports such as luxury automobiles and wines.The agreement delivers exceptional access to the European market, covering over 99% of India’s exports by value. In addition to merchandise trade, it secures substantial openings in services, supported by a mobility framework that facilitates the smooth movement of skilled Indian professionals.The India-EU FTA is set to significantly strengthen labour-intensive industries, including textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, marine products, gems and jewellery, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. Under the pact, tariffs of up to ten percent on nearly $33 billion worth of exports will be eliminated once the agreement comes into effect.The agreement would effectively create a combined market of nearly two billion people across India, the world’s fourth-largest economy, and the EU, the second-largest economic bloc globally.Together, India and the EU represent about 25% of global GDP and roughly one-third of world trade, estimated at around $11 trillion out of a global total of $33 trillion.For India, the agreement promises restored market access, tariff relief for labor-intensive exports, and new opportunities in services; for the EU, it offers scale, growth, and supply-chain diversification beyond China.As Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, notes, the India-EU trade deal is an example of ‘classic FTA economics at work’.“Because both economies specialise in different segments, tariff elimination works as a cost-reduction tool rather than a displacement shock. An India–EU FTA would thus deliver classic trade gains—higher volumes, deeper integration and stronger industrial competitiveness on both sides—at a moment when such economically rational trade arrangements are becoming increasingly rare,” says Ajay Srivastava.As GTRI notes, rather than competing with each other, the two economies occupy different positions within global value chains. India largely ships labour-intensive and processing-oriented products, while the EU specialises in capital equipment, sophisticated technologies and industrial intermediates.“This structural complementarity explains why an India–EU free trade agreement is likely to lower costs and expand trade rather than threaten domestic industry,” says GTRI.In FY2025, merchandise trade between the two sides crossed $136 billion, and reductions in tariffs would mainly ease input costs, strengthen value-chain linkages and boost trade volumes, delivering the conventional efficiency gains associated with such agreements for businesses and consumers alike.Diversification of product basket and geographies is key to mitigating the impact of US tariffs, say experts. So will the India-EU FTA deliver on that front?In a report, Emkay Research says, “...India–EU FTA comes at a crucial juncture—of global trade fragmentation, rising protectionism, US–India trade frictions, and heightened global uncertainty. The deal could act as an effective counter-cyclical buffer by improving India’s export participation in global value chains, expanding market access, and supporting supply-chain diversification.”The EU accounts for around 17% of India’s goods exports. Emkay Research estimates that a bilateral alignment could lift India’s exports to the EU by around $50 billion by 2031, led by medium-tech manufacturing.Agneshwar Sen, Trade Policy Leader at EY India tells TOI, “The India - EU FTA’s value lies beyond tariffs. It will provide predictable market access, regulatory cooperation, and investment linkages. While strengthening Indian competitiveness, it may partially mitigate the trade-distorting effects of unilateral tariff actions elsewhere.”Sen points out that the tariff concessions, while an important element under the India–EU FTA, will not provide a like-for-like offset to the adverse impact of the recent US tariff increase.“They can certainly and meaningfully cushion the shock in some sectors, but given the differences in domestic regulations in the EU as compared to the US, wholesale redirection of trade from one market to the other is unlikely to happen. The US remains India’s largest single-country export market, nonetheless deeper access to the EU—especially in engineering goods, chemicals, textiles, auto components and new-age sectors—will help diversify demand and stabilise export growth,” he adds.Gulzar Didwania, Partner at Deloitte India believes that the deal is likely to open up the EU market for India for various sectors such as textile, gems and jewellery, auto components etc. “India exports a significant amount of these items to the US which has been impacted due to 50% tariffs. While the US is India’s largest trading partner so far, this deal is likely to offset some amount of impact created by US tariffs on Indian exports,” he tells TOI.Gautam Khattar, Principal at Price Waterhouse & Co LLP says, “The EU trade deal offers a critical window for Indian exporters to diversify and de-risk supply chains. Gaining preferential access to a market of this scale is a massive catalyst for labour-intensive sectors like textiles and leather.”“In an era of rapid geopolitical shifts, this isn't just a trade agreement, it’s a strategic expansion of India’s global footprint,” he tells TOI.However, Ajay Srivastava of GTRI strikes a note of caution: “The first set of tariff cuts under the India-EU FTA may kick in after at least one year. But India’s exports to the US are already down by 21% between May and Dec 2025. We hope that a US deal may happen soon, reducing US tariffs from 50 to 15%,” he tells TOI.India is confronted with one of the most demanding global trade backdrops in recent memory. A surge in protectionist policies across developed economies, softening worldwide demand and the emergence of climate-related trade restrictions are all coming at a time when India is seeking to accelerate export growth. Instead of expansion, the near-term focus is increasingly on preserving existing market share.With this pact, the European Union becomes India’s 22nd free trade agreement partner. Since 2014, the NDA government has concluded trade agreements with Mauritius, the UAE, the UK, EFTA, Oman and Australia, and has announced deals with New Zealand. In 2025, India signed trade agreements with Oman and the UK and confirmed the conclusion of negotiations with New Zealand.","India and the eu have concluded discussions for a free trade agreement (fta) that is being called the ‘mother of all deals’ by both sides.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has softened his earlier stance on calling for a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup, admitting that the moment for such a move has passed. While ruling out a full withdrawal, the former wicketkeeper-batsman floated a different form of protest, suggesting Pakistan could take part in the tournament but decline to play fixtures against India. He stressed, however, that any such call would have to come from the Pakistani government rather than the cricket board.“If the government says we won’t play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,” Latif said. “If they don’t, that’s where the real confrontation begins.” Asked what would happen if India and Pakistan met in the final, Latif replied, “nahi khelenge’ (we won’t play)”.Latif, who had earlier urged Pakistan to boycott the World Cup to challenge what he described as India’s influence over global cricket administration, said on Wednesday that the opportunity slipped away when the Pakistan Cricket Board did not act immediately after Bangladesh were excluded from the event.“The time for a strike has passed,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind. “Every decision has a timing. When the iron is hot, that’s when you strike. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.”Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland after 14 votes went against their participation, with the ICC citing logistical and contractual issues. Pakistan backed Bangladesh in the vote but eventually went along with the final decision.“We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over,” Latif said. “If we boycott now, it won’t have the same impact.”Pakistan chairman Mohsin Naqvi had hinted earlier this week that the board could consider a principled stand similar to Bangladesh’s, but no formal announcement followed.
