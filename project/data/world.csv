What happened so far

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday expressed willingness to hold talks ""for peace"" with India, even as tensions remained high following a recent spell of military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.""We are ready to talk with it for peace,"" Shehbaz said during a visit to the Kamra air base in Pakistan's Punjab province.Top leaders and military officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu accompanied him.There, he met with officers and soldiers involved in the recent confrontation with India.However, Sharif reiterated that the ""conditions for peace"" must include addressing the long-standing Kashmir issue India has always maintained that the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are ""integral and inalienable parts"" of it.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that the only issue which remains to be discussed on Kashmir is return of part of J&K that is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan (PoK).""We are open to discussing that (return of PoK) with Pakistan. So I want you to spell out our positions very clearly. The government's position is very, very clear,"" he told media at the inauguration of the Honduras embassy.He added that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will remain strictly bilateral with a focus on cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar further called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists accused of attacking India.""That (bilateralism) has been a national consensus for years, and there is absolutely no change. The prime minister made it very clear that talks with Pakistan will be only on terror. Pakistan has a list of terrorists that needs to be handed over, and they have to shut down the terrorists’ infrastructure. They know what to do. We are prepared to discuss with them what is to be done about terrorism. Those are the talks which are feasible,"" said Jaishankar.This was Sharif's second visit to a defence facility following the understanding reached between India and Pakistan on May 10.To avenge the killings of 26 people in J&K's Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Under the operation, the armed forces targeted nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists.Pakistan then launched several missile and drone attacks on May 8, 9 and 10. Indian armed forces , in response, launched a fierce counter-attack on several Pakistani military installations, including Rafiqui, Murid, Chaklala, Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur and Chunian.","'talks with pakistan will be only on terror': jaishankar.

Desi diaspora set to take $1.6 billion hit as US plans bill to tax remittances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/desi-diaspora-set-to-take-1-6-billion-hit-as-us-plans-bill-to-tax-remittances/articleshow/121198369.cms,"A proposed US bill, dubbed 'The One Big Beautiful Bill,' threatens to impose a 5% remittance tax on non-US citizens, including H-1B and green card holders, sending money abroad. This could significantly impact the Indian diaspora, who remit approximately $32 billion annually to India. If enacted, Indians in the US could face a $1.

‘The One Big Beautiful Bill’ calls for tax equal to 5% of remittance amount

Its official title is — The One Big Beautiful Bill — but it contains a sting for lakhs of Indians in the US, be they non-immigrant visa holders (like H-1B) or green card holders. Once this bill is enacted, anyone who is not a US citizen and who remits money outside the country will have to pay a remittance tax of 5%.Lately, the US has emerged as the largest source country for remittances into India, attributed to both the size of Indian diaspora and their income levels in America. According to Indian foreign ministry, there are nearly 45 lakh overseas Indians in the US, including nearly 32 lakh PIOs.According to a remittance survey published by RBI in March, of the total remittances of $118.7 billion in 2023-24, nearly 28% or $32 billion were from the US. If this bill is enacted, even if we assume the remittance figure from the US to be constant, the Indian diaspora will end up paying $1.6 billion as remittance tax.The bill is the proposed tax plan released recently by the US House Ways and Means Committee. Tucked away in page 327 of the 389 page document is a section on remittances, which calls for a ‘tax equal to 5% of the amount of such transfer’. As no exemption threshold limit has been set, it would also impact transfers of small denominations. It adds that this shall not apply to any remittance-transfer where the remittance transfer provider is a ‘qualified remittance transfer provider’ and the sender is a ‘verified US sender’. The latter is then defined to mean a citizen or national of the US.In other words, if an H-1B holder or an L-1 (who is in US on an intra company transfer) or even a green card holder remits money to his family (say parents) in India, or remits money for the purpose of investments – say in Indian securities or real estate, the remittance will be subject to a 5% withholding by the transfer provider (say US bank).The House of Representatives aims to pass this bill in May itself and it will then move to the Senate. According to cross-border investment experts, the bill is likely to sail through and may be law by June-July. They are advising the Indian diaspora to try and remit larger funds in the coming weeks to escape the remittance tax.","Us bill threatens to impose a 5% remittance tax on non-us citizens, including h-1b and green card holders, sending money abroad.

US shipments major driver

NEW DELHI: India’s goods exports rose 9.1%, the fastest pace in six months, to $38.5 billion in April, while the trade deficit widened to $26.4 billion, the highest since last Nov. Latest data released by the commerce department pegged imports at $64.9 billion in April, which was 19% higher than the corresponding period last year.“We have opened this year with a bang… I hope India will maintain this export momentum and it should be a good year despite global uncertainties,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal said.A part of the increase in exports may have been driven by front-loading of shipments to the US ahead of the deadline for reciprocal tariffs that kicked in on April 9, only to be paused for 90 days.Shipments to the US went up 27% to $8.4 billion, the latest numbers showed.Overall, electronics exports , a large part of which is through air cargo, shot up nearly 40% to $3.7 billion. Engineering goods, the largest item in India’s export basket, rose over 11% to $9.5 billion, while petroleum products (the second biggest group) were 4.7% higher at $7.4 billion.Some shipments into the country were also advanced, pushing up imports.“The merchandise trade deficit in April 2025 exceeded our expectations despite a healthy growth in exports, partly on account of a front-loading of crude oil imports amid softer prices, as well as a sharp increase in electronics,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA.Petroleum imports soared 25.6% to $20.7 billion, while chemical material more than doubled to $2 billion. Import consignments of metalliferous ores and other minerals zoomed 77% to go past the $1 billion mark in April and non-ferrous metal imports were 30% higher at $2.3 billion. Electronics shipments are estimated to have increased 31% to $9.5 billion.Gold imports were estimated to be 4.9% higher at $3.1 billion.China cemented its position as the top source of imports with a 27% increase to $9.9 billion in April, although Russia just about managed to stay at the second spot with overall shipments valued 18% higher at $6.2 billion. UAE, with an 89% jump, was just $540,000 short of Russia’s level.

US military strategist slams Trump admin for not blocking IMF aid to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-military-strategist-slams-trump-admin-for-not-blocking-imf-aid-to-pak/articleshow/121196427.cms,"Michael Rubin, a US military strategist, criticized the Trump administration for allowing a $1 billion IMF bailout to Pakistan, which he views as a state sponsor of terrorism and a Chinese satellite. Rubin asserted that India won the conflict with Pakistan, dismissing Islamabad's claims and highlighting its defeat. He condemned the IMF's decision, especially after terrorist attacks in India.

NEW DELHI: Michael Rubin, a military strategist with a conservative-leaning US think tank, American Enterprise Institute, has faulted the Trump administration for facilitating a $1 billion IMF bailout package to Pakistan, particularly at a time when the latter is seen as sponsoring terrorists’ as a state policy.“By sending money to Pakistan, the IMF is also effectively bailing out China. Pakistan is today a satrapy of China, its Gwadar port was the original pearl on China’s string, and its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has put Islamabad $40 billion in the red,” said Rubin, who taught at the Naval Postgraduate School till 2021.Rubin joined other international American security experts in asserting that India scored a victory in the four-day limited conflict with Pakistan, calling out the latter’s bluff on inflicting a cost on New Delhi. Instead, he said, it was Islamabad that “went running like a scared dog with its tail between its legs” to achieve a ceasefire.“There is absolutely no spin Pak military can put on what occurred to shield themselves from the full reality of the fact that they not only lost, but they lost very, very badly,” Rubin says in a video comment, dismantling the propaganda peddled by Islamabad, still smarting from a complete defeat under Indian attack on its crucial air bases and critical military installations.In an Op-Ed on Wednesday, Rubin blasted US for not blocking IMF releasing a $1 billion bailout package to Pakistan, one of the “world’s most corrupt countries”. He further says that the IMF move came after Pak-based terrorists infiltrated India and executed non-Muslims in front of their families.The military strategist said that to release $1 billion to a terror-addled, pro-China regime at a time the White House has been seeking to de-escalate tensions between two nuclear states was not just about Pakistan; it was about the IMF thumbing its nose at President Donald Trump.","Michael rubin, a us military strategist, criticized the trump administration for allowing a $1 billion imf bailout to pakistan.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday decided to continue their confidence building measures (CBMs) to gradually reduce the high alertness levels between the rival militaries ranged against each other on the Line of Control as well as the international boundary on the western front.After Indian director-general of military operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai and his Pakistani counterpart Major General Kashif Abdullah reached the understanding on May 10 to cease cross-border hostilities , the CBMs are being strengthened to ensure neither side “fires or initiates any aggressive and inimical action”, an officer said.Follow live updates: Islamabad says Pakistan and India agree ceasefire until Sunday Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Dar told the media that the Pakistan Army had agreed to extend the ceasefire with India till Sunday during a phone call between the two DGMOs on Thursday.

However, Sharif's move was widely mocked and criticised as an unsuccessful attempt to match PM Modi's leadership display.He visited Pasrur and Sialkot airbases (or what’s left of them) to declare an alleged “victory” under the theatrically named “Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos.”But the Pakistani PR attempt backfired. Social media exploded with memes, calling Sharif a “copycat,” mocking the barren backdrop of his speech from atop a tank, and asking whether he was addressing soldiers or scarecrows on a field.“Shehbaz Sharif’s obsession with India is unreal. Modi visits a real airbase, Shehbaz rushes to a random farm like: ‘Look! No damage here!’ From PM to PR clown, Shehbaz is the only leader who treats national security like a TikTok trend,” one user posted.In the viral video of his visit, flanked by Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir and what appeared to be borrowed tanks, Sharif boldly claimed Pakistan had “defeated India,” framing it as revenge for 1971. That’s when the memes really took off.“War khud hi announce karo, khud hi jeet jao, aur khud hi tali bhi baja lo, kya baat hai Pakistan!” a user joked.“PM Shehbaz Sharif: ‘We have won the war.’ Meanwhile, even their GPS can't find the airstrip,” quipped another.While PM Modi walked shoulder-to-shoulder with IAF personnel and was pictured beside S-400 systems and MiG-29 fighters, Sharif’s visuals featured him standing solo atop a tank in what users called a “crop field.” No runway, no radar, no aircraft — just dusty ground and declarations.“Picture of Shehbaz Sharif from Kirana Hills,” mocked one user, referencing unverified reports of a nuclear radiation leak in the region — which India has denied striking.“They will do everything India does, even if they don’t have the resources,” another added.The trolling continued with users dubbing the Pakistani leader as “PR Minister” and drawing parallels with Bollywood and sitcom characters. Clips from Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Gangs of Wasseypur, and Welcome were edited to mock the speech.“Udit Bhai feat,” wrote a user, referencing the viral “Welcome” meme.“Modi to Shehbaz Sharif,” another captioned a Gangs of Wasseypur clip showing a character laughing uncontrollably.The Pakistani PMO posted filtered photos of Sharif with troops but conspicuously avoided any shots of runways or airstrips, a fact not lost on online commentators, many of whom believe this confirms the heavy damage inflicted by India during Operation Sindoor.India has denied Pakistan’s counter-claims of downing jets or damaging airbases. PM Modi’s landing in a Hercules aircraft and speech from a fully operational airstrip was seen as a mic-drop moment.“Shehbaz Sharif trying to copy Modi is like a school kid copying homework but forgetting the main question,” a meme read.Notably, this isn’t Sharif’s first Modi mimicry. After Modi restructured India’s National Security Advisory Board with a former RAW chief, Sharif made headlines for appointing ISI chief Gen Asim Malik as NSA. His speeches post-terror attacks often echo PM Modi’s tone - minus the audience, impact, or airpower.“From Kirana Hills to copycat thrills, Shehbaz Sharif’s only battlefield is Twitter,” one user said.India’s Operation Sindoor, launched after Pakistan’s drone and missile attacks, reportedly damaged multiple airbases across Pakistan. International media like The New York Times and The Washington Post acknowledged India’s upper hand.PM Modi, addressing IAF personnel, declared, “Ghar mein ghus ke maarenge,” while Sharif was left fending off online laughter.","Pakistan's pm shehbaz sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the pasrur cantonment in sialkot.

NEW DELHI: In one of the most daring and technologically advanced operations, the Indian Air Force (IAF) used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on Pakistani airbases in Round 2 of Operation Sindoor on May 10. According to sources quoted by ANI, approximately 15 BrahMos missiles were launched in precision attacks that targeted critical infrastructure across 11 of 12 key Pakistani Air Force bases, effectively paralysing its air defence and strike capabilities.The missile strikes came as part of Round 2 of India's counter-offensive following the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which was carried out by Pakistan-backed groups. On the night of May 9–10, as Pakistan tried to target civilian and military infrastructures in India, New Delhi escalated military response under the broader Operation Sindoor with the BrahMos missiles spearheading the IAF's multi-layered assault strategy.“This was the first time the BrahMos missile system was used in an active conflict,” sources in the defence establishment told ANI. “Its performance exceeded expectations, delivering high-precision strikes that crippled key Pakistani air assets and defence networks,” they said.The IAF’s plan began with the launch of dummy aircraft, designed to simulate an incoming fighter threat. This decoy tactic prompted Pakistan to activate its radar and air defence systems, including the HQ-9 missile batteries. Once these systems were exposed, Indian forces launched loitering munitions, such as the Israeli Harop drones, to neutralise the air defence grid.With the Pakistani radar network compromised, the IAF then followed up with long-range precision strikes. The BrahMos cruise missiles, alongside Scalp, Crystal Maze, and Rampage munitions, were used to devastating effect. These were launched from fighter aircraft operating under the Western and Southwestern Air Commands.“The BrahMos missiles played a central role in disabling runways, hardened shelters, and command centers, significantly degrading the Pakistan Air Force’s ability to launch counter-operations,” ANI reported, citing multiple defence sources.The aftermath of the strike forced the Pakistani military to relocate many of its aircraft to rear bases and reportedly resulted in the loss of several high-value assets, including long-endurance UAVs and an airborne early warning system destroyed in a hangar in Sindh province.According to ANI, the intensity of the BrahMos-led strikes forced Pakistan to abandon its plans for further retaliation. In a telling sign of the damage inflicted, Pakistan urgently sought a Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) level meeting to propose a pause in hostilities and explore an understanding with India.The operational use of BrahMos in this conflict marks a historic milestone for India's missile capabilities. Developed jointly by India and Russia, the BrahMos is known for its Mach 2.8 speed, precision strike capabilities, and versatility across land, sea, and air platforms.“This operation has not only validated the BrahMos missile’s deterrent value but also demonstrated its potency as a first-strike option in modern warfare,” a senior defence official told ANI.",The indian air force (iaf) used brahmos supersonic cruise missiles to devastating effect during retaliatory strikes on pakistani airbases.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo has defended its tie-up with Turkish Airlines amid the anti-Turkiye mood in the country after Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supported Pakistan.Besides, the partnership could face the heat after govt withdrew security clearance to Celebi for offering ground handling services at nine Indian airports.“The India-Turkey air services agreement (ASA or bilaterals) allows carriers of Turkey and India to operate a total of 56 flights per week between India and Turkey. Currently, IndiGo operates direct flights to Istanbul via leased 500 plus seater aircraft and offers codeshare seats to travellers to more than 40 points in Europe and USA supported by its domestic network. This arrangement provides multiple benefits to Indian travellers, and the country’s economy. The additional long-haul capacity has enabled availability of seats for Indian passengers at reasonable airfares, coming at a time when long-haul international airfares have increased substantially owing to the impact of Covid,” IndiGo said.The airline said before it commenced operations, Turkish Airlines was the sole carrier on this route. “The codeshare has enabled IndiGo to build its presence in long haul markets in Europe and USA, putting in place the foundation for self-sufficiency — its long-haul foray with the 40 A321XLR and 30 A350 aircraft ordered by the airline.This arrangement not only enhances the connectivity of Indian hubs like Delhi and Mumbai, but the additional revenue has also led to increased tax contributions to the Indian exchequer, supporting economic growth,” IndiGo said .",Indigo has defended its tie-up with turkish airlines amid the anti-turkiye mood in the country after recep tayyip erdogan openly supported pakistan.

They know what to do. We are prepared to discuss with them what is to be done about terrorism. Those are the talks which are feasible,"" he added.Jaishankar reiterated that the Treaty would remain ""in abeyance"" until the neighbouring nation took actions against ""the cross-border terrorism"".""The Indus Waters Treaty is held in abeyance and will continue to be held in abeyance until the cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped... The only thing which remains to be discussed on Kashmir is the vacating of illegally occupied Indian territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir; we are open to that discussion,"" he said.This came after Pakistan signaled its willingness to discuss the treaty after New Delhi suspended it in retaliation to the Pahalgam attack that killed 25 Indians and one Nepalese citizen on April 22.Jaishankar said that the tariff negotiation and trade talks with the States was ongoing and ""any judgment on it would be premature"".""Between India and the US, trade talks have been going on. These are complicated negotiations. Nothing is decided till everything is. Any trade deal has to be mutually beneficial; it has to work for both countries. That would be our expectation from the trade deal. Until that is done, any judgment on it would be premature,"" he said.This came after US President Donald Trump said that India had agreed to bring down tariffs to nothing. ""They've offered us a deal where basically they're willing to—literally—they charge us no tariff. We go from the highest tariff—you couldn't do business in India, we're not even in the top 30 in India because the tariff is so high—to a point where they have actually told us (I assume you too, Scott, you were working on that also) that there will be no tariff. Would you say that's the difference? They were the highest, and now they're saying no tariff,"" he said.Trump has claimed at several occasions that he mediated the India-Pakistan truce and even stated that he threatened to stop trading with the two if they did not stop the military operations against each other.Incidentally, he was the first one to announce the cessation of military operations before any official confirmation from either nations.“Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan, and I used trade to a large extent to do it,” he said during his first official visit to Saudi Arabia. “I said, fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles. Let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully,” he added.The claims, however, have been repeatedly dismissed by India with the country claiming that no talks regarding trade was held post Operation Sindoor and the truce talks were purely bilateral.","External affairs minister s jaishankar on thursday reiterated india's stance on pakistan. He categorically stated that talks between the two nations could only take place regarding dismantling of terror infrastructure and vacating pok. He further said that the indus waters treaty would ""continue to be held in abeyance until the cross-border terrorism "" issue was resolved.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121187813,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611049,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

LONDON: A high court judge in London on Thursday has refused fugitive Indian businessman Nirav Modi bail for the eighth time.Justice Fordham said: “There are substantial grounds for believing that if released by me on bail that applicant would fail to surrender and interfere with witnesses.”Nirav has been in prison in the UK for over six years since he was arrested on an extradition warrant in March 2019 charged with defrauding Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion.Nirav’s barrister Edward Fitzgerald KC argued that Nirav had been held as an undertrial a disproportionate length of time, that all his co-defendants in India, including one Shetty, who Fitzgerald described as “the main mover” in the scam, had got bail, and that there was no chance of Nirav absconding.“What the Christian Michel and Jagtar Johal and Latifa case, and countless others, show, including the murder and attempted murder in Canada and America, is that the reach of the Indian govt is practically limitless. The idea he could go to Vanuatu and there be safe from the govt of India is utterly ridiculous,” Fitzgerald said. “They will either send a hit squad to get him or kidnap him or lean on govt to deport him to India.”The judge questioned this, saying if the Indian govt’s power were limitless, couldn’t they get him in the UK?“He is safe in the UK as police give Osman warnings,” he said.Fitzgerald claimed Michel was “blindfolded, handcuffed and flown on private jet from the UAE to India”, that Johal was “kidnapped on the street”, and Latifa was “kidnapped” by the Indian authorities “These make the danger of extrajudicial retaliation or reprisals even greater,” he said.He said Nirav did not have the resources to flee as his assets had been depleted through being frozen and confiscated. He also said the alleged interference with witnesses was seven years ago, and since then there had been no further such incident even though he has a phone in prison.“Six years in jail is too long” he said, explaining a “confidential legal matter” that began in April 2018 was holding up his extradition.Nicholas Hearn, representing the Indian govt, said if his fears of state reprisals were genuine, what were the chances of him voluntarily surrendering to go back to India?",Nirav modi has been in prison in the uk for over six years.

He wants its nuclear arsenal under IAEA watch. Singh says Pakistan's nuclear threats failed to deter India's response to terrorism. He calls Operation Sindoor the biggest action against terrorism.

Pak’s been deceiving India for long: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Calling Pakistan a rogue nation with nukes, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Thursday its nuclear arsenal should be placed under the watch of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), and stressed that Islamabad’s nuclear blackmail failed to deter India’s response to terrorism under Operation Sindoor “PM Modi has redefined India’s policy against terrorism which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered as an act of war,” said Singh, addressing troops at Badami Bagh Cantonment in Srinagar on his first visit to J&K since Op Sindoor was launched May 7. Singh’s comments come soon after the PM drew a new red line, stressing that Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail will no longer work and India would continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks.India has a clearly stated ‘no first-use’ nuclear weapons policy but Pakistan has deliberately left it ambiguous and often indulges in nuclear sabre-rattling. It brandishes, for instance, its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to India’s conventional military superiority.Pakistan, of course, has steadily built up its nuclear arsenal due to its well-documented proliferation nexus with China and North Korea. This nuclear option as a leverage against India came to the fore even last week when Islamabad first announced a meeting of its nuclear National Command Authority but then subsequently backed down amid global concern.At Srinagar, noting that the world has witnessed how irresponsibly Islamabad has issued nuclear threats to New Delhi several times, Singh said, “I raise this question before the world: Are nuclear weapons safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation? Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”The defence minister called Operation Sindoor the “biggest action” taken by India against terrorism in history, and a testament to the nation’s commitment to go to any extent to eliminate the menace. “Our forces have shown to the world that their aim is precise and pinpointed, and the task of counting (the body bags) is left to the enemies,” he said.Terrorists targeted tourists in Pahalgam based on their “dharma” (religion), but the Indian forces killed terrorists based on their “karma” (deeds) in the long-range strikes conducted in Pakistan and PoK on May 7, Rajnath said. “It was the dream of every soldier that we will reach terrorist hideouts and destroy them. It was our dharma to eliminate the terrorists.” Addressing the troops, chief minister Omar Abdullah and Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Singh said India has always prioritised peace and never supported war but when its sovereignty is attacked, it is necessary to respond. “If Pakistan continues to support terrorism, it will pay a heavier price,” he said. Recalling Pakistan’s declaration about 21 years ago in front of then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee that terrorism will no longer be exported from its land, Singh said Pakistan has been “deceiving India” for long. Pakistan must stop sheltering anti-India terrorist organisations and not allow its land to be used against India, he said.Pakistan has reached an abysmal state where it seeks loans from the IMF, while India falls in the category of those countries which provide funds to the IMF so that they can help poor countries, he added.","Rajnath singh calls pakistan a rogue nation with nukes.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar reiterated Thursday that the only issue which remains to be discussed on Kashmir is return of part of J&K that is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan (POK), while underlining that Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance till Pakistan stops promoting cross-border terrorism irrevocably.“We are open to discussing that (return of PoK) with Pakistan... So I want you to spell out our positions very clearly... The govt’s position is very, very clear,” he told media at the inauguration of the Honduras embassy.Reiterating India's stand, external affairs minister said Thursday that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will remain strictly bilateral with a focus on cross-border terrorism. He called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists accused of attacking India.US President Donald Trump has offered mediation on the J&K issue, something India has rejected outright.“That (bilateralism) has been a national consensus for years, and there is absolutely no change.

Those are the talks which are feasible,” said Jaishankar.Asked about Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), he said it was was very clear that the treaty is held in abeyance and will continue to be held in abeyance until cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is credibly and irrevocably stopped. The World Bank-brokered IWT allocates the eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi, and Sutlej) to India and the western rivers (Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum) to Pakistan, with some provisions for India to use the western rivers for limited irrigation and non-consumptive uses like power generation.The ministry of external affairs had said earlier this week that IWT was concluded in the spirit of goodwill and friendship as specified in the preamble of the treaty. “However, Pakistan has held these principles in abeyance by its promotion of cross-border terrorism for several decades now,” it had said, adding that climate change, demographic shifts and technological changes have created new realities on the ground as well.","India's relations with pakistan will remain strictly bilateral with a focus on cross-border terrorism.

DOHA: US President Donald Trump on Thursday repeated his claim yet again that he helped ease tensions between India and Pakistan.“…And by the way, I don't want to say I did, but I sure as hell helped settle the problem between Pakistan and India last week, which was getting more and more hostile,” he said while addressing US military personnel at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar. “And all of a sudden, you'll start seeing missiles of a different type.

NEW DELHI: Arbitration is hailed as the best way to settle commercial disputes , and efforts are being made to make India a global hub of arbitration. However, poor drafting of arbitration clauses in India often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself. SC Thursday said those responsible for such poor drafting — including lawyers — should be penalised, and that courts should reject shoddily drafted clauses at the very threshold.Taking note of the fact that a legal dispute between Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and three private contractors went on for a decade on the issue of whether the agreement allowed arbitration proceedings or not, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said the courts must show an unwavering tendency towards rejecting shoddily drafted clauses and must be thrown out of the court.“The drafting of arbitration clauses in commercial agreements in India leaves much to be desired. Despite arbitration being introduced as a means of ensuring speedy and effective dispute resolution, it is evident and ironic that, in certain cases, the process has been misused to further complicate and prolong the resolution of disputes. The manner in which ambiguity is embedded into such agreements raises serious concerns,” SC said.The bench said it is high time arbitration clauses be worded with piercing precision and clarity, and not couched in ambiguous phraseology which is a responsibility of every legal counsel and advisor.In the present case, the court said the willful and wanton wastage of judicial time was highly deplorable.",Poor drafting of arbitration clauses in india often leads to parties litigating for years over the method of dispute resolution itself.

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday asserted that a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial, and he expected that the proposed agreement with the US should help both countries gain from it.“These are very complicated negotiations, they are very intricate, and nothing is decided till everything is,” Jaishankar said. The comments come just ahead of commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal ’s meetings with US trade representative Jamieson Greer and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.But any trade deal has to work for both the countries, and I think that would be our expectation from the trade deal, and until that is done, I think any judgment on it would be premature,” he said on the sidelines of an event.Besides, a team of officials led by India’s chief negotiator Rajesh Agarwal will hold detailed discussions on technical aspects of the proposed bilateral trade agreement , including tariff cuts , removal of non-tariff barriers and rules of origin.“The talks are continuing, they are progressing very well and a team is slated to go to the US to conduct further talks,” commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal told reporters.In the past, too, Trump is seen to have spoken out of turn to claim major gains in negotiations even when officials were still busy finalising the rules of engagement.While India is widely expected to lower tariffs on several products of interest to the US, it also wants duties for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and leather lowered and EAM S Jaishankar’s comments may have been an indication of that.How much of India’s demands are accepted are unclear given that the UK managed to get just around 100 items while the US lowered tariffs in return for levies being slashed for nearly 2,500 American goods. Besides, the UK agreed to buy more planes and other goods from the US to narrow the trade gap.Many trade experts see that as the template for other trade deals as Trump keeps the sword of reciprocal tariffs hanging. Through the discussions, both sides are seeking to take advantage of the 90-day tariff pause that ends on July 9, with an “early deal” also on the horizon to cover a limited set of products.",Foreign minister s jaishankar says a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial.
