Troops now have 365 days to eliminate 'last of the Maoists',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/troops-now-have-365-days-to-eliminate-last-of-the-maoists/articleshow/118654879.cms,"IGP Sundarraj said the door is open for Maoists to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces

RAIPUR: The 365-day countdown for the Centre's deadline for elimination of Maoists has begun.Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI on Saturday that 310 Maoists had been killed since Jan 2024 and that there are barely ""400 regular armed cadres"" left in Bastar division. A total of 385 Maoists have been slain since 2021, which means the bulk of them were killed in the last year.Even the Maoist central committee is greatly weakened and has only 12-14 active commanders left, he added. These numbers give security agencies confidence that they will be able to meet Union home minister Amit Shah's vow to eradicate naxalism by March 2026. Bastar division now has only around 1,200 Maoists left, the IG said, adding, ""The door is open for them to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces.""""With 385 naxalites killed since 2021, Bastar is left with around 400 regular armed cadres. The remaining 700-800 are militia men who serve as a support system, members of the cultural wing, like Chetna Natya Manch and Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangh (DAKMS). The central committee is also shrinking. Our major concern, as well as target, are the uniformed ones, mostly in PLGA formations , and senior-level cadres of Battalion 1,"" P Sundarraj told TOI.Battalion 1 is headed by dreaded Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, whose home turf is now bristling with security forces, and where basic needs, like roads, water and electricity, are pouring in, thanks to the establishment of police camps.Many central committee members have died due to age-related ailments or have been arrested in the past four years, and those left will also be eliminated automatically with the end of naxals, said police. Sundarraj said that militia members often turn out to be just as dangerous as hard-core PLGA cadres, but the focus is to bring them to the mainstream as they understand the phrase ""Jiska Dum Uske Hum (We stand with the powerful)"". ""They realise they are being used as a tool. Once they are on this side of the fence, they only want development and facilities,"" the IG added.Former Maoist Badranna, who now lives in Jagdalpur, said he believes real solution to naxalism is peace talks.Security experts, however, told TOI that these numbers are just a perception and it's not possible to have an exact naxal cadre count. ""For sure, Maoists have suffered massive losses of late and have been pushed to the brink. Their aggression is almost depleted, yet it's a long fight ahead,"" an internal security veteran cautioned.""If naxalism comes to an end next year, no one can guarantee that no violence will happen after March 31, 2026, but the focus is not based on a single-point agenda. The area of their dominance has decreased, their strength is not the same, security camps are bringing about development that people want, so we are hopeful of reaching the desired goal,"" said IG Sundarraj.","Bastar ig p sundarraj told toi that 310 maoists had been killed since jan 2024.

NEW DELHI: India's aim to emerge as a developed country by 2047 is a "" realisable ambition"", said Arvind Panagariya , chairman of the 16th Finance Commission , while also stressing that the country's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.""Certainly if we do the right things in the years to come, our prospects of getting to the Viksit Bharat ambition of the PM is very much realisable dream and realisable ambition,"" he said on Saturday in his address at the 49th Civil Accounts Day.He said the country's per-capita income, in 2023-24 dollar terms, is about $ 2,570, which is very low compared to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, United States and other European nations. ""What that means is that India has the advantage that it is feasible even with existing technology, reasonable capital accumulation and skill acquisition to push the per capita income. India because of its current low per capita income has an enormous room for catch up and that catch up gives it the opportunity to grow significantly faster,"" said Panagariya.The Columbia University professor said India has gone on to gradually improve its governance system and a lot of economic reforms that had to be done have been done. He said more reforms need to be done and those will happen and this will enable India to sustain high growth rates.""Today, our per capita income in dollars is about $ 2,500. To get to $ 14,000 in 24 years or by 2047-48, what growth rate do I need for per capita income?.. my per capita income from 2023-24 onward has to grow annually at 7.3%,"" he said, adding that the $14,000 was the threshold set by the World Bank for defining developed countries.Panagariya, who has served as the first chairman of govt think tank Niti Aayog, cited United Nations data which has estimated that population in the country would grow 0.6% by 2050. He said that this would mean that to achieve a 7.3% growth in per capita income, India's GDP will have to grow at 7.9% during the next 24 years.""Our growth rate (in real dollar terms) for the last 21 years was at 7.8%... To get from 7.8% (GDP growth) to 7.9% is entirely feasible.

India backs EU’s quest for just peace in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-backs-eus-quest-for-just-peace-in-ukraine/articleshow/118637170.cms,"PM Narendra Modi with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen

PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support – in a leaders’ statement after their meeting Friday – for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that’s based on respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.The leaders also reiterated their commitment to the “vision of the two-State solution” with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, consistent with international law. This is the first time India has reiterated its support for the two-state solution at the highest level since President Donald Trump announced his plan to overtake Gaza.The solidarity with the EU on Ukraine is particularly significant in the context of what happened in the UN this week when EU States led by France managed to water down the US “forward looking resolution” on Ukraine in the General Assembly that called for lasting, but not just and comprehensive, peace and a swift end to the conflict. The language used in the India-EU leaders’ statement is similar to one of the 3 amendments that France introduced in that resolution - just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine that respects the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The amendments meant that the US had to abstain from voting on its own resolution in the General Assembly, although it was later adopted in the Security Council in its original form, with 10 votes in favour. The UK, France and the remaining members – Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.Interestingly, neither leader explicitly mentioned the Ukraine issue in their media statements that followed their bilateral meeting. While describing India as a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, von der Leyen only said that authoritarian states are getting bolder, ignoring borders and threatening peace at sea.However, at a public event earlier in the day, she lashed out at Russia for trying to tear Ukraine apart and said what the EU seeks is for any peace talk to lead to “just and lasting” peace. Playing on India’s concerns about China’s expansionism, the EU leader said a failed Ukraine would not just weaken Europe but also ""intensify"" challenges in other parts of the world. “Not least in this region. Other countries around the world are watching very closely whether there is any impunity if you invade a neighbour or violate international borders. Or whether there are real deterrents,’’ said von der Leyen, adding peace, security and prosperity are indivisible in this world.The landmark EU visit, which saw von der Leyen accompanied by the College of Commissioners for the first time, had been in the works for almost 6 months but happened finally at a time its transatlantic alliance is threatening to unravel because of Trump’s policies. The president said wars, conflicts and coups have erupted in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in Africa and across different regions, adding what happens in one part of the world matters to both Europe and India.“With a free and prosperous Ukraine, that can join the European family. And Europe is ready to live up to its responsibility when it comes to security and defence. We will step up our defence spending to ensure that Member States have access to the full spectrum of capabilities that this new reality demands,’’ she added, talking about historic steps to protect Ukraine and its future.",Pm narendra modi joined eu leader ursula von der leyen in expressing support for a just and lasting peace in ukraine.

Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump openly clashed in the White House on Friday at a meeting where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine's mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia . US President gave an ultimatum saying, ""make a deal or we are out.""""Your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out,"" Trump said in the White House in a dramatic verbal clash.""I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out, but you don't have the cards.""""You're not acting at all thankful. It's not a nice thing,"" the US president said. ""It's going to be very hard to do business like this,"" he added.The encounter began when Vice President JD Vance addressed Zelenskyy, stating ""Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""When Zelenskyy attempted to respond, Trump intervened forcefully, declaring ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.""He continued, ""You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.""The Oval Office, traditionally a venue for diplomatic discussions, witnessed an unprecedented display of hostility. Trump openly revealed his intentions to secure American interests in Ukraine's mineral resources and influence the war's resolution according to his preferences.During the earlier portion of the meeting, Trump indicated continued military support for Ukraine whilst expressing a preference for limited arms provision. ""We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms,"" he stated. ""We're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things.""The tension escalated when Vance demanded Zelenskyy to ""just say thank you,"" criticising him for airing disagreements publicly. Trump appeared unbothered by the confrontation, stating ""I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.""He further remarked, ""This is going to be great television.""Soon after the blowup, Zelenskyy was seen leaving the White House without signing the mineral deal.This challenging encounter occurred at a crucial time for Ukraine, as Zelenskyy sought to secure American support against potential future Russian aggression.Despite the confrontation, Zelenskyy is anticipated to finalise a significant economic agreement with the US, focusing on Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, establishing long-term bilateral ties.The agreement, viewed as progress towards ending the three-year conflict, acknowledges Ukraine's security concerns.Before the heated exchange, Trump mentioned the imminent signing ceremony in the White House's East Room, describing it as ""a very fair deal"" and ""a big commitment from the United States.""Trump expressed desire to halt the conflict's casualties, suggesting American funds should be redirected towards reconstruction efforts.Earlier, Zelenskyy had characterised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a terrorist, asserting to Trump that Ukraine and the global community need ""no compromises with a killer.""","Trump shames zelensky as ukraine president rolls his eyes; 'you're not strong but look because...' us president gave an ultimatum saying, ""make a deal or we are out"" trump openly revealed his intentions to secure american interests in ukraine's mineral resources and influence the war's resolution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118635290,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1129497,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

It’s stunning,” Carville said. “There’s an expression here in south Louisiana... ‘that boy ain’t right.’ When you look at Trump, the first thing that comes to your mind, that boy ain’t right.”Carville’s tirade extended beyond the meeting with Zelenskyy, taking aim at Trump’s physical appearance, marriage, and overall health. He called Trump a “fat f***ing slob” with a “beached whale body,” claiming his weight could be contributing to sleep and circulation problems.“I pointed out on this very channel where Trump had red splotches on his hand, which I was told by any number of medical professionals that when you see that condition, the first thing that you suspect is syphilis,” Carville said. “We know from any number of videos that his wife doesn’t want to get in the same zip code as him. If you had a spouse that had syphilis — you know, I’m not saying he does. I want to be clear. I’m just asking questions.”Carville likened Trump’s behavior to that of King George III, who was believed to suffer from mental instability. “What you saw is madness. And I don’t mean madness like I’m mad at you. I’m talking about madness like King George III kind of madness,” he said.While Carville did not provide medical evidence to support his claims, he insisted the idea of a syphilis diagnosis should be “revisited.” The Mayo Clinic describes syphilis as a bacterial infection that can lead to severe complications if untreated, affecting the heart, brain, and other organs.Neither Trump nor his representatives have responded to Carville’s remarks.","Democratic strategist james carville suggested president donald trump should be tested for syphilis.

US Army's lieutenant general Telita Crosland , the head of the military’s health agency, retired on Friday, making her the latest senior officer to leave under President Donald Trump’s administration.The retirement comes a week after Trump dismissed six senior military officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the US Navy’s first female leader.Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, confirmed Crosland’s retirement. ""I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,"" he said in a statement.However, Crosland was told she had to retire. The officials said no reason was given for the decision, two former officials were quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.Crosland, who was the first Black woman to lead the Defense Health Agency (DHA), graduated from West Point and joined the US Army as a Medical Corps officer in 1993. She previously served as the Army’s deputy surgeon general, according to her Defense fepartment biography.The Pentagon, under defense secretary Pete Hegseth, has been moving to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Hegseth has argued that these initiatives harm unit cohesion.""The single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,'"" Hegseth said earlier this month during a Pentagon town hall. ""From our perspective, why do you get rid of something like DEI? Because from our perspective, it’s served a purpose of dividing the force, as opposed to uniting the force.""Trump’s defense officials have also ordered an end to identity month celebrations such as Black History Month and Women’s History Month. They have directed the Pentagon to remove all DEI-related content from its platforms.The administration is also moving forward with a policy to remove all transgender service members from the military.",Us army's lieutenant general telita crosland retired on friday.

Anti-DOGE Protests erupted outside Tesla stores across the United States on Saturday, with demonstrators opposing CEO Elon Musk’s efforts to cut government spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. The protests, part of a broader backlash against Musk’s influence in Washington, also targeted Tesla’s reputation, urging boycotts of the electric vehicle company.According to news reports, more than 50 demonstrations took place across US cities, including Tucson, St. Louis, New York City, Dayton, Charlotte, and Palo Alto, with additional protests planned in England, Spain, and Portugal later in March. A website named 'Tesla Takedown' listed multiple events across North America and Europe.Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist protesting in Boston, said, “We can get back at Elon. We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.”Critics argue that Musk’s moves, including directing government job cuts and shutting down sections of federal agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, overstep Congress’s budgetary authority and could create conflicts of interest due to his business ties. Musk also leads SpaceX, which handles Nasa and intelligence community contracts, as well as the social media platform X.Demonstrations in some locations turned tense. In New York City, around 300 people gathered at a Tesla dealership, with police taking nine individuals into custody. Federal prosecutors also charged a woman with vandalising a Tesla dealership in Colorado, where Molotov cocktails were thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” were spray-painted on the building.Some Tesla owners have reported acts of vandalism against their vehicles, with Jewish groups expressing concern over rising antisemitic incidents. News reports mention spray-painted swastikas on Tesla cars amid the growing controversy.Despite the protests, Musk remains one of the world’s richest individuals, with an estimated net worth of USD 359 billion, according to Forbes. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly a third since Trump took office, though it remains higher than its value a year ago.Carina Campovasso, a retired federal worker, said during the Boston demonstration, “This government led by Trump and Musk, it’s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that. And I hope they listen.”","Anti-doge protests erupted outside tesla stores across the united states on saturday, with demonstrators opposing ceo elon musk’s efforts to cut government spending under president donald trump.

House Republicans mulls removing Washington’s Black Lives Matter Plaza: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/house-republicans-mulls-removing-washingtons-black-lives-matter-plaza-report/articleshow/118657193.cms,"House Republicans seek to remove Washington’s Black Lives Matter Plaza (New York Post image)

House Republicans are working on a plan to eliminate Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, DC, arguing that it represents partisan governance and diverts focus from addressing crime in the city, The New York Post reported.The two-block plaza, located near the White House, was established in June 2020 under Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration and features the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in large yellow block letters across 16th Street NW. An additional “DEFUND THE POLICE” message, added by activists, was later removed during roadwork.House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) confirmed the committee’s intent to address the issue as part of broader efforts to reform governance in the nation’s capital.“The House Oversight Committee and the Trump administration are working on delivering a number of reforms to make our nation’s capital safe and end left-wing pet projects. This includes addressing partisan abuses by the District government such as Black Lives Matter Plaza,” Comer said.The Republican-led initiative aligns with President Donald Trump’s push to eliminate what he calls “woke ideology” from federal governance. The committee did not specify which other projects may be reconsidered.Under the Home Rule Act of 1973, Congress retains the authority to override local decisions in Washington, DC It previously exercised this power in 2023 when it blocked a city law that would have reduced maximum penalties for violent crimes.Republicans, including Trump, have advocated for greater federal control over DC , citing rising crime rates.“Mayor Bowser and Democrat-run Washington, DC are focused on virtue signaling and spending taxpayer money to paint Black Lives Matter instead of the record spike in homicides, carjackings, and other violent crimes,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said.He added: “Washington DC’s failures are a reminder why the city must never become a state.”The debate over Black Lives Matter Plaza remains part of the broader political divide over crime policies and federal oversight in the US capital.","The two-block plaza, located near the white house, was established in june 2020 under mayor muriel bowser’s administration.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above us president donald trump's mar-a-lago resort in florida.

private Moon fleet

WASHINGTON: More than fifty years passed between the last Apollo mission and the United States' return to the lunar surface, when the first-ever private lander touched down last February.Now, starting Sunday, two more missions are set to follow within a single week, marking a bold push by Nasa and its industry partners to make Moon landings a routine part of space exploration.First up is Firefly Aerospace 's Blue Ghost Mission 1 , nicknamed ""Ghost Riders in the Sky.""After launching in January on a 45-day journey, it is targeting touchdown near Mons Latreille, a volcanic feature in Mare Crisium on the Moon's northeastern near side, at 3.34 am US Eastern time (0834 GMT). Along the way, it has captured stunning footage of the Moon, coming as close as 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the surface.The golden lander, about the size of a hippopotamus, carries ten instruments, including one to analyze lunar soil, another to test radiation-tolerant computing, and a GPS-based navigation system.Designed to operate for a full lunar day (14 Earth days), Blue Ghost is expected to capture high-definition imagery of a total eclipse on March 14, when Earth blocks the Sun from the Moon's horizon.On March 16, it will record a lunar sunset, offering insights into how dust levitates above the surface under solar influence -- creating the mysterious lunar horizon glow first documented by Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan.Blue Ghost's arrival will be followed on March 6 by Intuitive Machines ' IM-2 mission, featuring its lander, Athena.Last year, Intuitive Machines made history as the first private company to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, though the moment was tempered by a mishap.Coming down too fast, one of the lander's feet caught on the lunar surface, tipping it over and causing it to rest sideways -- limiting its ability to generate solar power and cutting the mission short.This time, the company says it has made key improvements to the hexagonal-shaped lander, which has a taller, slimmer profile than Blue Ghost, and is around the height of an adult giraffe.Athena launched on Wednesday aboard a SpaceX rocket, taking a more direct route toward Mons Mouton -- the southernmost lunar landing site ever attempted.It carries an ambitious set of payloads, including a unique hopping drone designed to explore the Moon's underground passages carved by ancient lava flows, a drill capable of digging three feet beneath the surface in search of ice, and three rovers.The largest, about the size of a beagle, will connect to the lander and hopper using a Nokia cellular network in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.But ""Grace,"" the hopping drone -- named after computing pioneer Grace Hopper -- could well steal the show if it succeeds in showing it can navigate the Moon's treacherous terrain in ways no rover can.Landing on the Moon presents unique challenges due to the absence of an atmosphere, making parachutes ineffective. Instead, spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burns to slow their descent while navigating hazardous terrain.Until Intuitive Machines' first successful mission, only five national space agencies had accomplished this feat: the Soviet Union, the United States, China, India and Japan, in that order.Now, the United States is working to make private lunar missions routine through NASA's $2.6 billion Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, a public-private initiative designed to deliver hardware to the surface at a fraction of traditional mission costs.These missions come at a pivotal moment for NASA, amid speculation that it may scale back or even cancel its Artemis lunar program in favor of prioritizing Mars exploration -- a key goal of both President Donald Trump and his close advisor, SpaceX founder Elon Musk.","First private lunar lander, blue ghost, is due to touch down on march 6.

Who is Oleksandr Dubinsky?

Ukrainian MP Oleksandr Dubinsky has demanded the impeachment of President Volodymyr Zelensky following what he called a ""diplomatic failure"" during a tense meeting with US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Friday.In a fiery post on X, Dubinsky lashed out at Zelensky, claiming that the encounter marked the downfall of his leadership.""The public humiliation of Zelensky at the White House, Trump’s acknowledgment of his diplomatic failure, and Ukraine’s loss of unconditional US support have marked the final act of the regime's collapse,"" Dubinsky wrote. He accused Zelensky of driving Ukraine into repression, where dissent is silenced.Dubinsky has called for an emergency parliamentary session to begin impeachment proceedings, listing three key reasons:""Zelensky thought he could rule Ukraine through force. Now he has lost,"" Dubinsky declared, urging lawmakers to act immediately.A member of Ukraine’s parliament since 2019, Dubinsky is no stranger to controversy. He was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of state treason and accused of spreading misinformation about Ukraine’s leadership. The US sanctioned him in 2021, alleging ties to a Russian influence network and interference in the 2020 US election.With tensions mounting in Kyiv and Washington’s support wavering, Dubinsky’s call for impeachment could add new political turmoil to Ukraine’s already fragile landscape.Would Ukraine’s parliament dare to challenge Zelensky at this critical moment?","Dubinsky lashed out at zelensky, claiming that the encounter marked the downfall of his leadership.

'Pitbull' or 'next President'?



'JD is different than Elon'



'He's not speaking loudly': How Trump backed JD



US Vice President JD Vance stole the show of the shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday as he triggered the never-seen-before meltdown on television of world leaders when he imparted a lesson of gratitude to Zelenskyy. This is Vance's second major show in international affairs -- as his critics do not call Friday's fallout a win though Zelenskyy softened his stance hours after the ugly spat.A few weeks ago, Vance's unorthodox remarks at the Munich Security Conference signaled a new working style of the US Vice President who did not baulk before accusing European leaders of suppressing free speech and censorship. The White House meeting of Trump, Zelenskyy saw Vance in a new role of a defender of his boss Trump and neither did Trump intervene to diffuse the situation.Accusing Zelenskyy of leading ""propaganda tours"" of the destruction done by Russian invasion, JD Vance said he has been to Ukraine and seen the situation. “I think it’s disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said, his voice rising. “You bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President … Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”“During the war, everyone has problems,” Zelenskyy replied. “But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future.”It was then that the meeting took an ugly turn and Zelenskyy left the White House without signing the minerals deal.JD Vance is the first choice of the Republicans as the next presidential candidate. Even in the recently concluded CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference), Vance won 61 per cent support as the presidential candidate for 2028. Vance's strong stance in the Zelenskyy meeting made the call stronger.In fact, Elon Musk called Vance the next president after Vance's interaction with UK Prime Minister Keir Stamer where Vance spoke about free speech.However, Vance was called Donald Trump's 'attack dog', and 'pitbull' as he triggered the face-off.One US official told Reuters that the face-off was the flexing of JD Vance. ""Vance is different than Elon. For him to sit and take on Zelenskyy in front of Trump was a very big moment. He moved to support the president, and Trump loves it when people step out to do the confrontation that he usually does,"" the official said.During the heated argument, Zelenskyy referred to Vance as JD and asked, ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?"" Vance called Zelenskyy 'Mr President' and said, ""I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.""Zelenskyy noted that Vance was speaking loudly but Trump who was enjoying the confrontation stepped in and said, ""He's not speaking loudly."" ""You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.""Later in the day, JD Vance did not put any statement on social media after the face-off. He only shared President Trump's statement on the confrontation maintaining a low profile on X.",Us vice president jd vance stole the show of the shouting match between president donald trump and ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy.
