What caused the meltdown?



NEW DELHI: IndiGo’s operational crisis entered its fourth straight day on Friday, triggering widespread chaos at airports across the country, leaving thousands of passengers stranded with no food, water, vacant counters and lost luggages as chaotic scenes continued.IndiGo cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights on Thursday, far above its usual 170–200 daily cancellations, causing widespread disruption across major airports. Most affected routes were linked to Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Goa.According to PTI, airport-wise cancellations included 118 in Mumbai, 100 in Bengaluru, 75 in Hyderabad, 35 in Kolkata, 26 in Chennai and 11 in Goa, with several other airports reporting disruptions as well.Across airports, frustrated passengers complained about long queues, no staff support, uncertainty over alternative flights and hours-long waits at baggage belts. Many shared photos on X showing crowds sleeping on luggage, overflowing check-in areas and piles of unattended bags.Sharing a post on X, one user wrote, “Spent the last 4h at Bangalore airport. Some people have been here for more than 13 hours. Every single Indigo flight has been delayed significantly and then cancelled.I still find privilege in having the opportunity to try and get on any flight so I can get to my meetings, yet, no flights available until 24h from now. This is not progress. Thousands stranded.”Another Bengaluru passenger described a staff interaction, “The plane is ready, but we don’t have a pilot to fly it.”Airlines reportedly increased fares amid the crunch. A Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday/Saturday ranged between Rs 11,000 and Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares touched Rs 19,000.The DGCA held multiple emergency meetings and directed IndiGo to stabilise operations immediately and ensure fares do not rise due to reduced capacity.To manage the crisis, IndiGo has requested temporary exemptions from certain FDTL provisions for its A320 fleet until February 10, 2026.IndiGo assured the regulator that “normalized and stable operations will be fully restored by 10 February 2026.” The DGCA has asked IndiGo to submit a detailed roadmap on pilot hiring, training schedules, roster restructuring and safety assessments. A 15-day progress report is now mandatory.A DGCA inspection at Delhi’s Terminal 1 found passenger-handling manpower “inadequate”, and the airline has been told to urgently increase staff across affected terminals.Pilot associations have criticised IndiGo for poor planning. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) alleged that despite a two-year notice period, IndiGo “inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze.”In a statement on X, IndiGo said, “We extend a heartfelt apology to all our customers and industry stakeholders who have been impacted by these events… IndiGo teams are working diligently… to reduce the cascading impact of these delays and restore normalcy.”The airline urged passengers to check flight status before travelling.With IndiGo operating 65% of India’s domestic market, disruptions have hit other carriers too. Aircraft stuck at airports like Pune delayed the movement of other airlines.A Bengaluru-bound passenger told TOI that alternate flights were so expensive that “a ticket to Bengaluru had become pricier than a seat at a Taylor Swift concert.”IndiGo has informed the regulator that more cancellations are likely in the coming days. Flight operations will be trimmed from December 8 to reduce disruptions.IndiGo operates more than 400 aircraft, runs over 2,300 flights daily, connects 90+ domestic and 45+ international destinations, and flew 118 million passengers in FY25. It was recently named “Best Airline in India and South Asia” at the 2025 Skytrax Awards.IndiGo attributed the disruption to “unforeseen operational challenges” including technical issues, weather interruptions and the rollout of revised crew duty rules (FDTL norms).The DGCA, however, said the disruptions stemmed from misjudging manpower needs under the new rules that limit pilot duty hours and night landings. After reviewing data, the regulator said the airline’s crew requirements “exceeded their anticipation”.IndiGo reported that for December, it has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers, insufficient under the new norms. Despite this, the airline increased domestic flights by 6% for the winter schedule—widening the gap between available pilots and scheduled flights.The DGCA said that, “These disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation.”","Indigo cancelled over 550 domestic and international flights on thursday, far above its usual 170–200 daily cancellations.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

Disruptions May Continue For Next Few Days

Will stabilise ops by Feb 10: IndiGo

NEW DELHI: There were unprecedented disruptions at IndiGo and misery at airports across India, with about 300 IndiGo flights cancelled on Thursday. IndiGo’s problems had consequences for passengers of other airlines too at places like Pune. The airline, the DGCA said, admitted grossly under-estimating pilot requirements for its current schedule under new crew duty rules.These “disruptions have arisen primarily from misjudgement and planning gaps in implementing phase 2 of the flight duty time limitation, with the airline accepting the actual crew requirement for new (rules) exceeded their anticipation,” the DGCA said after meeting the airline management.IndiGo has told DGCA flight cancellations will continue for two-three days and, from Monday (Dec 8), it “will reduce flight operations to minimise disruption”. “IndiGo has assured DGCA that corrective actions are under way and that normalised and stable operations will be fully restored by Feb 10, 2026,” DGCA said. For that to happen, the airline has sought “operational variations/exemptions from specific FDTL provisions… for Airbus A320 operations up to Feb 10, 2026”.A call on granting these exemptions could be taken as early as Friday as restoring a semblance of normalcy is crucial before the annual fog season envelops north India around mid-Dec and starts disrupting flights all over again.While IndiGo underestimated crew requirements post-Nov 1, when the second phase of FDTL rules came into effect, it increased domestic flights by 6% from 14,158 this summer to 15,014 in the winter schedule, in force since Oct 26. What is being witnessed now — a yawning gap between flights and crew required — has proven to be a miserable double whammy for flyers.This admission of miscalculation and submission for exemption came on a day when IndiGo’s woes — due to its sheer size — engulfed passengers of other airlines too. For instance, having its aircraft stuck at Pune airport with no pilots to fly them meant other airlines’ flights could not operate there. At some airports, fed up with long waits and unending uncertainty, angry passengers protested at departure gates and other airlines could not board their flyers. On Wednesday, IndiGo’s on-time performance had dropped to 19.7%.“IndiGo has crossed all limits. They show the flight is on time, checks in people and baggage. They show scheduled flight departure times on boards and, when the time comes, that flight number just vanishes. We’re stuck and helpless,” fumed a passenger who was to fly to Bengaluru from Delhi on Tuesday at 8.45pm. “It’s a bad situation but IndiGo is making it worse with its unethical behaviour,” he added.Inspecting Delhi airport’s Terminal 1, “which witnessed the highest passenger imp-act”, DGCA found “IndiGo’s passenger-handling manpower was inadequate to manage disruption-induced crowding”. While instructing the airline to “urgently increase manpower and strengthen passenger support services at all affected terminals”, the regulator has asked its officials to “conduct real-time inspections at major airports to evaluate IndiGo’s management of flight disruptions. ”An official at a small airport said, “Our stalls quickly ran out of all food due to the number of stranded passengers.” The aviation minister has instructed operators to inform all airport directors that they should provide support to stranded passengers. DGCA has been asked to closely monitor airfares.At its meeting with DGCA, “IndiGo presented data on cancellations and provided initial reasons, including transitional challenges in implementing the revised FDTL, crew-planning issues, and winter-season operational constraints”. The revised FDTL norms were implemented in two phases — July 1 and Nov 1 — following court directions to “strengthen fatigue management and ensure enhanced flight safety”.IndiGo informed DGCA it was “facing significant transitional challenges in roster planning and crew availability under Phase-2 FDTL requirements. These issues, combined with winter operational constraints, have contributed to the sharp spike in cancellations and delays.”“Reviewed the operations of IndiGo along with senior aviation ministry and DGCA officials. I have instructed DGCA and officials concerned at the ministry to keep a close watch on the network and directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest. In addition, AAI and other airport operators have also been directed to provide all support to stranded passengers,” civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a post on social media.",Indigo has told dgca flight cancellations will continue for two-three days. The airline admitted grossly under-estimating pilot requirements for its current schedule.

Rupee Slides To Record Low Of 90 Per Dollar As Trade Uncertainty, Dollar Demand And Oil Costs Spike

Why it matters

Your next iPhone, fridge, or car? Costlier.

Zoom in: Why did the rupee drop?

Three main reasons:

Trade tensions with the US:

Investor exodus:

Policy shift at the RBI:

The big picture: What makes this different from earlier rupee crises?

Dollar vs Rupee History

What they’re saying

Between the lines: Life is already getting more expensive

Oil & energy:

Electronics & appliances:

Everyday inflation:

Zoom in: Families, students, and borrowers are hurting

For students abroad:

Education loans hurt more:

Borrowers and consumers:

What's next: The pressure is widespread

Is this good for exporters?

The textbook answer: Yes. The reality: It's complicated.

Winners: IT and business service firms paid in rupees but billing in dollars see better margins-though many hedge currency exposure, which limits gains.

Mixed bag: Pharma exporters benefit from the exchange rate but are squeezed by global price pressures and rising import costs of raw materials.

Losers: Textile and light manufacturing should win-but US tariffs blunt their advantage.

Silver lining: Remittance recipients are smiling

What Indian families should do now

Match currency of income and loans: If you earn in rupees, avoid dollar loans.

Hedge wisely: For tuition and foreign payments, consider forward contracts or staggered payments to limit exchange rate shocks.

Plan with a cushion: Assume the rupee could drop further. Many consultants now suggest budgeting with Rs 93–95/$ in mind for 2026 plans.

Leverage remittances smartly: Fixed deposits and short-term debt funds offer high real returns right now-worth exploring.

Diversify investments: Global mutual funds or India-focused funds heavy in export sectors (like IT or pharma) may offer better protection.

The bottom line:

(With inputs from agencies)

Rupee at record low! On Wednesday, the Indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below Rs 90 to the US dollar for the first time. Though the drop from Tuesday’s 89.94 may seem minor, the implications aren’t.This milestone isn’t just psychological-it signals a shift in how India’s economy is perceived, managed, and felt by its citizens.The ripple effects stretch far beyond Dalal Street or forex traders. The rupee’s weakness is now hitting the average Indian household - from their fuel bills to EMIs, tuition fees, and travel costs.Micro meets macro: Imports = inflation: India imports 90% of its oil, and also depends on overseas suppliers for electronics, fertilizers, and edible oil. A weak rupee inflates these bills.Foreign education: Students studying abroad could be shelling out Rs 5–10 lakh more annually compared to 2023, especially those paying USD tuition and living costs.Recent trade negotiations failed, and US tariffs on Indian exports-some rising by 50%-hit business confidence hard.Despite steady inflation and GDP growth, foreign investors pulled out $17 billion from Indian equities in 2025, adding pressure on the rupee.The International Monetary Fund reclassified India's exchange rate regime from ""stabilized"" to ""crawl-like."" This suggests the RBI is now guiding, not guarding, the rupee.The dollar isn’t the main villain: In 2022, a strong dollar weakened currencies across the globe. This time, the rupee is down even as the dollar remains steady.India’s war chest is full: The RBI has $690 billion in reserves-unlike the 2013 taper tantrum or the 2018 oil price shock. This creates strategic patience.Philosophy shift at RBI: Instead of fire-fighting, the central bank now aims for long-term resilience. Its goal is no longer to defend Rs 90 at all costs, but to allow natural depreciation based on fundamentals-like inflation differentials and trade shifts.“For now, the central bank may be letting the rupee weaken a little more to make exports more competitive in light of US tariffs,” said David Forrester of Crédit Agricole.Bloomberg dubbed the rupee “Asia’s worst-performing currency this year.”“If they allow the rupee to close above 90, we could see further speculative bets and the possibility of the rupee heading to 91,”Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities, told Bloomberg. The recent slide is “hard to justify on a fundamental basis,” he added.""The weak macro picture in India makes weak currency performance inevitable, there has been a slide in so many data points recently – rising trade deficits, weakening nominal GDP growth, weak FDI and foreigner selling down domestic equities, etc,"" Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, told Reuters.The RBI’s stance? Let it float-for now. With over $690 billion in reserves, India can act if needed, but the central bank prefers gradual adjustment to aggressive defense.The depreciation isn't academic-it’s household.India imports 90% of its crude and over 60% of its edible oils. A weaker rupee makes them costlier.Imported items-laptops, fridges, smartphones-will now come with steeper price tags.Cooking oil, LPG, and petrol will squeeze budgets further, especially for lower- and middle-income households.Tuition at $50,000/year was Rs 40 lakh at ₹80/$, but now it’s Rs 45 lakh. That’s a ₹5 lakh hike-several months’ salary for many middle-class families.A student repaying a dollar loan taken at Rs 80 now owes 12–13% more in rupee terms.A family earning Rs1.5 lakh/month may now have to dip into savings or cut essentials to meet new EMI demands of student loans.Vacations abroad? That $2,000 family trip just went from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 1.8 lakh.Small businesses: Those reliant on imported components or foreign travel now face higher costs and tighter margins.“If your goods hit a tariff wall of 25% or 50%, it’s less helpful,” said one trade economist.India received $137–138 billion in remittances in 2024-more than double any other country.A $500 monthly remittance now brings in Rs 45,000 instead of Rs 40,000.For rural and low-income families, this extra Rs 5,000/month is real uplift-sometimes funding education, healthcare, or property investments.The rupee's fall past 90 is more than a number-it’s a marker of a new phase in India’s economic story.In letting the rupee float, policymakers are betting on long-term gains over short-term defense. But for millions of Indian families, that bet is already affecting daily life, monthly budgets, and multi-year plans.","The indian rupee broke a historic barrier, falling below rs 90 to the us dollar for the first time.

IndiGo says more cancellation in next few days

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026. IndiGo said its recovery plan includes accelerated crew recruitment, intensified training cycles and a phased reintroduction of flights once adequate staffing and roster resilience are secured.",The civil aviation ministry and the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise.

With new US sanctions throttling Russia’s oil exports and global isolation deepening, Moscow is turning to India with warm words and strategic asks.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called India a “historic partner” and thanked it for its “friendly stand” on Ukraine - a notable shift in tone as Moscow seeks to protect its last big energy customer outside China.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Why it matters



Putin needs India to remain open to Russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the West or China.

needs India to remain open to Russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the West or China. PM Modi needs assurances on energy stability, defense reliability, and Russia’s geopolitical neutrality - while carefully managing relations with the US.

Between the lines: A fragile oil lifeline



India was buying just 2% of its crude from Russia in early 2022. Now it sources 35–40%, briefly overtaking China as Moscow’s top customer.

But that flow is stalling. New US sanctions on Russian firms like Rosneft and Lukoil are spooking Indian refiners. Imports have dropped and are expected to hit a 3-year low in December.

The big picture: Moscow’s shrinking circle



Zoom in: A trade boom - with problems



Imports from Russia: $63.8bn - mainly crude oil, fertilizers, and coal.

Exports to Russia: < $5bn - a mix of pharma, food, machinery, and electronics.

Sanctioned Russian banks are unable to repatriate dividends from Indian joint ventures like Sakhalin-1 and Vankorneft.

India’s central bank is pushing for rupee–rouble settlements to bypass the dollar-dominated SWIFT system, but progress is slow.

Cheap oil, costly problems



A record trade deficit with Russia ($60bn). Frozen payments due to sanctioned financial channels. Diplomatic backlash from Washington and Brussels.

Defense ties: Still strong, but not what they used to be



From 70% a decade ago, Russia’s share of India’s defense imports is now down to 36% (SIPRI).

India is diversifying: Rafales from France, Apaches and drones from the US, and a push for indigenous platforms under “Make in India.”

Still, Moscow is far from irrelevant:

India signed a $248m deal this year to upgrade its Russian T-72 tank engines.

Talks are on for Su-57 fifth-gen fighters and more S-400 air defense systems.

Joint ventures like BrahMos missiles and AK-203 rifles remain cornerstones of the partnership.

The Trump factor: Tariffs, threats, and trade friction



In August, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods - citing oil imports from Russia as one justification.

The administration has labelled India’s oil strategy “a security problem” and signaled more pressure could follow.

Yet, negotiators are quietly working on a limited trade deal focused on digital taxes, market access, and regulatory clarity.

What Modi wants from Putin



Trade rebalancing: Russia must walk the talk and buy more Indian goods - especially in pharma, food, and light manufacturing.

Secure payment systems: Delhi wants foolproof local-currency arrangements and clarity on remittances blocked by sanctions.

Energy and nuclear cooperation: Commitments on oil volumes and pricing, plus guarantees on Kudankulam reactors and future small modular units.

Geopolitical neutrality:India wants assurance that deepening Russia–China ties won’t be weaponized against Indian interests in Asia.

What’s next

The bottom line



India has always been seen as a purely positive example. It is a non-Western country that is growing rapidly, plays by the rules, and focuses primarily on its own development without having excessive ambitions abroad. An article in Russia Today

Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in New Delhi on Thursday evening for a high-stakes two-day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi - his first state visit to India since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.“We are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with India,” Peskov said, framing the summit as a reflection of “deep trust and mutual respect.”This is no ceremonial visit. It's a transaction wrapped in tradition - a negotiation between a sanctions-hit petro-state desperate to stay relevant and a rising power determined to make every partner earn its place.The backdrop: India is walking a diplomatic tightrope - balancing its Cold War-era friendship with Moscow against growing economic and strategic stakes with Washington.Russia’s war chest still depends on oil - and India has become one of its few dependable buyers.“We see this as a temporary disruption,” Peskov said, pledging “sophisticated” workarounds to maintain energy ties.The pressure: US lawmakers have accused India of being a “laundromat” for Russian crude - refining it and exporting finished products globally. Washington is leaning on India to scale back and buy more American energy.Putin’s visit must be seen through the lens of global isolation and economic squeeze.Europe’s exit: The EU has slashed Russian crude and gas imports. G7 sanctions on tankers, insurers, and pipelines have bitten deep.Tech drought: Russia’s oil and defense sectors are struggling to source critical Western components.Asia pivot: With the West out, Moscow is leaning hard on China and India. China brings scale - but India brings strategic balance and global legitimacy.India–Russia bilateral trade has ballooned to $68.7B in FY 2024–25, up from $13B in 2021. But almost all of it flows one way.This imbalance isn’t just a diplomatic irritant - it’s also a financial headache.“The imbalance is real,” Peskov admitted. “We are looking to buy more from India to fix it.”India has benefited from discounted Russian crude - it helped ease inflation, boosted refining margins, and stabilized the rupee.But it has also brought three major side effects:Still, India is unlikely to cut off Russian oil - it will simply recalibrate.Russia remains India’s biggest arms supplier - but that dominance is eroding.Strategic signal: The new RELOS agreement - a logistics-sharing pact - gives India access to Russian military bases, and vice versa. Delhi already has similar deals with the US, Japan, France, and Australia.President Donald Trump has emerged as a wild card.India’s challenge: Continue talking with Washington without appearing to bow - or ditch Moscow.“This is Modi’s strategic autonomy under stress,” said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi think tank.Putin may be wooing, but Modi isn’t giving anything away for free.India’s demands:“Russia’s relationship with China is not against India,” Peskov said, emphasizing Moscow’s willingness to strengthen ties “as far as India is ready.”The Modi–Putin summit could produce:But every announcement will be weighed in Washington - and possibly followed by more US scrutiny or tariffs.Putin’s Delhi visit isn’t just about oil or arms. It’s about staying visible, keeping options open, and proving Russia is still in the geopolitical game.For India, the summit is a stress test of its global strategy: Can it be everyone’s partner - and no one’s pawn?“You can’t corner India,” said ORF’s Nandan Unnikrishnan. “You have to compete for it.”(With inputs from agencies)","Putin needs india to remain open to russian oil and arms - and not fully pivot to the west or china. Pm modi needs assurances on energy stability, defense reliability, and russia's geopolitical neutrality. India was buying just 2% of its crude from russia in early 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125765029,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-987755,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday personally received Russian President Vladimir Putin at Delhi’s Palam Airport, marking the start of his two-day state visit to India. PMModi greeted Putin with a handshake and warm embrace, before both leaders left the airport together in the same vehicle.Putin’s arrival was met with a security grid comprising the Delhi Police, Special Protection Group (SPG), and Russian security officials. Flex boards and Russian flags lined the airport route, and advanced surveillance systems were activated across key areas of the capital.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also presidented Russian president Vladimir Putin a copy of the Gita in Russian.""The teachings of the Gita give inspiration to millions across the world,"" said PM Modi on X.The two leaders will co-chair the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit, where more than 10 inter-governmental agreements and over 15 commercial MoUs are expected to be signed. Key focus areas discussed by officials include trade expansion, healthcare, fertilisers, shipping, agriculture, connectivity and workforce mobility.Ahead of Putin’s arrival, defence minister Rajnath Singh underlined that despite global instability, India–Russia cooperation “is moving at a healthy pace.”He welcomed progress toward a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union and highlighted consistent military exchanges between the two sides.Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov echoed the sentiment, describing relations with India as a “time-proven friendship” based on mutual respect and cultural affinity.During the visit, Putin will attend a state banquet hosted by President Droupadi Murmu and is also expected to launch the Indian edition of Russian broadcaster RT.Putin’s first engagement in India is a private dinner with PM Modi. The meeting is expected to cover the full spectrum of the “special and privileged strategic partnership,” ranging from defence and energy security to trade and cooperation in emerging sectors. Discussions will also include global geopolitical issues, Eurasian developments and the Indo-Pacific.The dinner sets the stage for Friday’s structured summit talks.Putin begins his Friday schedule with a visit to Rajghat to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi — a tradition for visiting heads of state. He will then receive a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan, followed by formal summit discussions with PM Modi at Hyderabad House.After a working lunch, Putin will address the India–Russia Business Forum aimed at boosting private sector partnerships and investments. The evening will conclude with a state banquet hosted by President Murmu, after which Putin is expected to depart around 9.30 pm.A joint statement is expected, along with agreements across multiple sectors. Among the key outcomes is the Programme for the Development of Strategic Areas of Russian-Indian Economic Cooperation until 2030, seen as a roadmap to enhance long-term industrial and trade cooperation.Putin’s aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed that bilateral trade reached $63.6 billion in 2024, a 12% rise driven by energy, fertilisers and machinery. He also listed priority areas for collaboration: industrial partnerships, innovative technologies, peaceful space exploration, transport, mining, healthcare and labour mobility.Putin will also attend the launch of Russian media channel RT’s India operations — a signal of Moscow’s growing soft power outreach.Modi and Putin have spoken by phone five times in 2024 and last met in person at the SCO Summit in Tianjin. Despite shifting global alignments and the ongoing Russia–Ukraine conflict, the India–Russia partnership continues to diversify, balancing legacy defence ties with new cooperation in technology, energy transition, education and workforce mobility.","Pm modi breaks protocol, receives vladimir putin with a hug, shares car in big india-russia moment.

NEW DELHI: As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit India for a much-anticipated meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, old images of the two leaders have resurfaced online.The photographs, taken in Moscow in 2001, show Modi — then the Chief Minister of Gujarat — accompanying then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee during an official visit. The visuals, captured during a document-signing ceremony, had first gone viral last year when Modi travelled to Russia, and have reappeared on social media ahead of Putin’s India visit.Modi had later recalled how Putin received him warmly despite his state-level position, engaging in candid discussions on states, hobbies, and global affairs. During the 2001 trip, he signed a protocol agreement between Gujarat and Russia’s Astrakhan region to boost cooperation in petrochemicals, hydrocarbons, trade, science and technology, education, tourism, and culture. He also visited Moscow’s ISKCON temple to offer prayers on Vajpayee’s behalf due to the latter’s health condition, spending considerable time with devotees. The visit marked Modi’s first international engagement as chief minister and his early diplomatic interaction with Putin.Modi returned to Astrakhan in 2006 to extend the pact for another five years with Governor Alexander Zhilkin, strengthening Gujarat–Russia ties in energy and trade. These subnational initiatives later fed into wider bilateral cooperation in defence, energy, and commerce during Modi’s tenure as Prime Minister. Modi has often reminisced about the 2001 meeting, including receiving a framed photograph from the ISKCON visit as a surprise gift during his 2024 interaction in Moscow.","Then-gujarat cm modi accompanying then-pm atal bihari vajpayee, in a meeting with putin.

'Modi Ji Doesn't...': Rahul Gandhi Accuses Govt Of Blocking Meet With Putin, Calls It 'Insecurity'

NEW DELHI: Government sources on Thursday refuted Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi 's allegations that Centre does not allow opposition to meet foreign dignitaries.In its response, it said that during any official visit, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) facilitates meetings for the visiting dignitary with Government officials and designated Government bodies. Any engagements outside the Government framework are organised at the discretion of the visiting delegation.The sources also noted that since Rahul Gandhi assumed office as Leader of the Opposition on June 9 2024, several foreign leaders have met him. These include former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 10 2024; Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on August 21 2024; Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam on September 16 2025; and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on March 8 2025.Also read: Rahul Gandhi's big charge amid Putin's India visit; cites Vajpayee–Manmohan era BJP MP Kangana Ranaut, also reacting to Rahul Gandhi’s remarks, accused him of “misleading the public” and said his claim showed a “lack of understanding of diplomatic protocol.” She added that foreign leaders “meet whoever they wish,” and alleged Rahul Gandhi was “playing victim for attention.”BJP's Aparajita Sarangi also called the allegeation ""ridiculous"". ""Nothing can be more ridiculous than this.They should rise above the politics of allegations and counter-allegations and work for the people... The Russian President is coming to India, in such a situation, the Leader of Opposition should welcome him, and should not come before everyone with such negative thinking at this time. In our government, there is a feeling of respect and equality for everyone. .. The Leader of Opposition should behave with dignity,"" she said.This comes ahead of Putin's highly anticipated visit to India, as Rahul alleged that the government tells visiting foreign dignitaries not to meet the Leader of the Opposition due to its ""insecurity"". ""Generally, the tradition has been that whoever visits India, the LoP used to have a meeting. It used to happen in the Vajpayee government, the Manmohan Singh government. But this is not the case now. Whenever I visit abroad, they suggest that those people shouldn't meet the LoP. People told us we have been informed not to meet the LoP. LoP provides a second perspective; we also represent India, but the government doesn't want us to meet foreign dignitaries. PM Modi and the foreign ministry do not follow this now because of insecurity,"" he said.Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor backed Rahul Gandhi's concern that the LoP gets barred from meeting visiting dignitaries in Modi-led Centre, saying the government ""should respond.""","Government sources refuted leader of opposition rahul gandhi's allegations that centre does not allow opposition to meet foreign dignitaries.

Huge backlog: cancellations even in November, before the current crisis

IndiGo, one of the country's leading airlines, is currently grappling with significant operational disruptions, leading to widespread flight cancellations and delays across major cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.The airline has attributed these disruptions to a combination of factors, including technology glitches, schedule changes, and a shortage of crew due to updated regulatory requirements on crew rostering.The situation has resulted in mounting frustration among passengers, many of whom have been left stranded at airports with little prior notice of changes to their travel plans.In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched a probe into the airline's operations, seeking explanations and a concrete mitigation plan to address the ongoing issues.Here are the 10 things to know about the massive flight disruptions at several airports:Multiple major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad, were hit by a fresh wave of IndiGo flight cancellations as disruptions continued.On Wednesday, in Hyderabad alone, more than 40 arrivals and departures were cancelled, while in Kolkata, the airline scrapped both legs of at least 10 flights.Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru also saw over 42 IndiGo arrivals and departures cancelled, leaving several passengers stranded and adding to widespread frustration among flyers.Passengers from major cities hit by the disruption have been venting their anger over a wave of delays and cancellations, with many saying they received little or no prior intimation about changes to their flights.Several flyers have described being stuck at airports for hours with families, missing important meetings and onward connections as departure times were repeatedly pushed back or flights abruptly scrapped.IndiGo spokesperson issued a formal statement acknowledging the severe disruption caused to operations at major airports. The airline said its network had experienced significant operational irregularities over the past two days arising from multiple contributing factors.""We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience caused,"" said the statement released on Wednesday.The airline assured passengers that it has put measures in place to restore normal operations at the earliest. However, it also cautioned that disruptions are likely to persist for up to the next 48 hours.""To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalize our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,"" they said, ""Our teams are working around the clock to ease customer discomfort and ensure operations stabilize as quickly as possible.""Aviation watchdog DGCA has launched a probe into IndiGo’s ongoing flight disruptions and asked the airline to explain the causes of the current chaos as well as detail its plans to curb cancellations and delays. The regulator has also sought a concrete mitigation plan from the airline after days of disorder at multiple airports.""IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays & cancellations,"" it said in a statement.As per the data released by ministry of civil aviation, IndiGo provided the summary of its recent operational performance.Crew shortage was also cited by the airlines as the reason behind their grappling with the disruptions. ""Implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" said IndiGo spokesperson in a statement.The airline also issued an explanation regarding FDTL, which is majorly affecting the crew operations. They pointed out that stricter rest and duty-hour requirements have significantly reduced crew availability at short notice, forcing the airline to cancel or reschedule flights whenever reserve pilots or cabin crew cannot be rostered within the new limits.Along with crew-related challenges, IndiGo also pointed to a range of other operational factors that together snowballed into the current disruption.""Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,"" IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement.IndiGo reported that it cancelled 1,232 flights during the period, attributing a significant portion of these disruptions to crew and Flight Duty Time Limit (FDTL) compliance issues, as well as airport, airspace and air traffic control constraints that are often outside an airline’s direct control.The carrier’s on-time performance also took a hit, slipping to 67.70 per cent in November compared with 84.1 per cent in October.The performance report by the airlines highlights that in November alone, IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights, many due to crew/FDTL constraints. The airline, which operates more than 2,200 flights a day, recorded a punctuality rate of just 35 percent on December 2, according to data from the Ministry of Civil Aviation.DGCA has summoned IndiGo to its headquarters to explain the factors behind the ongoing disruption and to outline concrete measures to address the continuing wave of delays and cancellations.",Over 70 indigo flights cancelled across india as crew shortage triggers massive disruption.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo’s nationwide operational crisis intensified on Thursday, with fresh flight cancellations and long delays reported across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune. This has resulted in leaving lakhs of passengers stranded and triggering widespread anger amongst them.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has summoned the airline’s senior management to its headquarters to explain the “unprecedented disruptions” and submit an urgent plan to stabilise operations during the peak travel season.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the stress being faced by both customers and staff, and assuring teams that steps are being taken to stabilise operations.In the internal communication, Elbers said the airline is working across multiple levels to normalise services and restore punctuality in the coming days, even as disruptions continue to impact passengers nationwide.“We are feeling our customers’ concern and anxieties just as deeply. We are proactively reaching out to affected customers and helping them in every way possible to ease their discomfort… Our immediate goal is to normalize our operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target… Together, as one team, we will overcome this challenge and emerge even stronger,” he wrote.Passenger anger mounted across major airports as flyers reported waiting for hours without clear updates, with some flights delayed by up to 10 hours and others cancelled at short notice.Social media was flooded with complaints from travellers stuck inside aircraft due to missing cabin crew, families missing connecting flights and business travellers forced to postpone crucial travel.A commuter at Pune airport tweeted, “Situation is worst at Pune airport since @IndiGo6E occupied the hanger. @AkasaAir Flight to Delhi is standing at the hanger since last 2 hours.”A Delhi passenger wrote, “Hi team, we are sitting inside 6E6189 at Delhi airport. It’s been an hour inside the plane. Why start boarding when crew isn’t ready?”From Kolkata, another flyer posted, “Very unfortunate that people in this country face hardships from flight companies. We waited long for the Delhi flight.”At Pune airport on Thursday, prolonged bay occupancy by grounded IndiGo aircraft triggered fresh congestion and sequential delays for multiple carriers.In an official statement, Pune Airport said, “The extended ground presence of multiple IndiGo aircraft awaiting availability of operating crew has resulted in the prolonged occupation of parking bays,” adding that this had a cascading impact on all airlines.Alarmed by the scale of the disruption, the aviation regulator on Thursday summoned IndiGo’s top management to explain the factors behind the chaos and outline a concrete mitigation strategy.“IndiGo has been asked to report to DGCA, Headquarters, to present the facts leading to the current situation, along with plans to mitigate the ongoing delays and cancellations,” the regulator said in a statement.“DGCA is investigating the situation and evaluating measures along with the airline to reduce cancellations and delays in order to minimise inconvenience being caused to passengers,” an official added.In an official statement, IndiGo acknowledged that its network had been “significantly disrupted” and apologised to passengers.“We acknowledge that IndiGo’s operations have been significantly disrupted across the network for the past two days, and we sincerely apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused,” the airline said.“To contain the disruption and restore stability, we have initiated calibrated adjustments to our schedules. These measures will remain in place for the next 48 hours and will allow us to normalise our operations and progressively recover our punctuality across the network,” it added.The Federation of Indian Pilots said the crisis reflects deeper planning failures. Its president, Captain CS Randhawa, said, “Most of these flight disruptions, cancellations and delays have been attributable to, firstly, the crew shortage.”He added, “They have been inducting aircraft. It must be appreciated that when you induct an aircraft, you must have an adequate number of crews per aircraft.”On the revised duty norms, Randhawa said, “After the second phase of the FDTL, new CARs came into effect by the order of the Delhi High Court on 1st of November. They immediately approached the DGCA and sought a variation.” He urged authorities “not to grant such dispensations and variations, and to implement the CAR in totality.”The root of the crisis lies in the implementation of the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms from November 1, which tightened rest and night-duty rules for pilots. These changes sharply reduced crew availability at short notice. The airline has also cited multiple compounding factors.“Minor technology glitches, schedule changes linked to the winter season, adverse weather conditions, increased congestion in the aviation system, and the implementation of updated crew rostering rules (Flight Duty Time Limitations) had a negative compounding impact on our operations in a way that was not feasible to be anticipated,” an IndiGo spokesperson said.Since Tuesday, more than 100 flights have been cancelled daily, with over 200 grounded on Wednesday alone. Government data show IndiGo cancelled 1,232 flights in November, nearly 62 per cent due to crew and FDTL constraints. IndiGo’s shares also fell over 3 per cent in late afternoon trade to Rs 5,417.90 on the BSE.The airline’s on-time performance plunged to just 35 per cent on Tuesday, the lowest among all scheduled Indian airlines and stood at 67.7 per cent in November, down sharply from 84.1 per cent in October.With IndiGo accounting for nearly 65 per cent of India’s domestic market, the widespread flight cuts have also sent fares soaring on key routes. An economy class one-way Delhi–Bengaluru ticket for Friday and Saturday was available in the range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 43,145, while Mumbai–Kolkata fares ranged between Rs 8,000 and Rs 19,000.Airport officials said the cascading effect of grounded aircraft and delayed crew rotation continues to strain terminal operations across major hubs, intensifying passenger hardship during the busy travel period.","Passenger anger mounted across major airports as flyers reported waiting for hours without clear updates. The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has summoned the airline’s senior management to its headquarters to explain the ‘unprecedented disruptions’ since tuesday, more than 100 flights have been cancelled daily, with over 200 grounded on wednesday alone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125764144,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1081937,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Modi Ji Doesn't...': Rahul Gandhi Accuses Govt Of Blocking Meet With Putin, Calls It 'Insecurity'

NEW DELHI: Hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s arrival in New Delhi, Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the Modi-led Centre of not following the ""tradition"" of allowing foreign dignitaries to meet the leader of opposition.Speaking to reporters in the Parliament complex, Rahul expressed displeasure and alleged that the government tells visiting foreign dignitaries not to meet the Leader of the Opposition due to its ""insecurity"".Rahul said, ""Generally, the tradition has been that whoever visits India, the LoP used to have a meeting.

""Defence cooperation has been vital—we saw the value of the S-400 during Operation Sindoor. Discussions are on for more S-400s, or even S-500,"" he said.He added that any labour mobility pact must ensure Indians going abroad for work are not pushed into military roles. “There is much to discuss, and I’m sure the PM and President Putin will have a productive meeting,” Tharoor said.Congress MP from Wayanad Priyanka Gandhi also reacted on Rahul's concern of government not letting LoP meet visiting dignitaries, she said, ""It is very weird. There is a protocol, and all visiting dignitaries meet the LoP. The protocol is being reversed by the government and all their policies are based on this. They don't want anyone to raise their voice. They don't want to listen to any other opinion. They should abide by the protocols of a democracy. God knows what they are scared of. .. In a democracy, everyone should be able to put forward their opinions, discussions must be held, and appropriate action must be taken... The government is insecure, and this decision is a reflection of that... What will they get by breaking and reversing this protocol? This is their insecurity... The image of democracy is tarnished in the world.""Meanwhile, Russian media agency TASS reported that President Putin has departed for his two-day state visit to India.According to the outlet, the Russian delegation will hold wide-ranging discussions on cooperation in trade and economic areas, scientific and technological fields, and cultural and humanitarian sectors. Current international and regional issues will also be part of the agenda.TASS also reported that ten intergovernmental documents and more than fifteen agreements and memorandums between commercial and non-commercial entities of both countries are expected to be signed during the visit.Putin is scheduled to arrive in New Delhi this evening for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit. This is his first visit to India since the Ukraine conflict began in 2022; his last visit was in December 2021. The two-day trip is taking place at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi .The Prime Minister is also set to host a private dinner for the Russian President upon his arrival in the capital.","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi accused the modi-led centre of not following the ""tradition"" of allowing foreign dignitaries to meet the opposition leader.

'Israel-India Defense Ties Are Long-Standing And Strategic': Expert Danny Citrinowicz

NEW DELHI: Israel has urged India to formally designate Hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations, saying that New Delhi’s position carries significant weight across South Asia.Senior officials from Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, speaking in Jerusalem, said they believe India understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. They stressed that Israel had already proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and now expects “reciprocation” from India.“Our request from India is to work hard to sanction and designate these organisations as terrorist groups. Israel designated Lashkar-e-Taiba a couple of years ago, and we would like to see this reciprocated,” one official said, as quoted by ANI.Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between Hamas and LeT, and warned that Iran’s IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah have increasingly been relying on transnational criminal groups to conduct attacks.“You're not going to see an Iranian operative act directly in Europe. What you will see is a criminal group -- a drug lord, a human trafficker or another network -- connected to an Iranian handler who then carries out an attack, as we've seen in Scandinavia or in London,” the official said.The remarks came just days after a similar appeal from the Israeli Defence Forces. “It will be a good thing if India did. India and Israel have a common enemy. It will be good to have a clear statement on who we face,” Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, International Spokesperson for the IDF, said in Tel Aviv on December 1.Another official emphasised that even a declaratory move from India would have a “strong global impact”, given the influence India holds in the region. “Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives ‘look up to India’, and New Delhi’s stance shapes regional responses,” the official said.“It's not only about freezing assets or banning operatives from entering India. It signals that India has clearly seen what Hamas is doing, and no operative should step on Indian soil,” he added.“We are putting pressure on India to designate Hamas... After having designated Lashkar-e-Taiba, we would like to see the same,” the official said, noting “clear attempts” by Hamas to rebuild its structures and stressing that dismantling them remains central to the next phase of the US-proposed ceasefire.Hamas, founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, is designated a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Canada and several other countries. India condemned the October 7, 2023, attacks but has not yet listed Hamas under its domestic terrorism laws.",Israel has urged india to formally designate hamas and other groups acting against it as terrorist organisations. Senior officials from israel’s ministry of foreign affairs said they believe india understands the “networks and linkages” behind these organisations. Israel also underlined what it described as strong ties between hamas and let.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125764691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-829933,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

India And Russia Boost Military Ties As Rajnath Singh Highlights Strategic Tech Partnership

Russia’s message at the defence commission meeting





Setting the stage for PM Modi–Putin summit

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday sent out a strong signal about the continuity of its partnership with Russia, with defence minister Rajnath Singh emphasising that bilateral defence cooperation remains steady “despite the geopolitical uncertainty.”His remarks came at the 22nd India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military & Military Technical Cooperation (IRIGC-M&MTC) meeting in New Delhi, held just hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives for the 23rd Annual Summit.Singh described Russia as a “time-tested, special privileged, and strategic partner” and noted that defence ties have grown consistently since the signing of the 2000 Declaration of the India-Russia Strategic Partnership. “I thank you very much for coming all the way to India to discuss and promote bilateral defence cooperation between our countries… It is good that despite the geopolitical uncertainty, our India-Russia defence cooperation is moving at a healthy pace,” he said, as quoted by ANI.He highlighted “outcome-oriented exchanges” between military personnel and experts and also pointed to wider economic engagement.“We welcome the successful holding of the 26th meeting of the India-Russia Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation in Moscow last month, and the commencement of negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union,” Singh said.He added, “We were also eagerly awaiting the visit of His Excellency, Vladimir Putin… which has been fulfilled today.”Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov, co-chairing the meeting with Singh, echoed the sentiment of long-standing partnership.Belousov also noted the extent of military cooperation. “Russia actively cooperates in full scale with India in formation of the new outlook of the Army, Air Force, and the Navy. And using this opportunity, let me congratulate you, the command, and all Indian sailors with the National Navy Day,” he said.On the work of the joint commission, he added, “Distinguished Minister, the intergovernmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation brings the huge dedication in taking part in taking effective and mutually beneficial decisions in the military domain.”Earlier in the day, Singh and Belousov laid a wreath at the National War Memorial, and the Russian minister inspected the Tri-Service Guard of Honour. Belousov was received at Air Force Station Palam by Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth, with Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan also present.Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to arrive in India on Thursday evening for his first visit in four years, beginning the trip with a private dinner hosted by PM Modi. The two leaders have spoken by phone five times in 2024 and last met in person on the sidelines of the SCO Summit in Tianjin.Putin’s arrival marks his first trip to India since 2021 and his first since the Ukraine conflict began in 2022.His return to New Delhi comes as the India–Russia partnership continues to adjust to shifting global dynamics, balancing long-standing defence ties with cooperation in technology, energy transition, education, and workforce mobility.","Defence minister rajnath singh says russia is a “time-tested, special privileged, and strategic partner’ russian defence minister andrei belousov echoed the sentiment of long-standing partnership.

Pakistan Sparks Controversy With Expired Relief Claims As India Rejects Airspace Allegation Strongly

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Tuesday renewed its allegations that its relief operations for cyclone-hit Sri Lanka were being “hampered by lack of cooperation” from India, claiming that permission to use Indian airspace was being delayed.“India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face delays for over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India,” the Pakistan Foreign Office said in a post on X.It added that the “partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief Mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”Shortly after, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them “ridiculous” and “yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.”He clarified that the request for overflight clearance for the Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian aid was received by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad around 1:00 PM on December 1, 2025. “Given the urgency of the humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted overflight permission as per the proposed itinerary at 5:30 PM on December 1, 2025,” he said, in an official statement.Officials also dismissed reports in the Pakistani media claiming India had not granted overflight permission as “fake”. “Pakistani media, as usual, is indulging in propaganda and peddling fake news. These allegations are baseless and misleading. All requests for overflight or transit are processed strictly in accordance with established procedures and international norms,” one of the people said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka faced criticism online after sharing images of the relief materials sent to the flood-hit country.In a post on X Tuesday, the High Commission uploaded photos showing stacks of packaged supplies, stating: “Relief packages from Pakistan have been successfully delivered to assist our brothers and sisters affected by the recent floods in Sri Lanka, which signifies our unwavering solidarity.” However, netizens quickly noticed what appeared to be expiry dates of October 2024 printed on some of the packages.Sri Lanka has been grappling with widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, leaving several districts isolated and severely straining the country’s disaster-response capacity. India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu to assist Sri Lanka in its recovery efforts.The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) confirmed at least 410 deaths and 336 missing as of Tuesday morning due to the catastrophic floods and landslides caused by extreme weather conditions since November 16.","Pakistan claims permission to use indian airspace was being delayed.

NEW DELHI: A day before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in India, India abstained from voting on a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution demanding an end to Russia’s forced relocation of Ukrainian children.The 193-member Assembly adopted the draft resolution ‘Return of Ukrainian children’ on Wednesday, with 91 votes in favour, 12 against, and 57 — including India, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka’s — abstentions.The resolution demanded that Russia “ensure the immediate, safe and unconditional return of all Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred or deported” and urged Moscow to cease, without delay, any further practice of forcible transfer, deportation, separation from families and legal guardians, change of personal status, including through citizenship, adoption or placement in foster families, and indoctrination of Ukrainian children.It stressed the need to investigate and ensure accountability for those responsible for forcible transfers and deportations of children, in accordance with international law. The resolution deplored the legislative and administrative measures taken by Russia since 2022 that “simplify” the procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship for Ukrainian children, particularly orphans, children deprived of parental care and unaccompanied children.Ukraine’s deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa, presenting the draft resolution at the 11th emergency special session of UNGA, said as of Oct 2025, there are 6,395 deported and forcibly transferred children. In total, over 20,000 cases of deportation and forcible transfer are being investigated.Russia’s deputy Permanent Representative Maria Zabolotskaya, in her remarks in UNGA, said the draft resolution is stuffed with “mendacious accusations”, adding it contains baseless allegations of Russia’s violations of international humanitarian law and does not mention that there may be children evacuated from combat zone or those who lost ties with their relatives, which in no way can be regarded as violations.UNGA President Annalena Baerbock said since Feb 2022, when Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Assembly has reiterated its calls, across eight resolutions adopted during its 11th Emergency Special Session, for immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognised territory.","India abstained from voting on a un general assembly (unga) resolution demanding an end to russia’s forced relocation of ukrainian children.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.

Putin’s Grand India Welcome, Modi Rolls Out Red Carpet | Watch Handshake, Hug & Rare Protocol Break

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s arrival in New Delhi for the bilateral summit triggered a massive security build-up on Thursday, turning critical zones of the capital into a multilayered defensive perimeter. Sources said the protocols in place during G20 summit-2023 have been replicated to ensure safety of the dignitaries.Central to the security logistics for Putin is his custom-made Aurus Senat limousine. This vehicle, commonly dubbed a “rolling bunker”, which was flown in from Moscow for the visit, will be used for exigency, sources said. On Thursday, the car was spotted trailing the armoured Toyota Fortuner in which PM Narendra Modi and Putin traveled together.The Senat resulted from Russia’s Kortezh project, an initiative to develop indigenous vehicles for top state officials. This car is designed to withstand sniper fire, IED blasts and chemical attacks, featuring run-flat tyres and emergency oxygen supply.A concentric five-layer security grid has been set up, blending the advanced protective protocols of Russia’s internal agencies with those of India’s elite counter-terrorism forces to ensure foolproof protection from the moment the presidential aircraft landed to the time of its departure.A special control room has been set up in each hotel with rooftops being occupied by snipers who have guns equipped with AI-aided technology for calculation and aiming. Anti-drone systems have been installed around the venues as well. For air travel, Putin uses a specially modified Ilyushin IL-96-300PU, sometimes called the “Flying Kremlin,” equipped with four engines, advanced command systems and missile-defence countermeasures, which is accompanied by backup jets flying similar routes to mask the presidential aircraft.The innermost circle of protection is staffed by personnel from Russian Presidential Security Service (SBP), an elite unit operating under Federal Protective Service (FSO). These highly trained officers, selected for their physical and psychological resilience, will be positioned closest to the President, tasked with shielding him, especially during critical moments of his movement to and from his vehicle.Complementing this core team, India’s NSG commandos and Special Protection Group (SPG) units, alongside SWAT teams and Quick Response Teams (QRTs), will form the subsequent layers. All hotels are under the command of a DCP-level officer.Dummy dignitaries have also been placed in some hotels to boost security, and staff of the hotels have been vetted twice by different agencies, sources said.",Russian president vladimir putin’s arrival in new delhi triggered a massive security build-up on thursday.
