Independence Day: PM Modi warns ‘India will not tolerate nuclear threats’; strong message to Pakistan from Red Fort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/independence-day-pm-modi-warns-india-will-not-tolerate-nuclear-threats-strong-message-to-pakistan-from-red-fort/articleshow/123315637.cms,"PM Modi addresses nation during 79th Independence Day.

NEW DELHI: On India's 79th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi , addressing the nation from the Red Fort, had a message for Pakistan - India will treat terrorists and those who aid them as one, and any future misadventure will meet decisive retribution at the hands of its armed forces.Praising the military, PM Modi said the operation had inflicted heavy losses on Pakistan, with new evidence of the damage surfacing daily. He reaffirmed that India would not bow to Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail.”“What our forces achieved in Operation Sindoor has not been witnessed in decades,” PM Modi said. “We have set a new normal in tackling cross-border terrorism. I salute our brave soldiers who delivered a punishment for the Pahalgam attack far beyond the enemy’s imagination.”PM Modi said that India and its farmers have sole rights over the country’s share of the Indus river waters, branding the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan as “unjust and one-sided.” PM Modi said the decades-old agreement had caused “enormous harm” to Indian agriculture, allowing rivers originating in India to irrigate “the fields of our enemies” while leaving Indian soil and farmers parched.“Blood and water cannot flow together,” he said, adding that the recent terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people.“The waters that belong to India will be used by India, for India’s farmers alone. We will not tolerate any arrangement that deprives them. This agreement is unacceptable to us,” PM Modi said.Signed in 1960 under World Bank mediation, the treaty has governed the sharing of the Indus and its tributaries between India and Pakistan. Modi said India’s farmers had endured “unimaginable losses” for decades under it — a situation his government would no longer accept.","India will treat terrorists and those who aid them as one, prime minister narendra modi said.

"79th Independence Day: 'India has now decided, blood and water will not flow together' - Top quotes from PM Modi's speech",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/79th-independence-day-2025-speech-flag-hoisting-top-quotes-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/123315226.cms,"PM Modi addresses nation on the occasion of 79th Independence Day.

Here are key quotes from his speech:



""Whether it's the deserts or the peaks of the Himalayas, the shores of the ocean or the bustling cities, there is one voice across the nation: we all love India more than our lives,"" says PM Modi from the ramparts of Red Fort.

""For 75 years, the Constitution of India has been showing us the path like a lighthouse.""

""I salute our brave soldiers who punished masters of terror beyond their imagination.""

""India has decided that it will not tolerate nuclear threats anymore, we won't fall for any blackmail. Destruction inflicted by our armed forces in Pakistan was so widespread, new revelations are being made every day. After April 22 (Pahalgam attack), we gave armed forces a free hand to respond to terrorists.""

""India has now decided, blood and water will not flow together. The people have come to realize that the Indus Waters Treaty is unjust. Water from the Indus River system has been irrigating the lands of the enemy, while our own farmers have suffered. What kind of agreement is this that has caused such immense loss to our farmers for the past seven decades?""

""Slavery made us poor. It made us dependent, and over time, our dependence on others only grew. But our farmers led us toward self-reliance and ensured our food security. Even today, a nation's true pride lies in self-reliance, and that is the foundation of Viksit Bharat.

""Dependence on others raises questions about a nation’s independence. It is unfortunate when dependence becomes a habit, a dangerous one. That’s why we must remain aware and committed to becoming self-reliant. Self-reliance is not just about exports, imports, the rupee, or the dollar. It is about our capabilities, our strength to stand on our own.""

""Our enemies had no idea about the capability of 'Made in India', which weapons are simple and which are powerful enough to destroy them in a moment. Just think, if we were not self-reliant, would we have been able to carry out Operation Sindoor with such speed?""

""We are working in mission mode in the semiconductor sector, made-in-India chips will hit markets by end of this year. We have decided to make India self-reliant in energy; taking several initiatives in solar, hydrogen, nuclear sectors.""

""India is now focusing actively on nuclear energy. We have taken significant steps in this direction, with 10 new nuclear reactors currently operational. By the time India celebrates 100 years of independence, we aim to increase our nuclear energy capacity tenfold.""

""Today, India is building a modern ecosystem across every sector. I appeal to the youth and to every department of the government: we must strive to produce Made-in-India jet engines for our fighter aircraft. We are known as the pharmacy of the world, but isn't it the need of the hour to invest more in research and development? Shouldn’t we be the ones providing the best and most affordable medicines for the welfare of humanity?""

""Our military will decide the time and give a fitting response to all acts of terror. Pakistan has lost its sleep after Operation Sindoor. India and its farmers have sole right over its share of waters.""

""Our Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla has returned from the Space Station, a moment of great pride for the nation. India is actively working on the Gaganyaan mission and is also planning its own space station. We must come together to change the destiny of our country. I appeal to the youth: step forward and contribute to this mission of national transformation.""

""The world values quality, and if we want to strengthen India's image in the global market, we must focus on producing high-quality products. We should work with the mantra: ‘Daam kam, dum zyada’, lower cost, higher value. Our independence came through immense sacrifice. Remember those years, when an entire nation lived and struggled for freedom. Their dedication gave us independence. Today, our mantra should be ‘Samriddh Bharat’, a prosperous India. If we continue to be vocal for local, we will achieve prosperity. The previous generation gave us freedom; this generation must commit to making India truly prosperous.""

""Need of hour to take a resolve for building a 'samarth' (strong) Bharat, just like our freedom fighters had envisioned 'free India'.""

""I am going to give a great gift on Diwali. In last 8 years, we did a big reform in GST, tax was simplified, now it is the demand of the time to make a review, we did, also talked to states, we are bringing 'next generation GST reform', it will be a gift on Diwali, tax on common, individual requirement services would be reduced significantly... MSMEs would benefit, it will also help the economy.""

""I have good news for the youth of our country. Today, on the 15th of August, we are launching a landmark scheme worth Rs 1 lakh crore, the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rojgar Yojana. Under this scheme, the government will provide Rs 15,000 as support to individuals who secure their first job in the private sector. This initiative is expected to generate 3.5 crore job opportunities across the nation.""

""The world is confident about India's economy. We are a ray of hope amidst the global instability. Inflation is under control.""

Key points:

PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.

Ahead of the address, the Prime Minister visited Rajghat and paid his tribute.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the nation on its 79th Independence Day and urged everyone to work even harder to build a developed Bharat.""Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind,"" Modi said in a post on X.In his 98-minute address on August 15 in 2024, he had made an unequivocal pitch for a ""secular"" civil code instead of the current framework which is ""communal"" and promoted ""discrimination"", and also for simultaneous polls.He had announced that 75,000 more medical seats will be created in the country in the next five years.Social ills like crimes against women have also figured prominently in some of his speeches, and so are his push for cleanliness and empowerment of women and traditionally disadvantaged communities.Political watchers will eagerly look out for any signalling from him on the foreign policy front at a time when India's generally solid ties with the US are under strain amid Trump's repeated claims of mediating cease fire between India and Pakistan and use of tariff to pressure India on trade.Trump's decision to single out India for high tariff of 50 per cent, his occasional praise of Pakistan and ceasefire claims have given the opposition fodder to attack the Modi government.With Parliament's Monsoon session continuing and marred by disruption from the Opposition, which has alleged poll irregularities and demanded a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, it will be seen with interest whether the prime minister responds to the allegations.His government's muscular stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and naxalism has been a regular highlight in Modi's annual speeches, and this year is unlikely to be any different.The prime minister had sought suggestions from citizens for his address, and it will be keenly watched if some of these ideas make it to his speech.",Pm modi pays tribute to rajghat and urges everyone to work even harder to build a developed bharat.

Trump Thinks 50% Tariff on India Has Put Pressure on Russia, Ex-US Official Calls His Strategy Wrong

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade?

All banks with international branches and operations have to adhere to the government laws to ensure that they do not attract regulatory scrutiny,"" said the person cited above. ""The last European sanctions along with the US tariffs imposed after that have made the processing of transactions for Nayara difficult.""""This call has been taken by the bank very recently after the US sanctions to ensure compliance with international rules,"" the source told ET.

'India on its way to become self-reliant nation': President Murmu addresses the nation on the eve of 79th Independence Day - Top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-on-its-way-to-become-self-reliant-nation-president-murmu-addresses-the-nation-on-the-eve-of-79th-independence-day-top-quotes/articleshow/123306723.cms,"""I extend my heartiest greetings to all of you on the eve of Independence Day. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Independence Day and Republic Day are celebrated by every Indian with great enthusiasm. These are days that especially remind us of our being proud Indians.""

""After regaining our freedom, we marched on the path of such democracy where every adult received the right to exercise franchise. In other words, we, the people of India, gave ourselves the right to shape our own destiny...Despite the challenges, the people of India successfully adopted democracy...For us, our Constitution and our democracy is above everything else.""

""As we look back on the past, we must never forget the pain inflicted by the partition of the country. Today, we observed Partition Horrors Remembrance Day. Terrible violence was witnessed due to partition, and lakhs of people were forced to relocate. Today, we pay tributes to those who were victims of the mistakes of history.""

""Our Constitution contains four values as the four pillars upholding our democracy. They are - justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. These are our civilisational principles that we re-discovered during the Freedom Struggle. At the heart of them all, I believe, is the notion of human dignity. Every human being is equal, and everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. Everyone should have equal access to healthcare and education. Everyone should have equal opportunity. Those who had been traditionally at a disadvantage needed to be given a helping hand. Keeping these principles foremost in mind, we started a new journey in 1947.”

""The country is rapidly urbanising. Hence, the Government has been paying special attention to improve the conditions of the cities. Addressing the key area of urban transport, the Government has expanded metro rail facilities. The number of cities with a metro rail service has gone up multifold in a decade. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, or AMRUT, has ensured more and more households have access to a tap with the assured supply of water and a sewerage connection.

“Last week, on August 7, the country celebrated ‘National Handloom Day’ which honours our weavers and their products. Since the year 2015, we have been celebrating this day to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement launched during our freedom struggle in the year 1905. The spirit of Swadeshi was strengthened by Mahatma Gandhi to promote the products made by the sweat and toil of Indian artisans and crafts-persons, and by their incomparable skills. The idea of ‘Swadeshi’ has been inspiring our national endeavours like Make-in-India initiative and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’. Let us resolve to buy and use Indian products.”

“ In this Digital Age, it is apt that one sector in India that has seen the most dramatic advances is information technology. Nearly all villages have 4G mobile connectivity, and the remaining few thousands will be covered soon. This has made possible large-scale adoption of digital payment technologies, in which India has become a world leader in a short span.

“Artificial intelligence is the next stage of technological advancement and has already entered our lives. The government has launched the India-AI mission to strengthen the country’s AI capabilities.”

""The idea of Swadeshi has been inspiring our national endeavours like Make-in-India initiative and Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. Let us resolve to buy and use Indian products.""

""Fueled by young minds, our space program has witnessed unprecedented expansion. I am sure that Shubhanshu Shukla’s space journey to the International Space Station has fired a whole generation to dream bigger. It will prove extremely helpful for India’s upcoming human space flight program, ‘Gaganyaan’. Brimming with new confidence, our youth are making a mark in sports and games. Chess, for example, is now dominated by India’s youngsters like never before. We foresee transformative changes which will establish India as a global sporting power-house under the vision contained in the National Sports Policy 2025.""

""This year we had to face the scourge of terrorism. Killing innocent citizens on holiday in Kashmir was cowardly and utterly inhuman. India responded in a decisive manner and with steely resolve. Operation Sindoor showed that our armed forces are prepared to meet any eventuality when it comes to safeguarding the nation. With strategic clarity and technical capability, they destroyed terrorist centres across the border. I believe Operation Sindoor will go down in history as an example in humanity’s fight against terrorism. In our response, what was most noticeable was our unity, which is also the most befitting response to those who wanted to divide us. Our unity was also on display in the multi-party delegations of the MPs that reached out to various nations to explain India’s position. The world has taken note of India’s stance that we will not be the aggressor, but we will not hesitate to retaliate in defence of our citizens. Operation Sindoor was also a test case of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission in the defence sector. The outcome has proved that we are on the right path. Our indigenous manufacturing has achieved a critical level that makes us self-sufficient in meeting many of our security requirements. These are landmark achievements in India’s defence history since Independence.""

NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Thursday addressed the nation and extended her greetings ahead of the 79th Independence day.On the eve of Independence Day, Murmu praised India's growth and said that the country is ""well on way to becoming self-reliant nation and is moving ahead with great confidence.""Here's are some of the key quotes from President Murmu's national address:","""i extend my heartiest greetings to all of you on the eve of independence day.

We have also seen evidence for even more Pakistani aircraft being destroyed on the ground. But there was no official confirmation from the IAF, not even from the govt of India. Therefore, this is a nice confirmation for something that was assessed already back in May,"" Cooper said in his interview to ANI on the Indian firepower that dominated the 72-hour limited war between India and Pakistan between May 7 night and May 10.Identifying the Pakistan early warning and control aircraft, which was brought down by the S-400 system, as a Saab 2000, the Austrian endorsed Singh's claim about the successful strike from a range of 300 km was a world record.Also Read: IAF Rattled Pak This Time, But It Needs A Leg-up ""It is the longest range confirmed shoot-down by a surface-to-air missile. This is a historic achievement,"" he said, lauding the extraordinary feat of the IAF as even the other instance recorded in recent Ukraine-Russia conflict was that of a shoot down at a distance of 200 km.He said, ""This is a significant fact because we have seen IAF deploying its S-400 surface-to-air missile system very close to the border to Pakistan, so close that it was actually firing missiles from within the range of Pakistani army's artillery, which meant if it would stay, its presence of the firing unit in question would have been detected by Pakistanis too early, Pakistanis could have shelled the area in question, hit and destroyed this firing unit. So it was quite a risky operation, actually.""Tom Cooper, like another well-known military strategist John Spencer, had earlier said that Operation Sindoor marked India's decisive victory.","Austria-based aerial warfare expert tom cooper has said that what acm singh said was just a ""confirmation of something that was more or less known since may"" cooper also endorsed the latter's statement about the s-400 surface-to-air missile hitting targets at a distance of 300 km.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123290039,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-572568,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Three Things To Note For India

Just a year ago, it would perhaps have taken a big leap of faith for PM Narendra Modi to travel to China. The two countries’ relationship was still on ventilator. The border was relatively quiet, but disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh was still incomplete.Now, as Modi gets ready to visit Tianjin later this month, it seems the most unambivalent thing to do, grounded in a realistic understanding of global uncertainties and the need to reinforce its multialignment.It helps, of course, that the agreement Modi reached with President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Brics summit in Oct — that disputes and differences would not be allowed to disturb border peace — has remained unimpaired. While India’s official announcement is awaited, Modi’s visit is all but certain; so is Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s to India next week for talks with NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar Granted, Modi’s visit is for a multilateral event: the summit meeting of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), a 10-member security-oriented Eurasian grouping dominated by China and Russia, seen as a potential counterweight to Nato. Modi’s last visit to China, in 2018, was also for the SCO summit.Given the state of its ties with China and Pakistan, India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).In 2023, it also backed out of an economic roadmap as it seemed more aligned with Chinese interests. More recently, India also refused to sign on to a joint statement condemning Israel’s attack on Iran.However, India acknowledges SCO’s role in combating terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, promoting connectivity that doesn’t undermine sovereignty and territorial integrity, and facilitating its own ties with Central Asia. Modi has used the SCO Heads of State Council meeting, the highest decision-making body of the organisation, to draw attention to cross-border terrorism, without naming Pakistan.SCO has also had an important role to play in bringing India and China together. Russia may not have actively mediated between India and China, but it has nudged both sides to use the forum to engage with each other after 2020’s Galwan clash.The Moscow Consensus, within three months of Galwan — on the margins of the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in the Russian capital — to ease tensions is a case in point. President Xi Jinping in 2023 also participated in the SCO summit Modi hosted virtually under India’s presidency.However, Modi has also skipped SCO summit meetings. He missed one in Kazakhstan last year. If Modi is travelling to China, it’s because he understands the salience Xi has attached to the Tianjin summit under China’s presidency, prioritising it over Brics this year, and the need to normalise a relationship that he believes is important not just for India and China, but the entire world. Support from China will also be crucial for India’s Brics presidency next year.Trump’s foreign policy has wrongfooted India but, to be fair to the Indian govt, India and China started to rebuild ties long before the US president sent the world careening towards an apocalyptic trade war. In fact, the agreement to end the military standoff in eastern Ladakh happened even before the US presidential elections.By visiting China, Modi is signalling that India is ready to have a sound working relationship with Beijing — as long as border peace and tranquillity is not disturbed. When NSA Doval visited China last Dec, both sides agreed to maintain peace on the ground so that “issues on the border do not hold back the normal development of bilateral relations”.India has not allowed China’s military cooperation with Pakistan — even after Operation Sindoor — to ruin the Sino-Indian thaw, and Beijing was muted in its criticism of India’s first joint patrolling of the South China Sea with the Philippines, suggesting a readiness from both sides to take a long view of the relationship. Modi’s bilateral meeting with Xi, which might see important announcements (such as the resumption of direct flights), is an opportunity for both sides to rebuild trust for a mutually beneficial partnership in areas like trade, investment and emerging technologies, in which China is a global leader.India will expect China to reciprocate by addressing some of its trade restrictions related to manpower and equipment that impact Indian manufacturing, and deliver on the promise to import more to reduce the $100 billion trade deficit. India will also be mindful of China’s efforts to undercut its influence in the neighbourhood and the larger Indo-Pacific. China will expect, as ambassador Xu Feihong toldrecently, a transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for its companies.The dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone. The way the relationship has peaked and troughed from the initial Modi years to the Doklam crisis, and again from the excitement over the informal summits to the Galwan despair, serves as an important lesson. The answer probably lies in Modi’s recent remark, quickly endorsed by Beijing, that competition should not be allowed to turn into conflict.Not really. Modi has, in the past, attended several SCO summits where he has met Xi — and all it has signified is India’s strategic autonomy. His upcoming visit to China is drawing more attention because of the state of India’s ties with the US.India and the US seemed set to embark on a new phase in the relationship, based on robust and next-generation defence and technology collaborations, along with stronger energy ties, when Trump dropped his tariff bomb, doubling the levy on India for its oil imports from Russia.But it will probably take more than one individual, even if he’s the US president, to do any structural damage to a relationship successive American presidents have called one of the most defining partnerships of the 21st century.Amid calls for India to take on the Trump administration, the govt itself has chosen to avoid confrontation. Trump is known to take maximalist positions ahead of trade agreements, and India is still willing to negotiate. India’s statement that the relationship has weathered such challenges in the past has been received well by the US State Department. The visit to China registers India’s position against Western unilateralism, but India is not giving up on America yet. A possible return of peace in Ukraine can also wipe out half of India’s tariff woes.There are three things India will guard against, though. The first is whether Trump, chasing a watershed trade deal with China, will remain as committed to the Indo-Pacific as he was during his previous term, when he revived Quad. The tariff issue has cast a shadow on the upcoming Quad summit India has to host in early Nov. If Trump doesn’t come, there will be questions raised about the US’s long-standing policy of dealing with India as a country that can ensure a sustainable balance of power in the region. India’s efforts to restore ties with China help it hedge against this eventuality.Second is the strong counterterrorism cooperation that will likely be diluted by Trump’s remarkable turnaround on Pakistan — from accusing it of hoodwinking US presidents on the issue of terrorism to treating it as a lodestar in the fight against the menace. Re-hyphenating India with Pakistan can potentially cause irreparable damage to relations with India.Third is the impending H-1B overhaul, and the likely impact on Indian professionals in the IT and healthcare sectors. This is sure to ignite another diplomatic firestorm, damaging people-to-people contacts and what India sees as a mutually beneficial economic and technology partnership.All three are issues that will test India’s resolve and push the limits of Indian diplomacy.","Pm narendra modi is set to visit tianjin later this month for the sco summit. India is a bit of an outlier in the group, as it doesn’t join others in endorsing initiatives like the bri (belt and road initiative) the dragon-elephant tango may have just started but, in these circumstances, it will remain accident-prone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123292405,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-596051,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The flow of Russian crude to India remains unabated in spite of discounts shrinking to $1.5-2 per barrel as market factors and input requirement continue to drive refiners’ choice in the absence of any govt directive for or against those imports amid US and European Union (EU) pressure.“We are buying crude as per the economics. We are not making any extra effort for either increasing or decreasing Russian crude (purchase),"" IndianOil chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said on Thursday.Coming from the head of India’s largest state-run refiner and a major buyer of Russian crude, the statement can be construed as an indication the govt remains undaunted by western pressure against purchase of those barrels.Govt sources said a team of officials from the external and commerce ministries is set to visit Russia for further discussion on a Rupee-Rouble trade, something both countries have been pursuing for years.Several cargoes of Russian crude was delivered to western ports last week, contrary to foreign media reports of India pausing purchase of Russian oil. Describing those reports as “wrong”, Sahney pointed out that Russian oil was not sanctioned like Iranian or Venezuelan crude but is only subject to a price cap.He said the US had set the price cap at $60/barrel, among other curbs, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The EU’s latest curbs has lowered the cap to $47 (at current oil prices). There is no curb on buying Russian oil within these conditions.Sahney said buying (clean) Russian oil even at small discounts could make sense for refiners if the yield patten of that particular grade suits the production plan at a given point. “If the pricing and characteristics of the crude suits our scheme of processing, we buy,” he said explaining the monthly variations in the quantity of imports from Russia or the US.Separately, executives of other refining companies said the wind-down provisions in the US penalty on New Delhi allow import of Russian crude loaded upto seven days from the order, after which the 25% additional tariff will be imposed on Indian goods exports.“We will continue to import Russian oil but will not violate the sanctions,” an executive of major refining company said requesting that neither he nor his company be identified.","The flow of russian crude to india remains unabated in spite of discounts shrinking to $1.5-2 per barrel. “we are buying crude as per the economics.

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday dismissed claims that it is pursuing de-dollarisation within Brics , saying such a move is “not part of India’s financial agenda.”“We have made our position very clear on this issue earlier as well. De-dollarisation is not part of India’s financial agenda,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at the weekly media briefing. His remarks followed Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s suggestion that Brics nations could explore a trade currency amid rising tensions with the United States over tariffs.Elaborating on the idea, Lula said it should be tested. “We can discuss in the Brics. There is a need to have a trade currency between us and the Brics. I do not reject it because we must test; if the testing fails, then I would be wrong. But someone has to convince me that I am wrong,” reported PTI, citing Russia Today.The remarks come amid escalating trade frictions with the US. Last week, US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, taking total duties to 50 per cent over India’s continued purchase of Russian crude oil. He had also announced a 50 per cent tariff on imports from Brazil last month and criticised the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.On Lula’s upcoming visit to India, Jaiswal said, “We had gone to Rio to attend the Brics summit. We also paid a state visit to Brasilia. And at that time, the Prime Minister, as is normal in bilateral ties, invited President Lula to visit India at an appropriate time.”India has emphasised that it will continue engaging with Brics countries on shared interests while safeguarding its economic and strategic priorities. “India is a member of the Brics group, and we continue to remain in touch with member countries to discuss issues of shared interest,” Jaiswal added.External affairs minister S Jaishankar clarified that India has not actively moved to reduce its reliance on the US dollar. Instead, the focus is on “derisking” trade by diversifying partners, exploring alternative payment systems, and reducing dependence on a single currency.India has also signed agreements with countries including Russia, the UAE, and the Maldives to settle trades in local currencies, mitigating currency conversion and exchange rate risks. The country opposes a common Brics currency with China and other members due to geographical differences and limited economic integration.",Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said de-dollarisation is not part of india’s financial agenda.

PM Modi to address the nation from Red Fort

Honouring the heroes of Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: As India marks 79 years of Independence, the nation begins celebration with an appeal for self-reliance and honour for its brave defenders. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom, looking ahead to progress from the historic Red Fort.On the 79th Independence Day, President Droupadi Murmu urged the nation to follow the spirit of ‘Swadeshi’, while gallantry awards for Operation Sindoor heroes added a tribute to those protecting the country.On the eve of Independence, President Droupadi Murmu urged citizens to “buy and use Indian-made products” to strengthen the spirit of the Swadeshi Movement.Linking the 1905 movement, strengthened by Mahatma Gandhi, to present-day initiatives, she said, “The idea of Swadeshi has been inspiring our national endeavours like Make-in-India initiative and Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. Let us resolve to buy and use Indian products.”She called on people to consciously choose local goods, emphasising that this would not only honour the legacy of the Swadeshi Movement but also empower millions of artisans across the country.The President also recalled how Gandhi promoted goods made through the sweat, toil and incomparable skills of Indian craftspeople.Referring to the recent National Handloom Day on August 7, she said it had been celebrated since 2015 to honour the country’s weavers and commemorate the Swadeshi Movement of 1905, which played a vital role in India’s freedom struggle.On the occasion of the 79th Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hoist the National Flag and address the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.
