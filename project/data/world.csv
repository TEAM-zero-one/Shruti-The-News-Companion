Shashi Throor’s son Ishaan among staff sacked by Washington Post; pens sombre note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-throors-son-ishaan-among-staff-sacked-by-washington-post-pens-sombre-note/articleshow/127922743.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation which includes shutting down its current Sports Desk and scaling back its international reportage footprint. According to Fox News, about a third of the organisation’s workforce has been affected, close to 300 people.Ishaan Tharoor, foreign affairs columnist at The Post and son of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, is among journalists laid off as part of a major restructuring at the US newspaper that has sharply reduced its international coverage.Tharoor said he was “heartbroken” after being laid off, sharing the news in a post on X on Wednesday. “I have been laid off today from the Washington Post, along with most of the International staff and so many other wonderful colleagues,” he wrote.“I’m heartbroken for our newsroom and especially for the peerless journalists who served the Post internationally – editors and correspondents who have been my friends and collaborators for almost 12 years. It’s been an honour to work with them,” Tharoor added.In a separate post, Tharoor described it as “a bad day,” sharing a photograph of an empty newsroom.He also reflected on launching the WorldView column in 2017, saying it had been an honour to help readers make sense of global affairs and thanking the column’s roughly half a million subscribers.Several senior journalists and foreign correspondents confirmed their exits on social media.Will Hobson, an investigative reporter focused on sports, said on X: “Some personal news: I’m among today’s Washington Post layoffs. It was a dream 11-year run as an investigative reporter focused on sports.”Gerry Shih, the Post’s Jerusalem bureau chief, said he was laid off along with much of the Middle East team and international staff across regions. “I’m gone along with the rest of the ME team and the majority of teammates from Delhi to Beijing to Kyiv & Latam,” he wrote, calling it a “sad day.”Cairo bureau chief Claire Parker said the entire roster of Middle East correspondents and editors had been affected. “Hard to understand the logic. But I am grateful for my incredible colleagues,” she wrote.Other journalists impacted include Visual Forensics staffer Nilo Tabrizy, Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson, and Berlin bureau chief Aaron Wiener, who said the Post had decided to eliminate its Berlin bureau. Johnson said she was “laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”National culture writer Jada Yuan and national politics reporter Brianna Tucker also spoke publicly about the layoffs, highlighting the personal and professional toll. “Thinking about my colleagues on the foreign desk living in war zones,” Yuan wrote.Former executive editor Marty Baron described the developments as among the most troubling in the newspaper’s history. “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations,” Baron was quoted as saying by The Wrap.Reports have also said the cuts include the closure of the Books section, the cancellation of the Post Reports podcast, and further reductions in Metro and international coverage.The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging Bezos to continue investing in the paper’s journalistic mission. “Without the staff of The Washington Post, there is no Washington Post,” the union said.","The washington post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation.

Piyush Goyal Defends India-US Trade Deal in Lok Sabha, Says Farmers And Dairy Interests Fully Safe

Evolving international dynamics at core of oil strategy: Goyal

NEW DELHI: Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal said in Parliament Wednesday that ensuring energy security of 1.4 billion Indians will be govt’s “supreme priority”, hinting that any change in crude suppliers will not lead to rise in pump price.Goyal said India had secured its “core sensitivities” in food and agriculture in the US deal. “Equally, this partnership will unlock new opportunities for MSMEs...skilled workers and industry, enable access to advanced tech, and support Make in India for the world,” he said, a day after the USTR was reported saying India had managed to protect its farm products.On choice of oil suppliers, the minister said: “Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this. All of India’s actions are taken with this in mind.”The remark stood out against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s claims that India had decided to stop the purchase of Russian oil to secure a trade deal.While Russia has remained India’s top source, its share of imports has come down as discounts fell. In recent years, India has begun sourcing oil from 41 countries, compared with 27 countries a few years ago.Separately, Russia said India is free to purchase oil from anywhere and media reports quoting the Russian foreign ministry said there is “no reason to believe that our Indian friends have reconsidered their approach” on buying oil. “We remain convinced that India’s purchase of Russian hydrocarbons is beneficial to both countries and contributes to maintaining stability in the international energy market. We are ready to continue close cooperation in this area with our partners in India,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said.Against punitive tariffs of 50% imposed by Trump, including a 25% “penalty” for India purchasing Russian crude, the US has now agreed to lower the additional levy to 18% under the bilateral trade agreement that has been in the works for close to a year.“I wish to underline that this rate is lower than the tariffs imposed by the US on several competing countries, thereby enhancing India’s export competitiveness in the US market.The agreement also provides significant comparative advantage to Indian exporters, particularly in labour-intensive sectors and manufacturing,” Goyal said.The US is India’s largest export destination.",Commerce & industry minister piyush goyal says ensuring energy security of 1.4 billion indians will be govt’s ‘supreme priority’ hints that any change in crude suppliers will not lead to rise in pump price.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127918631,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-161052,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: As India is finalising the details of its trade deal with the US, a report suggested that the Narendra Modi-led government was willing to wait out US President Donald Trump 's term for the trade agreement and Washington was also informed of the same.According to a report by news outlet Bloomberg, national security adviser Ajit Doval held a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in September last year and told him that India won't be bullied by Trump or his top aides.Doval told US officials that the Modi government was willing to wait out Trump's term, having faced other hostile US administrations in the past.Doval also told Rubio that New Delhi wanted Trump and his aides to dial down their public criticism of India so they could get relations back on track.This comes after the US President announced a trade deal with India on Monday, slashing tariffs from 50 per cent to 18 per cent.“It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi, of India, this morning.

Political Storm Erupts As Rahul Gandhi, Ravneet Bittu Clash, Cong Targets PM Modi On Epstein Files

Speaker slams oppn MPs for Naravane banners

Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi with Congress MPs Hibi Eden, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, CPI(M) MP S Venkatesan and other MPs who were suspended from the Lok Sabha on Tuesday for the remainder of the Budget session for ""unruly behaviour'', as they stage a protest with a poster �'PM is compromised'�, at Parliament premises in New Delhi.

Scared Modi ran away from House, claim oppn MPs

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday could not deliver his customary speech during the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address because of the adjournment forced by the opposition, whose women members charged towards the treasury benches raising slogans and holding banners.Modi was scheduled to reach Lok Sabha when presiding officer Sandhya Rai, in for Speaker Om Birla, adjourned the House for the day to avert a clash that had seemed imminent because of counter-mobilisation of members, especially women, by the governing side.Modi is now expected to speak in Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The adjournment was a fallout of the stand-off between the two sides over Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi ’s insistence on citing the unpublished book of former Army chief, Gen M M Naravane. The confrontation intensified due to what was seen as a tit-for-tat response by BJP member Nishikant Dubey, who sought to quote from books replete with unflattering references to members of the Gandhi-Nehru clan.Though the chair adjourned the House for the day, several opposition MPs questioned why Dubey was allowed speak. Congress members later met Speaker Birla and demanded his suspension.The House witnessed similar protests during the question hour, and amid din, Speaker Om Birla adjourned proceedings till 12 noon.When the House re-assembled, opposition MPs were on their feet raising slogans against the govt over the issue of stand-off with China in 2020, referring to certain matters related to the unpublished “memoir” of General Naravane.Congress members had brought banners and posters featuring Naravane and defence minister Rajnath Singh, while Rahul was seen flashing a book in the House.The Speaker urged members to maintain dignity of the House and slammed the opposition for displaying banners and posters. The House was then adjourned till 2 pm. Later, the House was adjourned till 5 pm following an uproar over Dubey’s remarks targeting the Gandhi family. It was adjourned for the day by Rai.After the PM’s no-show in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi said Narendra Modi feared being gifted General M M Naravane’s memoirs that narrate his account as Army chief during the 2020 Chinese aggression.Rahul remarked, “As I had said, PM will not come to LS because he does not want to face the truth.”Earlier Wednesday, Rahul dramatically posed in the Parliament complex with Naravane’s book “Four Stars to Destiny” that he was not allowed to cite in his speech on the motion of thanks to the President’s address, telling reporters, “I don’t think the PM will have the guts to come to LS today. If he comes, I will give him this book so that... he knows his reality.”After three days of logjam, the anti-BJP camp was excited that the PM had to back down from his scheduled speech for fear of disruptions. After the abrupt end to the evening’s proceedings, Trinamool Congress’ Kalyan Banerjee said, “He ran away for fear of the opposition.”Congress MP K C Venugopal said govt was making a mockery of Parliament, and the PM should be asked why he did not come for his speech. Congress MP Manickam Tagore said since the LOP was not allowed to speak in LS, the PM’s address too had to be cancelled. “This is the first time in parliamentary history... The united voice of 239 MPs will make India stronger,” he said.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also said Modi was too scared to come to the House. “The rail minister and Nishikant Dubey ran away like a bullet train,” she mocked.Quoting from the book to reporters, Rahul alleged Modi had abdicated responsibility during the Ladakh crisis. He said Naravane has said that he felt abandoned. He said the govt was now trying to deny the very existence of the book despite it being in the public domain.Rahul added that every young Indian should read the retired General’s detailed first-hand account of events in Ladakh.","Pm narendra modi could not deliver his customary speech during the debate on the motion of thanks to the president’s address because of the adjournment forced by the opposition.

From Minerals Gift To Diplomatic Snub: Pakistan Misses Out On Key US Meet While India Takes Seat

The online reckoning

Why this cut so deep

PM Modi and Trump

The received wisdom in Washington circles has been that Pakistan has ‘played’ Donald Trump better than its Indian counterpart. This has included praising Donald Trump to high heavens at every turn, nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize with every breath, offering him (snake?) oil, and in general agreeing to anything including joining the Board of Peace.Perhaps, Pakistan felt it had returned to its older role of indispensable intermediary as New Delhi remained the insouciant child who refused to bow to Trump’s diktats. Overnight, the illusion shattered as Trump announced the US had reached a trade agreement with India lowering tariffs on India’s exports to 18%. While most of the details about the deal are still being worked out, that didn’t stop a full-blown meltdown on Pakistani (or South Asian) Twitter.One viral tweet summed up the mood: “Mover, shaker, and beggars.”That line became a shorthand for something deeper than trade arithmetic. The reaction in Pakistan was not about supply chains or tariff schedules. It was about hierarchy.The first wave of reactions was disbelief. Then came sarcasm. Then came something closer to anger, much of it directed inward. Pakistani social media users began listing, almost ritualistically, the many ways Islamabad had publicly courted Trump.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination resurfaced again and again, often framed as a punchline. So did Pakistan’s enthusiastic endorsement of Trump’s various peace initiatives and grand visions.A widely circulated post laid it out bluntly: Pakistan did everything to please Trump, including nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, joining his “Board of Peace”, and offering cooperation on minerals. Yet India, which spent months resisting Trump’s pressure, ended up with a lower tariff rate. To make matters worse, users pointed out, India had also just secured major trade concessions with the European Union.The tone shifted quickly from disbelief to gallows humour. One viral image showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Asim Munir holding up an AI-styled magazine cover featuring Modi and Trump, both leaders pointing at the image as if presenting evidence of a reality they could not alter. The accompanying Urdu caption roughly translated to: “Asim Munir is stuck between them… the world has moved on.”Across Facebook and Instagram, memes treated the 18% versus 19% tariff gap like a scoreboard. Comment threads were filled with variations of the same lament: how did bending over backwards still lead to being sidelined? Why did obedience not translate into leverage?Even YouTube reaction videos, often noisy and incoherent, showed an unusual convergence. Commenters questioned the entire premise of Pakistan’s Trump strategy. If this was the payoff for flattery, many asked, what exactly had been achieved?For months, Pakistan’s elite discourse had convinced itself that India-US relations were deteriorating while Pakistan-US ties were stabilising. Trump’s public irritation with India was misread as strategic rupture. Pakistan’s warmth was read as influence. Proximity was mistaken for power.The trade deal punctured that narrative decisively. What Pakistan’s discourse missed was that India’s apparent indifference was not neglect. It was posture.New Delhi did not merely refuse to flatter Trump; it actively declined to participate in his theatre. Reporting through last year showed that as tariff tensions escalated, India chose distance over desperation. At the height of the standoff, international media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi declined to take multiple phone calls from Trump, an almost unheard-of move in the choreography of great-power diplomacy. Silence, in this case, was not accidental. It was communicative.That frostiness surfaced more clearly in what would become the last direct exchange between the two leaders. According to reporting by The New York Times, a June phone call turned sour when Trump claimed credit for de-escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and floated the familiar Nobel Peace Prize rhetoric. New Delhi pushed back firmly, insisting that India and Pakistan had managed matters bilaterally, without US mediation. After that call, the two leaders did not speak again for months.That, in hindsight, is what makes the trade deal so destabilising for Pakistan’s narrative. India did not win by courting Trump better. It won by not courting him at all.","Pakistan felt it had returned to its older role of indispensable intermediary as new delhi remained the insouciant child who refused to bow to trump's diktats.

Oppn Women MPs Storm Treasury Benches Amid Protests: Inside PM Modi's Lok Sabha Speech Cancellation

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday said that the bigger issue was that leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to speak in the Lok Sabha rather than the prime minister not being able to do so, as the PM's reply depended on questions raised by the LoP, and without them, no debate could take place.Speaking to reporters after a meeting of Congress floor leaders, senior party leader Jairam Ramesh said, “If the LoP does not speak, what is the point of a debate? The prime minister replies to the debate. If the debate hasn’t taken place, what will the PM speak on?”He added, “We know the prime minister will make an election-style speech. That is what he has been doing for the last 11 years. He will criticise the Congress and its leadership, and target Nehru.

India-US trade deal will hurt farmers, agriculture sector at risk: Kharge

Lok Sabha adjourned: PM Modi doesn't want to face the truth, says Rahul

Both Houses of Parliament witnessed repeated disruptions on Wednesday amid continued opposition protests and clashes with ruling party MPs. The Lok Sabha was adjourned multiple times amid sloganeering, banners and placards displayed by Congress and other opposition members, including allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and criticism over the India–US trade deal.During the day, several incidents drew attention. Rahul Gandhi was seen outside the House holding a memoir of former Army Chief Naravane, and later engaged in a heated exchange with Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu.Inside the House, Union minister Piyush Goyal defended the India-US trade deal, saying India had “successfully safeguarded” agriculture and dairy sectors, while Mallikarjun Kharge warned it could harm Indian farmers and benefit American producers.Lok Sabha was adjourned soon after resuming at 5 pm. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's response to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address was also cancelled.The Lok Sabha was adjourned on Wednesday amid heavy sloganeering by Opposition members, who were protesting outside Parliament with posters reading “PM is compromised.” The protests followed the suspension of eight Opposition MPs during the Budget Session a day earlier.The House resumed at 12.00 pm.The suspended MPs include Congress members Hibi Eden, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, Manickam Tagore, Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Prashant Yadaorao Padole, Chamala Kiran Kumar Reddy, and Dean Kuriakose, as well as CPI(M) MP S Venkatesan. Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi had repeated the allegation while speaking to the media on the India–US trade agreement.Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal defended the India–US bilateral trade agreement in the Lok Sabha, saying India had “successfully safeguarded” its sensitive sectors, especially agriculture and dairy, after nearly a year of negotiations.Goyal said it was natural for both countries to protect their critical interests and that negotiations over the past year had led to finalisation of several areas of the agreement.Referring to a recent phone call between PM Modi and US President Donald Trump, Goyal said Trump announced a tariff reduction to 18 per cent, stressing that this was “lower than the US tariff on several competitor nations”.Rahul Gandhi, and union minister of state for Railways, Ravneet Singh Bittu, engaged in a heated exchange outside Parliament on Wednesday, with Gandhi calling Bittu a “traitor.”The incident occurred as Bittu passed by protesting Congress MPs at the Makar Dwar. Gandhi’s remark came in the context of Bittu leaving Congress and joining the BJP in 2024. Gandhi said, “Here is a traitor walking right by. Look at the face.” He even offered to shake Bittu’s hand, adding, “Hello, brother, my traitor friend. Don’t worry, you will come back (to Congress).”Bittu refused the handshake and responded by calling Gandhi “Desh ke dushman (enemy of the state).” The exchange reportedly began after Bittu commented on the protesting MPs, saying, “They are sitting as if they won a war.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor slipped and fell while coming down the stairs at the Parliament complex. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, along with other MPs and staff members, immediately helped him get back on his feet.Opposition and BJP MPs had a heated exchange in Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s office on Wednesday following remarks made by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey targeting the Gandhi family.After the Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned, Congress MPs met the Speaker to protest the Chair’s decision to allow Dubey to speak on the issue in the House. They objected to his remarks and raised concerns over the manner in which the matter was taken up during the session.Earlier during the proceedings, Dubey had referred to several books and spoke about their contents related to different members of the Gandhi family. He said that while Rahul Gandhi wanted to speak about an unpublished book, he had brought multiple published books to present what he described as material against the Gandhi family.Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the proposed India–US trade deal would harm Indian farmers and damage the country’s agriculture sector.He said the deal would benefit American farmers at the cost of Indian interests and criticised the government, saying it was an insult to Parliament that lawmakers learnt about the deal during the ongoing session from US President Donald Trump, and not from the Indian government.Kharge quoted US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who had said that the new India–US deal would allow American farm products access to India’s large markets, raise prices and bring more income to rural America.Lok Sabha was adjourned shortly after it reassembled at 5 pm, amid indications that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could respond later to the debate on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address.The House went into chaos as soon as the proceedings began at 5pm. Congress MPs entered the well and aisles and raised slogans over the suspension of eight MPs. Several women MPs from the opposition blocked the seats in the treasury bench, including the seat of the Prime Minister.Congress MP Rahul Gandhi shared a video on social media, claiming he had rightly predicted the Prime Minister would not come to Parliament as he was “scared” and unwilling to face the truth.Reacting to the adjournment, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari alleged that opposition members had surrounded the Prime Minister’s chair when the House assembled in the evening, saying they had come with the intention to attack him.","Both houses of parliament witnessed repeated disruptions on wednesday amid continued opposition protests and clashes with ruling party mps.

Operation 'Kiya': Two terrorists killed in Udhampur



NEW DELHI: A terrorist was killed on Wednesday evening during an ongoing anti-terror operation in the Kishtwar region of Jammu and Kashmir, the officials said.The encounter took place under Operation 'Trashi-I', as security forces continued their search for terrorists hiding in the area.In a post on X, the Army's White Knight Corps said contact was re-established with terrorists on the run at around 5.45 pm in the Dichhar area of Kishtwar.""In the continuing search and elimination of terrorists in the Kishtwar region, where the hunt has already led to several contacts in the dense forests and challenging terrain, contact was re-established with the terrorists on the run in the ongoing joint Operation Trashi-I by the troops of Counter-Insurgency Force Delta, White Knight Corps, J&K Police and CRPF at around 5.45 pm today in the general area of Dichhar, Kishtwar,"" the post said.""One terrorist has been successfully neutralised.

Several powerful blasts were heard when forces stormed the cave around noon.One of the slain terrorists was identified as Rubani alias Abu Mavia, a self-styled top JeM commander active in the area for several years. While one body was found at the mouth of the cave, the other was recovered from deep inside.The terrorists were located by joint teams of the Army, police and CRPF during intensified searches in the higher reaches of the Ramnagar-Basantgarh area around 4 pm on Tuesday, triggering a fierce gunfight.The Army named the over 20-hour-long operation ""Kiya"", saying that while the operation has concluded, the area remains under surveillance.""Based on specific intelligence input provided by police, troops of Counter-Intelligence Force Delta, White Knight Corps planned and executed a focused joint counter-terror operation in the general area of Jophar Forest, Basantgarh in coordination with police and CRPF reinforcing the cordon, ensuring effective area domination to prevent escape of terrorists,"" the Army’s White Knight Corps had earlier said.""Contact with terrorists was established yesterday and since then, terrorists were prevented from breaking contact. Following a calibrated and coordinated response, two terrorists have been successfully neutralised. The operation highlighted seamless inter-agency coordination, tactical precision and high standards of professionalism,"" it added.A large quantity of arms and ammunition, including an M4 carbine and an AK assault rifle, were recovered from the slain terrorists.A series of encounters, three in Kathua district and four in the Chatroo forest belt in Kishtwar, took place in January as part of intensified operations in the upper reaches of the Jammu region. These resulted in the killing of top JeM terrorist Usman of Pakistan in Kathua and the death of a paratrooper in Kishtwar.Usman was part of the same group eliminated in Udhampur and had got separated following the Soan encounter, officials said.","A terrorist was killed on wednesday evening during an ongoing anti-terror operation in the kishtwar region of jammu and kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday stirred a fresh controversy after he took a jibe at BJP MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and called him ""traitor friend.""While protesting at the Makar Dwar of the parliament complex over the suspension of Congress MPs, Rahul and Bittu engaged in a verbal altercation.

— Mallikarjun Kharge (@kharge) February 4, 2026





NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Wednesday raised questions over the way the India–US trade deal was announced, saying the government had failed to take Parliament and the public into confidence despite the House being in session.In a post on X, Kharge said India and the United States have shared a strong global strategic partnership for several years, rooted in common democratic values.He pointed to the Indo–US civil nuclear agreement signed during the tenure of former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh as an example of transparent and accountable decision-making. Kharge said the Congress-led UPA government had kept Parliament informed at every stage while finalising that landmark deal.He contrasted this with the present situation, saying the country knows “nothing” about the trade agreement announced by US President Donald Trump.Kharge noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public response focused only on thanking Trump for cutting tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, without offering any details of the deal itself.“Parliament is in session, but the Modi government chose an outside platform to talk about the deal, without sharing any specifics,” Kharge said in his post.The Congress chief flagged three major concerns that, according to him, remain unanswered. He asked whether India had made any compromises under pressure from the United States and whether New Delhi had agreed to zero tariffs on American imports, as claimed by President Trump.Kharge also sought clarity on the impact of the deal on Indian farmers, questioning whether the agriculture sector had been fully or partially opened to US agricultural products.In addition, he raised concerns about energy ties with Moscow, asking whether India would stop buying oil from Russia and what message, if any, had been conveyed to the Russian side.The Kremlin stated on Tuesday that it has not received any official communication from New Delhi regarding the suspension of crude oil trade.“Parliament and 140 crore people of India have the right to know,” Kharge said.The questions come amid growing political debate over the India–US trade framework, under which Washington has agreed to lower tariffs on Indian exports to 18 per cent from much higher levels. The agreement has been announced at the framework level, with several details yet to be made public.Defending the deal in the Lok Sabha, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said India had successfully protected its sensitive sectors, especially agriculture and dairy, after nearly a year of negotiations.He said discussions had been ongoing since Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US in February 2025 and that the final outcome was balanced and mutually beneficial. Goyal also stressed that energy security remained a top priority for the government.Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi intensified his attack on the Prime Minister, alleging that PM Modi was “under pressure” and had been “compromised” in finalising the deal.The Congress has demanded that the full details of the trade agreement be placed before Parliament, particularly on agriculture, tariffs and India’s oil purchases from Russia.",Congress president mallikarjun kharge raises questions over the way the india–us trade deal was announced.

Rahul Gandhi Vs Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah In Lok Sabha Over Doklam Claims From Ex Army Chief Memoir

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha witnessed a major showdown on Monday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi rose to speak during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address.Rahul Gandhi began his speech by quoting excerpts from the memoir of former Army chief General MM Naravane, triggering immediate objections from defence minister Rajnath Singh and home minister Amit Shah Both ministers protested on procedural grounds, arguing that the book had not yet been officially published and therefore could not be cited in the House.The Congress leader, however, insisted that the document he was referring to was “authentic” and that he was well within his rights to quote from it. He said he had not originally intended to raise the issue, but decided to do so after BJP MP Tejasvi Surya questioned the patriotism of the Congress party earlier in the debate.“No debate on who is patriotic and who is not. Our patriotism is not buried,” Rahul said.Rajnath Singh countered the reference, maintaining that the memoir had not been published and therefore could not be brought into parliamentary proceedings.Home minister Amit Shah also hit back sharply. “I listened carefully to the speech of the honourable Member of Parliament, Tejasvi Surya. At no point did he question the nationalism or character of the Opposition,” Shah said.“In his speech, referring to the period from 2004 to 2014, he spoke about nationalism, the country’s culture and language, and said that these were not upheld by the government during that time. He did not question the nationalism or character of the Opposition anywhere… Secondly, leaders of the Opposition are saying they are not being allowed to speak, while they themselves are violating Rule 389. How do we want to run the House?” Shah added.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla intervened, citing parliamentary rules that prohibit quoting from books or newspaper clippings on matters not directly related to House proceedings.Rahul said, “Speaker sir, please tell me which rule says I cannot speak on India-China relations.”“The defence minister, home minister and the Prime Minister raise questions on our party, party leaders, and our nationalism. This article writes about the PM’s character… This is neither about China, nor the PM,” Rahul said.The Lok Sabha Speaker responded to LoP in Lok Sabha, “Honourable members, the subject listed for discussion does not include India or China. It is expected that we all uphold the dignity of the House and the country. You are also expected not to raise issues that may harm the nation’s prestige.”To which Rahul responded, “So are you saying that the Presidential Address has nothing to do with international relations? That we cannot speak about Pakistan, China, or any other country?”Opposition members, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, also accused the government of not allowing the LoP to complete his speech, leading to loud exchanges across the House. As the uproar intensified, Speaker Birla eventually adjourned the Lok Sabha.Earlier in the day, BJP MP Tejasvi Surya, while seconding the Motion of Thanks, had launched a sharp attack on the Congress-led UPA government, describing the period from 2004 to 2014 as a “decade of lost opportunities” and a “narrative of excuses”. He argued that the contrast between “weak leadership” and “great leadership” clearly set apart the Congress and the BJP.",Rahul gandhi began his speech by quoting excerpts from the memoir of former army chief general mm naravane.

50 Cent takes shots at Floyd Mayweather Jr as the boxer looks ahead at the lawsuit



The renowned American rapper 50 Cent and boxing icon Floyd Mayweather Jr were once close friends. Their bond grew strong in the early 2000s, when both were at the peak of their careers. Over time, their relationship broke down. Money problems and business disagreements created a deep rift in the once close friendship. Since then, the two have exchanged public insults. The duo have often clashed and engaged in verbal spat. 50 Cent has often used social media to mock Mayweather, especially questioning his business decisions and intelligence.Recently, the feud returned to the spotlight after fresh reports about Mayweather’s legal troubles. The retired boxer is said to be suing Showtime and its former president, Stephen Espinoza. He hopes to recover millions of dollars. The news quickly caught 50 Cent’s attention. The rapper used the moment to once again attack his former friend, adding fuel to a rivalry that refuses to fade!According to TMZ Sports, Floyd Mayweather Jr believes he has lost around $340 million due to a fraud scheme. He has accused his former advisor Al Haymon of being involved in the scandal. However, Haymon is not named in the lawsuit. Mayweather claims the financial damage came during his long partnership with Showtime. This legal move has raised questions, especially since Mayweather reportedly earned over $1 billion during his boxing career.50 Cent reacted in his usual blunt style on his official Instagram account. He mocked Mayweather’s situation and suggested that he was warned long ago. In a harsh post, the rapper joked that the boxer should stop complaining and return to the ring to earn money again. He hinted that Mayweather might need to fight Mike Tyson first. He also joked about other big-money fights, suggesting that Mayweather’s troubles were caused by his own poor choices.While the legal story made headlines, talk of another exhibition fight also surfaced. Mayweather has retired from professional boxing but still appears in exhibition bouts. He has already fought Logan Paul. Now, rumors suggest a possible showdown with Mike Tyson. Notably, Tyson has also returned for exhibitions, including a bout against Jake Paul that streamed on Netflix.","50 cent takes shots at floyd mayweather jr as the boxer looks ahead at the lawsuit against showtime. 50 cent has often used social media to mock mayweather, especially questioning his business decisions and intelligence.

Kevin Johnson’s past and the growing fear of a pattern

Kevin Johnson’s death is no longer being treated as just another tragic killing in Los Angeles. It is now part of a much bigger and far more troubling investigation. The former NFL defensive lineman was found dead on January 21 inside a homeless encampment in South Los Angeles. Investigators say he suffered blunt force trauma to the head and multiple stab wounds. That detail alone raised alarms. Now, police believe his murder may be linked to other violent deaths in the same area.According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, detectives are looking closely at whether Johnson’s killing connects to at least three other deaths involving unhoused people. All of the cases happened within a few blocks of each other. The timeline also stands out, stretching from fall 2025 into early 2026. Because of these similarities, authorities are asking a hard question. Are these random attacks, or is someone deliberately targeting people living in encampments?Kevin Johnson once played professional football at the highest level. He played defensive tackle in the NFL during the 1990s for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Oakland Raiders. After that, he continued his career in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and the Los Angeles Avengers.Over time, Johnson fell on difficult days. Authorities say he was living in the same encampment where he was later killed. Investigators believe his death happened during a violent attack, not an accident.What has shaken detectives is what followed. The Sheriff’s Department confirmed it is reviewing three other deaths that happened nearby over the past few months. In one case, a victim was shot. In another, a person was beaten to death.
