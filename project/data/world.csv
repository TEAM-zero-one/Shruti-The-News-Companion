MUMBAI: The rupee weakened on Friday due to dollar demand from maturing offshore positions and corporate hedging. It closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close. Falling equities added to the pressure. Elevated dollar demand weighed intraday, though sporadic dollar sales near the lows capped losses and kept sentiment cautious.“The rupee weakened, pressured by weakness in domestic equity markets and continued foreign investor selling. Volatility in the dollar index, driven by key US economic data, has further weighed on the currency,” said Jateen Trivedi of LKP Securities.","The rupee closed at 90.16 per dollar, 14 paise down from its previous close.

The unsung heroes of espionage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-unsung-heroes-of-espionage/articleshow/126436503.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. As Operation Absolute Resolve, which captured the Venezuelan President in a 30-minute manoeuvre, stunned, my thoughts turned to something else. Without well planted spies in Venezuela, this would have never been possible for the US. Spying is as ancient as the first kingdom that feared its neighbour. Egyptian scouts moved like wraiths through enemy camps. Sun Tzu, the 500 BCE philosopher, writes in his book ‘Art of War’, ‘Empires rise and fall on whispered intelligence. Whether the object is to crush an army, storm a city, or assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the aides-de-camp, servants, and doorkeepers through espionage.” Nearly 2000 years ago, Thiruvalluvar gazed into the heart of warfare and saw the same truth. In Kural 585, he captures the essence of the perfect spy in verses that shimmer with ancient wisdom: ""Kadaa Uruvodu Kannanjanjaadhu Yaandhum Ugaamai Valladhe Otru."" Of unsuspected disguise and all-unfearing eyes, who lets No secret out, are trusty spies. The sequences in the recent Bollywood spy movie Dhurandhar awakened a deep reverence for those valiant knights who work in darkness and shadows, unnamed and uncredited, who die without gun salutes or state honours. Saraswathy Rajamani was sixteen when fire entered her soul. Netaji's call to the Indian National Army rang through her privileged world, and with five other girls, she joined his army. They became spies in British households, dressed as boys, taking menial jobs that rendered them invisible. They served tea while empires schemed. And they listened. Every scrap of intelligence flowed back to INA headquarters. Each girl carried a gun and an instruction: if caught, end your life. When one was arrested but was unable to kill herself, Saraswathy walked into a military barracks as herself, a teenage girl. She drugged the officer on duty and vanished with her captured friend as police bullets tore into her legs. Not every tale is as dramatic. Kashmir Singh went to Pakistan on a mission that swallowed him whole. Caught by their intelligence service, he spent 35 years in their prisons—17 of them chained to a post in a lightless cell. Ravindra Kaushik achieved what intelligence agencies dream of—he became a deep cover agent planted within the Pakistani army itself. RAW trained him and sent him across the border where he rose through enemy ranks to the position of major. Until the mask slipped and he was caught, tortured and sentenced to death—erased as if he had never existed. There are legends that slip through the cracks of classified files too. Ajit Doval, now our National Security Advisor, once crossed into China to negotiate with the Mizoram Liberation Army chief. And then there is Sehmat. We don't know her real name. Perhaps we never will. Harinder Sikka's novel Calling Sehmat brought to life in the Bollywood movie Raazi , tells the tale of a 19-year-old girl asked by her dying father to become a bride and a weapon simultaneously. She married into a Pakistani military family, and during the 1971 war, passed intelligence so critical it saved INS Vikrant, the aircraft carrier, from destruction. But such salvation demands sacrifice measured in souls. She killed a servant who grew suspicious, and her brother-in-law who asked too many questions. She returned to India carrying her Pakistani husband's child—a son who would grow up to serve in the Indian Army. These are the invisible warriors Thiruvalluvar honoured. We may never know them. But we breathe free because they chose to suffocate in darkness.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Trump tariff trial: What happens if US duties are struck down?

What tariff refunds are the stakeholders expecting?

'Not guaranteed a refund'

The ongoing Supreme Court trial on US President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs has left companies, customs brokers and trade lawyers preparing for a potentially prolonged battle over refunds that could total close to $150 billion.The court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, though it has not specified which cases will be decided. The challenge revolces around Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a statute historically used to sanction foreign adversaries or freeze assets, to levy tariffs, according to Reuters. Trump is the first US president to apply the law for this purpose.Scepticism among both conservative and liberal justices during November’s oral arguments has fuelled expectations that the tariffs may be struck down, with questions raised over whether IEEPA grants the authority to impose such duties.Between February 4 and December 14, tariffs imposed under the emergency law generated an estimated $133.5 billion in collections, based on US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. Using average daily collections from late September to mid-December, Reuters estimated the total has since climbed towards $150 billion.Customs officials have made a recent technical change that has raised cautious optimism among importers.On January 2, CBP announced that tariff refunds would move entirely to electronic distribution through its ACE portal from February 6. While this stops short of a fully automated system, it suggests administrative readiness.“It does kind of signal that Customs is fully prepared to move forward with refunds, if the Supreme Court does, in fact, rule that way,” said Angela Lewis, global head of customs at logistics firm Flexport.CBP did not respond to questions on how it would handle an adverse ruling but said eliminating paper cheques would speed up payments and reduce fraud and errors. The US Treasury, which routinely processes hundreds of billions of dollars in tax refunds annually, also declined to comment on how tariff refunds would be managed.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the outcome of the case could be unclear but indicated that any loss of tariff revenue could be offset through other legal authorities. Speaking in Minneapolis, he said a ruling against Trump’s tariffs would mean “the president loses flexibility to use tariffs, both for national security, for negotiating leverage.”Trump introduced the IEEPA tariffs through two separate actions. In April, he announced “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from most US trading partners, citing a national emergency linked to trade deficits. Earlier, in February and March, tariffs were imposed on China, Canada and Mexico over fentanyl trafficking and illicit drugs, according to Reuters.Legal experts say the refund process will depend heavily on whether the Supreme Court provides explicit instructions or sends the issue back to a lower court, most likely the Court of International Trade. Under US rules, importers typically have 314 days to amend entries before they are “liquidated”, after which refunds are barred, a deadline that has already passed for some Chinese imports affected in February 2025.Despite the scale of potential repayments, companies fear that even a ruling against the tariffs will not automatically translate into refunds.“It's not in the government's DNA to give back money. And Trump would not want to give back money,” said Jim Estill, chief executive of Danby Appliances. The Canadian firm sells refrigerators, microwaves and laundry equipment through major US retailers, including Home Depot, and sources products from China and other Asian countries affected by the tariffs. Estill said Danby has paid about $7 million in duties and warned that recovering the money could trigger disputes further down the supply chain. “It's just going to be a dog's breakfast,” he said.To protect their positions, several companies have taken pre-emptive legal action against CBP. Costco said in court filings that even if the tariffs are ruled unlawful, importers “are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs” without judicial intervention. Similar lawsuits have been filed by Bumble Bee Foods, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, Kawasaki Motors and Yokohama Tire, Reuters reported.Some smaller businesses are opting out of the wait entirely, selling their refund claims to hedge funds at steep discounts in a fast-growing secondary market. Toymaker Kids2 said it received 23 cents on the dollar for reciprocal tariffs and just nine cents for those tied to fentanyl-related duties.Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Tonka trucks, Care Bears and K’Nex toys, said he doubts the company will recover the $6 million it paid in tariffs ahead of the Christmas sales season. He expects the administration to “obfuscate or delay” payments even if refunds are ordered. While he has not sold the claim, he said he would consider it if it meant faster repayment.“The last thing the American public wants to know is a bunch of slick Wall Street or predatory-lender types will come and make a fortune off all this,” Foreman said.Advisers are urging companies to act quickly and keep detailed documentation. Pete Mento, a trade advisory director at Baker Tilly, said firms will likely need to demonstrate they paid IEEPA-based duties before any refund is issued. “The people that get their claims in early and have them done correctly are the ones who are going to reap the benefits the fastest,” he said. “And, knowing the way the processes work in Washington, it could be years before you see that money. ”","Supreme court to rule on us president donald trump's use of emergency powers to impose global tariffs.

India-US trade figures



US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick made a big statement over why the India-US trade deal is not sealed yet, claiming that it was due to PM Modi not calling Trump. Speaking at the All-In Podcast, hosted by Chamath Palihapitiya, Lutnick said, ""Let's be clear, it's his deal. He's the closer. He does the deal. So I said, you got to have Modi. It's all set up. You have to have Modi...they were uncomfortable doing it.""""So Modi didn't call,"" he claimed.This statement comes after US President Donald Trump, on Thursday, approved a bill that can impose at least 500% tariffs for countries buying Russian oil, aiming to ""punish them."" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill would give US tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil.In February, leaders from both countries directed officials to begin negotiations, setting an initial goal of completing the first phase by autumn 2025. However the deal still remains stalled with India's trade with Russia remaining a major flashpoint.Back in August, US imposed additional tariffs on Indian imports to the country alleging that New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil was fueling Moscow's 'war machine' in Ukraine.Since then total tariffs on Indian goods stand at 50%, including 25% of additional tariffs and 25% of Trump's reciprocal tariffs.Since then, two nations have held many rounds of trade talks with the meeting back from December 10 to December 12, when US officials visited New Delhi. India and the US are engaged in parallel negotiations, aiming to develop a framework trade deal to address tariff issues, and focus on a comprehensive trade agreement.The proposed agreement aims to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 from the current $191 billion.The US remained India’s largest trading partner for the fourth consecutive year in 2024–25, with bilateral trade standing at $131.84 billion, of which $86.5 billion came from Indian exports. The American market accounts for roughly 18% of India’s total goods exports, 6.22% of its imports, and 10.73% of overall merchandise trade.Exporters have highlighted the need to finalise the agreement, noting that India’s merchandise exports to the US fell for a second straight month in October, declining 8.58% to $6.3 billion, largely due to the steep tariffs imposed by Washington.","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick made a big statement over why the india-us trade deal is not sealed yet.

Emergency visa appointment





An H-1B and H-4 visa holders are facing inordinate delays in India after social media vetting started since December 15, immigration experts said they are flooded with questions on whether H-1B holders can travel to India for any emergency, family function, or wedding without worrying about how to re-enter the country. In December 2025, hundreds of visa appointments were canceled and rescheduled to March 2026, April onwards. Those who have their visa stamping interviews scheuled in April 2026 and have made some plans around it don't know whether they should travel to India or whether April dates will also be deferred.Immigration attorney Rahul Reddy said those who are planning to travel to India for visa stamping and can't enter the US without a new visa stamping should not take a chance to travel to India even in April, as there are chances that those appointments might get deferred. And if they are traveling, then they must be prepared for a long stay as nobody knows how much time it will take and what new rules will come into effect.US consular offices occasionally grant emergency visa slots when a person has an urgent, unforeseen circumstance and cannot wait for the regular appointment date. The approval varies from case to case but only of there are slots. Reddy said he knows no one who did not apply for an emergency visa appointment slot in India but there is none.Reddy explained that when someone cites family emergency, the emergency is theirs to reach India and the US administration is not stopping anyone from travelling to India. Visa officers won't care to take up any family emergency case urgently because there is no emergency to return to the US. And if one loses their job while they are in India, chances of them getting hired by another company is lean, the attorney warned, as the new company will have to file a petition and pay the $100,000 H-1B petition fee.","In december 2025, hundreds of visa appointments were canceled and rescheduled to march 2026, april onwards.

In Fiery UK Conclave Speech, Suhel Seth Says India Has Evolved Beyond 1947, Now Shapes Global Power

NEW DELHI: In a move to shed yet another colonial relic, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Friday announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the British Raj — black prince coats (bandhgala coats) — saying that “we have to find every trace of colonialism and banish them”.TOI has learnt that govt is carrying out a larger exercise across the board to identify similar colonial hangovers — attire and ceremonial rites — such as convocation gowns and caps (robe and mortarboard) which are de rigueur at university conovations and bandhgalas officers have to mandatorily wear at formal receptions. In some states personnel attached to district collectors and mayors in some states are required to wear a certain pattern of dress.Speaking at an event to honour railway officials and the zone for their exemplary works, Vaishnaw said, “We have to get rid of all colonial mindset. We need to find each of them and remove them whether it’s in our working style or dressing style. Today (Friday) I am making the first announcement. Humare jo band gale ka kala suit angrezon chalu kiya tha, aaj se yeh railway mein formal dress nehin rahegi. (From today onwards, the black prince coats that the British introduced will no longer be a part of formal dress in railways).Officials said that PM Narendra Modi has asked ministers and top bureaucrats to identify the colonial practices and to suggest alternatives that are of Indian origins and reflect the country's culture.While the practice of convocation gowns and caps has been fading, some institutions have held on to it despite the ceremonial gear not being suited for India’s hot and humid conditions and despite protests from students and faculty. Officials said that more practices, which are not commonly known to many, may be identified during consultations.Sources did not rule out the possibility of a nudge to do away with black coats and gowns that lawyers are required to wear as per Advocates Act, 1961 continuing a tradition inherited from the British legal system where it symbolised authority, dignity, and a commitment to justice. This law formalised the British-era custom, requiring advocates to wear the black robe with a white neckband for uniformity and gravity in court.",Railway minister ashwini vaishnaw announced discontinuing the railway uniforms introduced by the british raj.

'PM Modi-Trump Held 8 Calls In 2025': India Rejects Lutnick's Claim On Stalled Trade Agreement

In the wake of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick's claim on a podcast that the bilateral trade deal wasn't signed as PM Modi didn't call President Donald Trump, the Indian authorities have maintained that the deal could not materialise last summer due to the Trump administration's insistence on lowering tariffs on farm and dairy products and demands for allowing genetically modified products, which are ""no-go areas"" for govt. With New Delhi not agreeing to Trump's terms, US slapped a 50% tariff on Indian goods, citing Russian oil and defence imports, and has refused to move on fresh offers shared by India.Asked about the US president clearing a bill allowing up 500% tariff on countries importing Russian oil, MEA said India's energy policy was guided by market dynamics and securing energy from diverse sources to meet its requirements. In the past, govt has said that it is open to higher energy imports from US to address concerns over India having a large trade surplus.Lutnick had said on the podcast that India ""did not grab the opportunity the US presented"" and waited too long to conclude negotiations, only to later seek terms comparable to those secured by UK. By then, he said, the moment had passed.At the heart of Lutnick's explanation is what he called Trump's ""staircase"" model of trade negotiations - a strategy designed to reward speed and decisiveness while penalising hesitation.The first country to conclude a deal gets the most favourable terms, setting a baseline subsequent agreements must exceed. Each new deal, Lutnick said, moves ""up and to the right"", making later bargains more expensive or restrictive. ""The first stair gets the best,"" Lutnick explained. ""After that, everyone says, 'I want the UK deal.' And the answer is no - they were first.""UK, he said, moved quickly. Lutnick recalled telling British officials they had ""two Fridays"" to finalise the agreement. PM Keir Starmer, he said, personally called Trump as the deadline approached, and the deal was announced within days.India was given what Lutnick described as three Fridays - a ""shot clock (countdown timer)"". In that window, Trump signalled India could be next, a message Lutnick said was mea-nt to encourage urgency. ""I said, you've got to have Modi call the president,"" Lutnick recounted. ""They were uncomfortable doing so. Modi didn't call.""As the deadline passed, the administration moved on. Over the following weeks, Washington announced a series of trade deals across Asia, including with Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Those, Lutnick said, were negotiated at higher tariff and market-access levels than what India was offered, because the staircase had moved upward.When Indian officials later returned to the table, Lutnick said, they were seeking terms that no longer existed - effectively asking for a deal ""in between the UK and Vietnam"", which would have between 15% and 20% tariff. ""They said, 'But you agreed',"" Lutnick recalled. ""And I said, 'Then - not now'.""Lutnick framed India's predicament through an extended metaphor drawn from his early career as a trader, likening it to being stuck on the wrong side of a seesaw - a position where every move seems to make matters worse.Despite the sharp tone, Lutnick suggested the breakdown was not the result of hostility but of misaligned timing and domestic political constraints. He acknowledged trade negotiations are ""deeply complex"", often requiring parliamentary approval and consensus-building that can slow decision-making. Still, he emphasised that the Trump administration had little patience for delay. ""There are a lot of countries,"" Lutnick said, ""and each has its own deep internal politics. But the train doesn't wait.""The episode underscores a shift in US trade policy under Trump, one that prioritises leverage, speed and visible wins over protracted negotiations. Lutnick portrayed the president as the ultimate ""closer"", with himself as ""table setter"". While Lutnick expressed confidence US and India would ""work it out"", his remarks make clear any future agreement would come on less favourable terms. Trump, too, has not expressed any overt hostility towards India, insisting that the PM is a ""great guy"" and a ""good friend"".(Inputs from New Delhi)",Us commerce secretary howard lutnick claimed on a podcast that the bilateral trade deal wasn't signed as pm modi didn't call president donald trump.

Amit Shah Outlines Foolproof NIDMS Mechanism To Counter Future Terror Attacks

NEW DELHI: Asserting that the Modi govt over the past six years has created a next-generation shield against terrorism , home minister Amit Shah on Friday virtually inaugurated the National IED Data Management System (NIDMS) - a repository of data on attacks involving improvised explosive devices (IED), designed to aid investigation of terror blasts, analyse patterns and evolve deterrent strategies.Highlighting that the single-click access platform will connect with other security databases, Shah said NIDMS will serve as a two-way window, enabling anti-terror agencies like NIA, anti-terrorism squads, central armed police forces (CAPFs) and the state police forces to upload data on any blast or IED incident occurring within their jurisdiction, while also diving into the existing database - chronicling all bomb explosions since 1999 - for better investigation of terrorist incidents, understanding patterns regarding the modus operandi and explosives used and formulating effective strategies to deal with future blasts.Addressing the inauguration event at the NSG garrison in Manesar near Gurugram through video conferencing, Shah said that the Modi govt has, over the last six years, done significant work on creating varied security databases - CCTNS, which connects the country's 17,741 police stations; ICJS-2 that assimilates data from 22,000 courts; e-prisons database with records of over 2.2 crore prisoners; e-prosecution database on 2 crore prosecutions; e-forensics with 31 lakh samples and NAFIS that onboards over 1.2 crore fingerprints; and now NIDMS.Shah said work is underway to ensure that these databases don't exist is silos but ""talk to one another"". ""With the help of artificial intelligence, NIDMS will connect with other data sources to create a strong security grid in the country,"" he said.The NIDMS inauguration event was attended by the Union home secretary and chiefs of Intelligence Bureau (IB), NSG, CAPFs and various state/UT police.","The national ied data management system (nidms) is a repository of data on attacks involving improvised explosive devices.

‘India Will Not Be Anybody’s Vassal’: French President Macron’s Remark During Jaishankar Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid a shift in global power dynamics, India will back a rules-based global order while forging partnerships and strategies to secure its national interest, a top govt official said Friday.Delivering the inaugural Bibek Debroy Memorial Lecture, principal secretary to PM Shaktikanta Das said that India is adapting to the new alignment and reiterated the need to revitalise the multilateral system.""Today we stand at an inflection point where shifting geopolitical winds and trade policies are reshaping the global economic order. Traditional multilateralism, once a cornerstone of global governance, is under severe strain. It is increasingly being sidelined by geopolitical rivalries, protectionism and fragmentation. Key international institutions are struggling to deliver on their mandates. Institutions, which were once the bedrock of rules-based system, are underperforming in their core mandates,"" he said while pointing to disruption in supply chains and trade tensions.Das, however, argued that India was well placed to deal with the challenges thanks to a series of reforms undertaken in the last few years.""India stands today at the cusp of a historic journey - from being an 'Incredible India' to a credible India. There will be headwinds and challenges emanating from known and unknown sources. In the recent past, India has successfully emerged out of what appeared to be perfect storms caused by multiple global shocks since the Covid-19. And now with policies that the country has adopted, the wind is in our sails,"" he said.The former RBI governor listed out a raft of reforms - from GST, and its recent revamp, to the insolvency law, labour codes and RERA - to argue that there was a fundamental shift in the economy, which was resulting in faster economic expansion. He also said that India had managed to successfully pull back from the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy post-Covid, unlike a delay in several countries.Das said govt's push for atmanirbharta or self-reliance will enable the country to be an architect of global growth. ""Atmanirbharta is not being isolationist, but a strategy to build core competence and resilience. Economic Atmanirbharta means developing the capacity to produce critical goods and technologies at home and reducing over-reliance on foreign sources.""Atmanirbharta has two complementary dimensions: economic self-reliance and geopolitical autonomy. A self-reliant economy, with strong domestic capabilities, gives us greater strength to sustain our economic growth; and an autonomous foreign policy enables us to deal with the external environment in our best national interest. Together, they ensure that India's rise is resilient, sustainable, and beneficial to us and to the world,"" he said.Envisioning India 10 years from now, Das spoke of a young workforce highly skilled in digital tools; seamless transactions and innovations on a world-class digital infrastructure; economic activity increasingly getting formalised; and Indian-led innovations in AI, health, and space driving productivity gains.","Principal secretary to the pm, shaktikanta das, said govt’s push for atmanirbharta or self-reliance would enable the country to be an architect of global growth.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan.

Gold February futures on MCX are trading near ₹1,37,800 after a sharp pullback from higher levels. The recent recovery attempt appears corrective in nature, with price facing strong resistance near the previous breakdown zone. Technical indicators suggest that upside momentum is losing steam, making higher levels vulnerable to fresh selling pressure. The intraday setup favors a sell-on-rise approach in the ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000 range.Prices are trading below the short-term EMA cluster, with EMA 8 failing to sustain above EMA 21. This indicates weak short-term structure and suggests that rallies are likely to be sold into rather than extended.Gold has moved back toward the mid-Bollinger band after testing lower levels, but the upper band near ₹1,38,000 continues to act as a firm resistance. This positioning supports the view of capped upside in the near term.• Resistance Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Support Levels: ₹1,36,800 followed by ₹1,36,400Failure to sustain above pivot resistance keeps the intraday bias tilted to the downside.RSI is around 60, indicating a short-term recovery but not strong enough to confirm trend reversal. This level often precedes consolidation or pullback when price approaches resistance.MACD has shown a brief positive crossover, but histogram bars are flattening, signaling waning bullish momentum. This increases the probability of a rollover from higher levels.The recovery has been accompanied by moderate volume, while open interest remains soft, hinting that the move lacks strong long buildup and is prone to reversal.• Strategy: Sell on rise• Sell Zone: ₹1,37,800 – ₹1,38,000• Stop-Loss: ₹1,39,100• Downside Target: ₹1,36,400• Bias: Bearish below ₹1,38,000; strength only above ₹1,39,100.Gold’s intraday technical structure remains vulnerable as prices trade below key moving averages and momentum indicators fail to confirm sustained strength. The resistance band near ₹1,38,000 is likely to attract selling pressure. Traders are advised to sell on rise around ₹1,37,800–₹1,38,000, keep a strict stop-loss at ₹1,39,100, and look for a move toward ₹1,36,400 during the session.","Gold price rally appears to be losing steam for now, says jateen trivedi, vp research analyst - commodity and currency, lkp securities.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in india to temporarily suspend visa services.
