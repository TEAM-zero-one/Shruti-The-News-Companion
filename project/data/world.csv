NEW DELHI: United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday arrived in Mumbai for a two-day visit to India.Starmer landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. He will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday at Raj Bhavan, Mumbai, and attend the CEO Forum and Global Fintech Fest 2025 at the Jio World Centre.Starmer was received by Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, deputy CMs Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, and Maharashtra governor Acharya Devvrat.The visit will include high-level discussions to strengthen the India–UK Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and review the Vision 2035 Roadmap for bilateral cooperation.PM Starmer visted India at the invitation of PM Modi, the ministry of external affairs said on Saturday. This will be his first official visit to the country.The two Prime Ministers will also discuss opportunities presented by the India–UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and exchange views on regional and global issues, including trade, technology, defence and climate initiatives.Starmer’s two-day visit has a strong trade focus, with the Scotch whisky industry expected to be one of the “big winners” of the India–UK Free Trade Agreement.Downing Street said members of the Scotch Whisky Association are part of Starmer’s trade mission to explore a potential increase in whisky sales to India worth an estimated £1 billion a year, creating over 1,000 new UK jobs.Starmer’s engagements in India will include key meetings with senior ministers and business leaders to deepen bilateral trade and diplomatic ties.“The historic trade deal the UK government struck with India this year is great news for Scotland and especially our whisky industry; but having secured the deal, our challenge and responsibility now is to put this deal into action,” said Douglas Alexander, UK secretary of state for Scotland.Alexander added that Starmer would “beating the drum for Scotland’s finest products,” emphasising that the FTA would allow British exports to reach new markets.The UK government has called the CETA a “landmark” agreement that will boost growth across the country, with export opportunities for other Scottish products such as shortbread and Irn Bru.Business and trade secretary Peter Kyle and investment minister Lord Jason Stockwood are among the ministers accompanying Starmer on the trip, which will focus on implementing the agreement.British government estimates indicate that the CETA could increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, lift UK GDP by £4.8 billion, and raise wages by £2.2 billion annually in the long term.","Uk prime minister keir starmer arrives in mumbai for a two-day visit to india.

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1, 2025.“Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on October 1, but the timeline was pushed back. The new announcement marks the latest step in his broader tariff agenda aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.As per Bloomberg, the 25% duties are part of Trump’s expanding trade measures designed to “protect domestic industries.” The decision follows a probe launched in April by the US commerce department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose import taxes on goods considered vital to national security.The investigation focused on medium- and heavy-duty trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds and their components, noting that a “small number” of foreign suppliers dominate the market due to “predatory trade practices.”Last month, Trump introduced a series of tariff announcements — including 100% on pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture — set to begin in October.At the time, he said the 25% tariff on heavy trucks would safeguard major American truck manufacturers such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner and Mack Trucks.“In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing a 25% Tariff,” Trump wrote then, describing the move as essential to keeping the nation’s truckers “financially healthy and strong” for “national security purposes”.Trump has defended his protectionist measures as a strategy to promote domestic production, despite criticism that higher import duties could increase costs for consumers and businesses.","Us president donald trump on monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the united states.

I use tariffs to stop wars. If you look at India and Pakistan, They were ready to go at it. Seven plays were shot down. They were ready to go at it. And then nuclear powers.

The strike, carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists in Pahalgam, killed 26 people.In response, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, with the Indian Air Force (IAF) targeting nine major terror hubs inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Pakistan attempted to retaliate with drones and missile strikes, but Indian air defence systems successfully intercepted all incoming threats. As tensions rose, the IAF carried out precision strikes on 11 Pakistani airbases, including strategic sites such as Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.While there were no casualties or structural damage reported in India, the Indian military released visual proof of the damage caused by its cross-border strikes.The IAF’s strong air defence capabilities played a crucial role in safeguarding Indian airspace during the exchange, neutralising multiple UAV and drone threats.","Us president donald trump repeated the claim that he solved the conflict between nuclear-armed india and pakistan earlier this year with the help of tariffs.

NEW DELHI: Ukrainian media reported Tuesday that a 22-year-old Indian national who was fighting for the Russian army had been captured by Ukrainian forces. Indian authorities did not confirm the detention but said they were working to verify reports that identified the man as Majoti Sahil Mohammed, apparently a resident of Morbi in Gujarat.Government sources said that the Indian mission in Kyiv had not received any formal communication on this issue from Ukraine.According to one of the reports from Kyiv, Mohammed had gone to Russia to study but was forced to join the Russian armed forces after a drug conviction. It quoted him as saying he did not want to fight and had surrendered before Ukrainian forces.Confirming last month that there were 27 Indian nationals still serving in the Russian army , the Indian foreign ministry had urged Indian nationals to stay away from the offers being made to serve in the Russian army as they were fraught with danger and risk to life.Majoti appeared on a video recorded by Ukraine's 63rd Mechanised Brigade, saying that he was sentenced to seven years in a Russian prison on drug-related charges. He was offered the opportunity to sign a contract with the Russian military to avoid further punishment, said the Kyiv Independent.Ukrainian authorities quoted him as saying he did not want to fight, needed help and also didn't want to go back to Russia as ""there is no truth there"".

On this day twenty-five years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took oath as the chief minister of Gujarat — a moment that would shape not just his political journey but also the trajectory of the Bharatiya Janata Party Under his leadership, the BJP has grown exponentially, expanding its footprint across states and consolidating its influence at the Centre.As he completes a 25 years in public service, here’s looking at his major milestonesAlso read: 'On this day ...': PM Modi shares nostalgic pictures on day he first became Gujarat CM Appointed Gujarat’s chief minister in 2001 to replace Keshubhai Patel, PM Modi took charge amid post-earthquake challenges and political instability. He led the BJP to three consecutive assembly wins — in 2002, 2007, and 2012 — becoming the state’s longest-serving CM. His governance style in the state came to be known as the “Gujarat Model”.2014 was a watershed moment. He led the BJP to its first solo majority in three decades, ending the coalition era and reducing Congress to 44 seats. This victory marked the end of coalition politics and established the BJP as a dominant force. Congress experienced its worst-ever performance. As a result, there was no official leader of the opposition in the 16th Lok Sabha, as a party needed at least 10% of the seats (55 seats) to qualify.Surpassing predecessors like Dr. Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PM Modi now ranks as the third longest-serving Prime Minister of the country. This feat makes him the first non-Congress leader to achieve such a long and consequential tenure, a period exceeded only by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.Under PM Modi's leadership, the BJP delivered two stunning electoral performances. In 2014 and 2019, the BJP won 282 and 303 Lok Sabha seats respectively — both clear majorities. Even in 2024, though the party fell short of a solo majority with 240 seats, the NDA coalition retained power with the support of Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu.PM Modi's approval ratings consistently rank among the highest for global democratic leaders. According to global intelligence firm Morning Consult, Prime Minister Modi's domestic approval rating consistently hovers around 75%. His approval rating is over 30 points higher than that of the US President Donald Trump.The BJP’s geographical growth under his tenure has been transformative. When he took office nationally in 2014, the NDA governed seven states. By mid-2024, the coalition had successfully expanded its rule to more than 18 states. The party’s presence deepened in regions once seen as out of bounds, from the Northeast to southern India.Leveraging digital platforms for immediate communication, PM Modi is one of the most followed world leaders, commanding over 108 million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter. His adept use of social media has created a direct communication channel with citizens, bypassing traditional media filters.The party’s parliamentary strength has grown dramatically, increasing from 161 Lok Sabha and 49 Rajya Sabha seats in 2013 to a current strength of 240 and 102, respectively. Furthermore, the Congress's failure to secure the required 10% seats meant the leader of opposition post remained vacant for two consecutive terms (2014 and 2019).Illustrating the surge in popular support, the BJP’s national vote share saw a 12-point jump, rising sharply from 18.8% in 2009 to 31% in 2014. It peaked in 2019 to 37.36% before a marginal dip in 2024, when the NDA still formed the government.Under his leadership, India’s economic scale has achieved a significant milestone, more than doubling its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in under ten years. India has gone from being the 10th largest in 2014 to 4th largest in 11 years under the Modi government. India is now the 4th largest economy in the world, in nominal GDP terms, overtaking Japan, and is behind only the US, China, and Germany. According to the IMF, India’s GDP currently stands at $4.3 trillion.","Pm modi marks 25 years of public service. 4,078 days as pm: modi tops indira gandhi, now behind jawaharlal nehru in india's longest pm streaks.longest-serving chief minister of gujarat in 2001.

Shoe hurled at CJI: Attacker says acted on God's will; Gavai's mother issues 'anarchy' warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/attack-on-sc-attacker-says-acted-on-gods-will-gavais-mother-issues-anarchy-warning/articleshow/124365090.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court advocate Rakesh Kishore who allegedly attempted to throw a shoe at Chief Justice of India (CJI) B R Gavai during court proceedings on Monday, has claimed that he acted under divine direction.Speaking after a day after the incident, the 71-year-old advocate said, “The Almighty made it happen, I only did what happened; I had no role in it, I don’t do such things. I was just a witness; what happened, happened.”Kishore went on to add that his actions carried “a hidden message”, referring to remarks made by the CJI during a September 16 hearing. “On September 16, in the Supreme Court hearing of a PIL, CJI Gavai made fun of Sanatan Dharma by mocking the idol. I don’t know who filed that PIL or who the petitioner was, but at that time he joked about the idol,” Kishore told news agency IANS.Responding to the incident, CJI Gavai’s mother, Dr Kamal Gavai, condemned the attempt and warned that such actions could destabilise the country. “I condemn the shoe thrown at CJI. The Indian Constitution gives equal rights to all, but some people, taking the law into their own hands, behave in a manner that is disrespectful to India and can spread anarchy in the country.No one in this country has the right to do this,” she said. Urging restraint, she added, “I would request everyone that whatever questions you have, whatever you want to say, please raise them peacefully.”The dramatic courtroom incident unfolded as a bench led by CJI Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran was hearing the mentioning of cases. Kishore, a resident of Mayur Vihar, reportedly approached the dais, removed his shoe and attempted to throw it towards the judges before being swiftly restrained by security personnel. The CJI remained calm throughout and continued the proceedings, instructing the court staff to “ignore it” and let the lawyer off with a warning.The Bar Council of India has since suspended his licence pending investigation, while police are probing the motive behind the act.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called the CJI to express his condemnation, saying the attack “has angered every Indian” and praising Justice Gavai’s composure. “It highlights his commitment to values of justice and strengthening the spirit of our Constitution,” PM Modi said.",Supreme court advocate rakesh kishore claims he acted under divine direction.

NEW DELHI: India, along with other nations, on Tuesday, opposed the deployment of foreign military infrastructure on Afghan soil, effectively rejecting United States president Donald Trump's calls for handing over the Bagram airbase.The joint opposition came at the 7th Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, which included India, Afghanistan, Russia and China, Iran and Central Asian countries, including Pakistan.The countries described the presence of a foreign military in Afghanistan as ""unacceptable"" during the extensive deliberation on bringing prosperity and development to Afghanistan.“They called unacceptable the attempts by countries to deploy their military infrastructure in Afghanistan and neighbouring states, since this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability,” said a joint statement published by the Russian foreign ministry.The Indian delegation, led by Ambassador Vinay Kumar, reaffirmed India’s support for an independent, peaceful, and stable Afghanistan, along with the socioeconomic development and prosperity of its people, according to the Indian Embassy in Moscow.US president Donald Trump issued a warning to Afghanistan last month, demanding the return of Bagram Air Base to Washington or face consequences.“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, bad things are going to happen,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.The ultimatum follows remarks made earlier in the week during Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, where he revealed Washington was “trying to get it back.” Standing beside British prime minister Keir Starmer, he said, “We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us.”The issue underscores the base’s strategic significance. Its location gives access to volatile parts of Central and South Asia, while also offering a vantage point close to China’s sensitive Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear missile sites.Trump also complained that the United States had “gave it to them for nothing,” adding that Bagram is “exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.”Bagram Air Base, located in Afghanistan’s Parwan province, was a key strategic hub for the United States since the 2001 invasion. However, following the US withdrawal in 2021 and the Taliban ’s rapid re-invasion, the United States lost control of Bagram.Also read: What is the ‘insurrection act’?

NEW DELHI: India firmly supports a free, fair, inclusive and participatory national election in Bangladesh at the earliest possible time, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Monday while noting that matters related former PM Sheikh Hasina are “judicial and legal” in nature and requires “consultations” between the two neighbours.In December last year, Bangladesh sent a note verbale to India requesting the extradition of Hasina, who fled on Aug 5 amid massive protests against her Awami League government.“We are examining these issues. We look forward to working together with Bangladesh authorities on these issues,” he said while responding to a question during an interaction with members of the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh, here.Recently, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus had slammed India for “backing” Hasina, saying ties are strained because New Delhi didn’t like last year’s developments. “They are hosting Hasina who created all the problems and killed young people (to quell protests),” he said.On whether the events of last year — which led to a decline in India-Bangladesh ties — hindered “engagements” with the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, Misri said, “That hasn’t prevented us from working with or engaging authorities.”Asked about reports of New Delhi trying to reinstate Hasina — being tried in absentia for “crimes against humanity” back home — and her banned party, Misri said India is only in favour of an early election in Bangladesh for an opportunity for people to express their mandate to the popularly elected govt. “We remain ready to engage with any government that emerges from this election with a popular mandate,” he said.Though Misri acknowledged there are “some issues” in the India-Bangladesh relationship, he said it is rooted in strong cultural, linguistic, religious and historical ties, and is “time-tested”. He said India’s approach towards Bangladesh has always been pragmatic.Referring to the Feb timeframe to hold the poll, Misri said the next steps in Bangladesh’s internal political process will be closely watched regionally and globally.On Dhaka’s stake in regional peace, progress and stability, he expressed confidence that Bangladesh recognises its importance. He denied commenting on the uptick in ties between Dhaka and Islamabad.","Hasina issue needs consultations, says vikram misri.

These things do not affect me.”Kishore was swiftly restrained by security personnel as he shouted, “Sanatan ka apman nahi sahenge” (“We will not tolerate insults to Sanatan Dharma”).later in the day ,the Bar Council of India on Monday suspended advocate Rakesh Kishore from practising in any court with immediate effect, after he allegedly attempted to hurl a shoe at Chief Justice of India B R Gavai during proceedings in the Supreme Court.CJI Gavai had, during the hearing of the Lord Vishnu idol matter, remarked that the petitioner seeking directions to restore the idol should go and seek the remedy by praying to Lord Vishnu, as the Court declined to entertain the same.While refusing to hear the case, the top court opined that it's a dispute over a temple, which is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), suggesting that the ASI is a better authority to intervene in this regard.As his remarks sparked reactions on social media, CJI Gavai clarified that he respects all religions.The comments came during the post-lunch session of the CJI-led bench at the Supreme Court.The Solicitor General of India (SGI), Tushar Mehta, who was also present in the court, stated that he has known the CJI for the last ten years and is aware that the CJI visits all religious places.

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness. ""These unclaimed amounts are not government property but belong to individuals and families,"" Sitharaman said. ""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister nirmala sitharaman saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

Shedeur Sanders on Joe Flacco: mentor, teammate, and friend



What’s next for Sanders and Flacco



Shortly after Cleveland Browns benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco for rookie Dillon Gabriel, the team moved quickly, trading the 40-year-old quarterback to the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday. Flacco started four games this season, but after a 1–3 start, the Browns opted to give their third-round pick a chance. The trade not only reshaped Cleveland’s quarterback room but also elevated fifth-round rookie Shedeur Sanders to the backup position.Shedeur Sanders, who had been listed as the third-string quarterback, will now serve as Dillon Gabriel’s backup. The rookie spoke candidly about Flacco’s impact, telling John Sabol of Fox 8 News, “Dang, that happened quick.” Despite the sudden move, Sanders expressed admiration for Flacco’s guidance.“He’s definitely somebody I leaned on for wisdom, and I feel like he helped me a lot,” Sanders said. “He helped a lot while my time being here in Cleveland and his time being here in Cleveland. Everybody has their own destinies and has their own plans in life, so I’m just happy for him.”Even though Flacco never considered himself a formal mentor, his presence proved supportive.Sanders recalled Flacco offering encouragement after a challenging final preseason outing. “He’s definitely a person that adjusts to any situation he’s in,” Sanders added. “He’s an old man, so it’s funny though. … I always bring the youngness out of him, and he always smiles at the funny things I do.”The trade, though surprising, reinforced the bond between the veteran and the rookie. Sanders’ reaction shows the respect and friendship that grew during their time together, highlighting how mentorship in the NFL often comes from the locker room, not just the playbook.With Flacco heading to Cincinnati, he faces an immediate challenge: stepping in for the struggling Bengals offense, which has felt the absence of Joe Burrow. Flacco could replace Jake Browning as soon as this week, potentially rejuvenating a team that has struggled with passing efficiency.Meanwhile, Sanders will lean on the lessons he learned from Flacco as he embraces his new responsibilities with Cleveland. His positive outlook on Flacco’s future emphasizes maturity beyond his years. “Everybody has their own destinies and have their own plans in life. So, I’m just happy for him,” Sanders reiterated.As the NFL season continues, this trade illustrates more than a strategic move; it’s a moment of growth for a rookie and a fresh opportunity for a seasoned quarterback seeking a second wind.Also Read: Deshaun Watson flaunts luxury private jet date night with wife amid Browns quarterback drama","Cleveland browns traded veteran quarterback joe flacco to the cincinnati bengals on tuesday.

Stephen M. Lepore of The Daily Mail reported that President Donald Trump told NewsMax’s Greg Kelly Reports on Monday night that he was unfamiliar with Bad Bunny , the 31-year-old musician, and the NFL was wrong to give him the prestigious gig, given his previously stated dislike for Trump and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Trump said, “I never heard of him, I don’t know who he is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, it’s like crazy. ” Trump also remarked that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was blaming the decision “on some promoter they hired,” adding, “I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”Host Greg Kelly asked Donald Trump: “The NFL just chose the Bad Bunny rabbit or whatever his name. This guy, who hates ICE, he doesn’t like you; he accuses everything he doesn’t like of racism. Do you think maybe we should entertain an NFL boycott or something along those lines? This guy does not seem like a unifying entertainer and a lot of folks don’t even know who he is.”The 79-year-old President replied, “I never heard of him, I don’t know who he is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, it’s like, crazy. Then they blame it on some promoter that they hired to pick up entertainment, I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”Alex Young of Consequence reported that after sharing his views on Bad Bunny, Trump shifted to discuss the NFL’s new kickoff rule: “And while we’re at it, I’d like them to change the kick-off rule, which looks ridiculous. Where the ball is kicked, and the ball is floating, and everyone is standing there watching it. It’s not any safer than the regular kick-off. It looks so terrible. It really demeans football, to be honest with you. It’s a great game, but it demeans football. Do you know what I mean?”On September 30, Will Neal of NewsMax’s Daily Beast reported that rapper Bad Bunny would be performing in the Super Bowl next February, and uber-MAGA NewsMax host Greg Kelly was absolutely fuming. On last Monday's Greg Kelly Reports, the host explained his disagreement: “So you heard about this guy, da bunny? Is that his name? Bad Bunny? Bad, Bad, Bunny!
