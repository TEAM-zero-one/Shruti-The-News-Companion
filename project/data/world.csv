Here's the top 10 things to know:

DGCA issued an advisory on Monday asking airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions from the volcanic ash plume drifting from Ethiopia.

According to IndiaMetSky Weather the ash cloud entered Gujarat Monday evening before moving towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab. The service stated: ""Ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (West side) and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.""

The plume is travelling 100–120 km/h at altitudes between 15,000 and 45,000 feet, carrying ash, sulphur dioxide and microscopic glass and rock particles.

Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM have cancelled flights, with routes to the Middle East and Europe particularly affected. Akasa Air said: ""Following recent volcanic activity in Ethiopia and the resulting ash plume in the surrounding airspace, our flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for 24th and 25th November 2025 have been cancelled.""

DGCA instructed airlines to avoid ash-affected airspace, revise flight planning and immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine anomalies or cabin smoke/odour.

Airports have been told to inspect runways, taxiways and aprons and restrict operations until cleaning is completed if ash contamination is detected.

Mumbai airport warned passengers: ""A volcanic eruption in Ethiopia has affected airspace over parts of West Asia, which may impact some international routes.""

Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.

The explosive eruption, which began around 8:30 am UTC [1.30 pm IST] on Sunday, marks the first activity from the nearly 10,000-year-dormant volcano.

After the eruption, volcanic ash activity has been reported over parts of the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in airlines issuing cautionary notices for passengers flying through the Middle East, though no advisories have mentioned ash drift toward India.

NEW DELHI: Airline operations across parts of the country faced disruptions after volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi eruption drifted toward western and northern regions, prompting the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday to issue a detailed advisory.The ash plume, travelling at high altitudes and significant speed, entered Gujarat and moved eastward through Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.With the cloud containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and fine glass particles, airlines have begun cancelling and diverting flights to avoid the dangerous plume.Airports have also been asked to remain vigilant and inspect surfaces for ash contamination that could affect aircraft engines and airfield operations.Multiple carriers, including IndiGo, Akasa Air, and KLM, have already modified schedules, while authorities continue monitoring the cloud’s trajectory. Disruptions are expected to evolve as the plume moves across northern India.IndiGo's Kannur-Abu Dhabi flight (6E 1433) diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday to avoid the affected corridor, while another Indian carrier operating into Abu Dhabi conducted extensive engine checks before beginning its return journey, reported news agency ANI.","Ash cloud from ethiopia's volcano expected to reach north india by 10 pm.

Airline issue warnings



NEW DELHI: An ash cloud from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcano hit parts of India Monday evening, according to IndiaMetSky Weather. The plumes first entered Gujarat from the west and then moved rapidly toward Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by around 10 pm, and is drifting towards the Himalayas and other northern regions.Authorities watched the plume’s movement towards Delhi and Jaipur, with early signs spotted near Jamnagar around 5.30 pm, leading to disruptions as the situation developed.The ash plume is travelling at altitudes between 15,000-25,000 feet, rising up to 45,000 feet in some layers, and carries volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and tiny particles of glass and rock.IndiaMetSky Weather warned that skies could appear ""darker and hazier than usual"" and said that the plume may disrupt air traffic and lead to ""delays and longer travel.""The Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said the explosive eruption began around 8:30 am GMT on Sunday, marking the first activity from the almost 10,000-year-dormant Hayli Gubbi volcano.Thick columns of ash rose up to 14 kilometres into the sky from the Afar region, located around 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border.The VAAC confirmed that while the eruption had stopped, ""a large ash plume is moving toward northern India.""The volcano sits within the geologically active Rift Valley, where two tectonic plates meet. After erupting, the ash swept across the Red Sea toward Yemen and Oman before drifting eastwards into India and northern Pakistan, according to VAAC and regional media outlets.The windborne ash cloud swept across vast stretches of northwest India on Monday night, passing over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR and Punjab. Visibility dipped in several pockets as the plume drifted eastward.IndiaMetSky Weather said, ""Ash clouds moving towards North India. A large ash plume can be seen stretching from #HayliGubbi Volcano region upto #Gujarat. The eruption has stopped ever since the eruption, but this Ash plume has been sent up into the atmosphere, which is moving at a speed of 100-120km/h toward North India.”It added that the plume, containing volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and ""small particles of glass/rock,"" would likely darken the skies and impact flight routes. ""The Ash cloud is about to enter #Gujarat (West side) and move towards #Rajasthan NW #Maharashtra, #Delhi, #Haryana and #Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions,"" the agency said.By late night, the sulphur dioxide–rich plume was already moving over Delhi, NCR, Haryana and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. IndiaMetSky Weather explained that although some pockets of ash could be seen over Rajasthan, chances of ashfall on the plains remained ""less.""Also read: 'Moving at a speed of 100-120km/h': Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts towards India — 10 things to know According to the meteorological service, the ash cloud’s altitude means that India’s surface-level AQI is not expected to deteriorate.It reiterated that the event was ""mostly safe"" and said it would ""not like to impact surface AQI levels as Ash clouds are in 25,000 to 45,000 feet above the surface.""The agency said the plume was stretching from the Oman–Arabian Sea region into northern and central India. ""Its will not impact AQI levels but it will impact So2 level at #Hills of #Nepal, #Himalayas and adjoining Terai belt of #UttarPradesh as some of the material will bump into the hills and later move into China,"" it posted on X.It clarified that the plume would drift over Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, but the impact on the ground would be limited to darker skies and hazier conditions.While a few particles might fall to the surface, IndiaMetSky described the likelihood as ""low.”The agency also noted that residents might notice skies resembling a dust storm, though without harmful concentrations of particulate matter at ground level. People were advised to wear masks as a precaution, but officials stressed that the event was occurring at ""middle levels of the atmosphere.""Following the ash drift, airlines issued cautionary notices for flights operating through Middle Eastern airspace. In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released an advisory on Monday instructing airlines and airports to prepare for possible disruptions.It directed carriers to avoid volcanic-ash-affected routes and adjust flight plans, routing and fuel loads based on the latest advisories. The DGCA also said airports must immediately inspect runways, taxiways and aprons if ash contamination is suspected and restrict operations until cleaning is completed.Several carriers, including Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM, cancelled flights on Monday. Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport also alerted passengers that volcanic activity in Ethiopia had affected West Asian airspace and may impact some international routes, advising travellers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.","Ethiopia's hayli gubbi volcano erupts for first time after 10,000 years.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",'they said arunachal is china': indian woman alleges harassment after passport rejection in shanghai airport.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Monday criticised Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi for not attending the oath-taking ceremony of Justice Surya Kant as the 53rd Chief Justice of India , alleging his absence reflected “disrespect” towards B R Ambedkar and the Constitution.BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress leader of “skipping and boycotting” a key constitutional event attended by the country’s top leadership.Poonawalla, addressing reporters, said, “Today, when the entire country was in a sense celebrating, particularly Haryana, the Chief Justice of India's oath ceremony and the entire government led by Modiji was present at the event, he skipped it, boycotted it.”He further remarked, “Instead of attending this solemn programme, Rahul Gandhi may be on some foreign trip or jungle safari.”Justice Surya Kant, known for being part of landmark benches including the rulings on the abrogation of Article 370 and the revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls, was administered the oath by President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan.Vice President C P Radhakrishnan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several senior dignitaries were present.Justice Kant, who succeeds Justice B R Gavai, will serve until February 9, 2027.The BJP leader alleged that Gandhi and his party places “parivaar tantra” above democratic and constitutional norms, adding, “It shows that his family, particularly him, talk about 'samvidhan', but they don't respect Ambedkar and 'samvidhan'.”Justice Kant took the oath in Hindi in the name of God and will now head the Supreme Court for nearly 15 months.","Bjp national spokesperson shehzad poonawalla accused the congress leader of “skipping and boycotting” a key constitutional event attended by the country’s top leadership.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units.

Need to strengthen free speech: CJI Surya Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-strengthen-free-speech-cji-surya-kant/articleshow/125551207.cms,"Justice Surya Kant takes oath as CJI

Justice Surya Kant, Known For Article 370 Ruling And Pegasus Scrutiny, Takes Oath As India’s New CJI

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Surya Kant said on Monday that right to freedom of speech and expression ""is doubtless one of our most valued rights"" requiring further strengthening but emphasised the need for a framework that ""ensures responsibility, accuracy and respect in public discourses"".Speaking to TOI after taking oath as the 53rd CJI, the first from Haryana, Justice Kant said, ""It is not freedom of speech that causes harm to the dignity or reputation, it is the misuse of that freedom and the inefficiency of our remedies that causes it.""Importantly, his predecessor, ex-CJI B R Gavai also shared the view. ""Right to free speech is always subject to reasonable restrictions specified in the Constitution. If a person's speech is in violation of those reasonable restrictions, it falls foul of the fundamental right,"" Gavai said.Asked whether the existing mechanism provides for adequate remedies against abusive or hate speeches, the outgoing CJI said, ""I feel there should be a regulatory mechanism that needs to be put in place regarding this. It is for Parliament to take a decision on this issue.""CJI Kant said the right to free speech comes with an equally important obligation - exercise in a manner that aligns with a citizen's fundamental duties.""The Constitution envisions not just a free society, but a respectful and harmonious one. When we forget that duties are intrinsic to rights, we distort the balance that keeps democracy functional and we risk making the Constitution unworkable,"" he said.To a question whether distortions in social media through selective reporting is a deterrence for judges from posing probing questions or criticising actions of litigants, CJI Kant said such incidents, which have proliferated in the past few years, ""makes us more cautious in expression, but it must not deter us from asking probing questions necessary for delivering justice"". On Saturday, he had told the media that he does not get pressured by social media.Asked whether the rich, influential and powerful, represented by renowned senior advocates, get more time from Supreme Court compared to common litigants, the CJI said, ""The guiding principle of all courts in the country, including SC, is that the justice system must be equal for all regardless of status, profession, or representation.""""Cases are taken up based on objective criteria such as urgency, nature of rights involved and the stage of proceedings. Individual stature or resources cannot, do not, and shall never determine priority or even time allotted to such cases,"" he said.He said it is a myth that senior and renowned advocates get a better audience in courts.

SC to hear plea to end income tax exemption for political parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-to-hear-plea-to-end-income-tax-exemption-for-political-parties/articleshow/125550275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear a plea to do away with the exemption granted to political parties under Income Tax law and to restrain the parties from receiving donations in cash.The court sought responses from Centre and Election Commission on the plea which challenged the validity of a provision of the Income Tax Act that allows political parties to receive ""anonymous"" cash donations below Rs 2,000.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta also issued notice to all recognised political parties and sought their response on the PIL.According to section 13A, the income of a political party from the following sources is exempt from tax: income from house property, income from other sources, capital gains and income by way of voluntary contributions the party receives from any individual.The petition, filed through advocate Jayesh K Unnikrishnan, said that clause (d) of section 13A of Income Tax Act is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, and political parties must disclose the names and all other particulars of persons donating any sum of money and no amount must be received in cash so as to maintain transparency in political funding.""The clause allows political parties to receive anonymous cash donations below Rs 2,000.This lack of transparency deprives voters of crucial knowledge about the source of political funding, including the donors and their motives, preventing them from making a rational, intelligent and fully informed decision when casting their vote. Ultimately, this undermines the purity of the election process and compromises the integrity and accountability of a healthy democracy by allowing the potential influence of undisclosed or tainted money,"" the petition said.It said political parties are central entities in a democratic form of govt, and they must function in a transparent manner, with there being special reason for financial transparency to avoid unlawful influences of money power in the policymaking of the political party in govt. Receipt of huge amounts by political parties through purported donations from undisclosed sources is a breach of the public trust doctrine, it said.The bench was initially reluctant to entertain the PIL and suggested that the petitioner move the high court but agreed to examine it after senior advocate Vijay Hansaria stressed that the issue had pan-India implications and involved all recognised political parties.","The court sought responses from centre and election commission on the plea.

Indian Army Chief Reveals How A Trusted Orchestra Crushed Nine Targets in Operation Sindoor Blitz

NEW DELHI: In a move that will assuage veterans of Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka in the late-1980s, the Army chief will pay homage at National War Memorial on Tuesday to honour the sacrifice of Param Vir Chakra awardee Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran and other soldiers during Operation Pawan.This will be the first official memorial in India of this scale for military personnel who laid down their lives during the operation. NWM doesn't have any plaque recognising the sacrifice of the army during the tough operation.Gen Upendra Dwivedi and vice chief Lt Gen Pushpendra Singh will lay wreaths at NWM to honour the 1,171 Indian soldiers who died - another 3,500 were wounded - during Operation Pawan.It was India's first large-scale overseas military operation that began in October 1987 to bring peace by disarming Tamil militant groups like LTTE, but ended on a bitter note with the Sri Lankan govt demanding IPKF's withdrawal in early-1990.IPKF veterans have for a long time been demanding official designation of a day to remember Operation Pawan on the lines of commemoration of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1999 Kargil conflict. IPKF received numerous gallantry medals - which included the PVC for Maj Parameswaran, who died on Nov 25 in 1987 - and 98 Vir Chakras.""While Sri Lanka built a memorial for IPKF in Colombo, there has been no formal day of commemoration in India so far to honour those soldiers.A group of IPKF veterans, widows and families quietly gather at the NWM every year to pay homage, but they are essentially private ceremonies,"" an IPKF veteran said.Army vice chief Lt-Gen Singh, who was commissioned into 4 Para-Special Forces in Dec 1987, incidentally was seriously injured as a young second-lieutenant in a firefight between his unit deployed under IPKF and LTTE in July 1989.""The gesture reflects the Army's collective respect for the bravehearts and reinforces the enduring bond between serving personnel, veterans and families of the fallen, united in remembering those who gave their today for the nation's tomorrow,"" an officer said.",The army chief will pay homage at national war memorial on tuesday to honour the sacrifice of param vir chakra awardee major ramaswamy parameswaran and other soldiers during operation pawan.

NEW DELHI: An Indian was detained for nearly 18 hours by Chinese immigration authorities at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport on Nov 21, after officials allegedly refused to recognise her Indian passport because her birthplace was listed as Arunachal Pradesh.Pema Wang Thongdok, who was travelling from London to Japan with a transit stop in Shanghai, stated that immigration officers declared her passport ""invalid"", insisting that Arunachal Pradesh was ""part of China"" and therefore could not appear as a birthplace on an Indian document.In a series of posts on X, Thongdok said officials seized her passport, blocked her from boarding her onward flight despite holding a valid Japanese visa, denied her access to food and other basic facilities, and repeatedly mocked her, telling her she should apply for a Chinese passport. She alleged China Eastern Airlines staff also forced her to buy a fresh ticket before returning her passport. Thongdok said she contacted the Indian consulate in Shanghai through a friend in the UK, and consular intervention eventually allowed her to exit the airport late that night and continue her journey.Calling the incident a direct affront to India's sovereignty, she urged that protections be put in place for citizens from Arunachal.India lodged a strong protest with China both here and in Beijing, saying that at a time when both sides were working on restoring normalcy in ties, such actions introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.The Indian consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally. ""It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,"" said a source.Govt sources also said that the actions of the Chinese authorities were in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation that establish basic rules for international air travel.In a social media post, Congress wrote: ""This kind of treatment cannot be tolerated with any Indian. The Modi govt should lodge a strong objection with China on this matter. Modi ji, this is the right time to show China your 'red eyes' and respond.""Earlier this year, China released a list of names for 27 places in Arunachal.

"India-EU summit: FTA, defence and connectivity among key outcomes, EU seeks Paris commitment",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-summit-fta-defence-and-connectivity-among-key-outcomes-eu-seeks-paris-commitment/articleshow/125548280.cms,"'Some Last-Mile Issues...': Piyush Goyal Remarks On Trade Pact With EU And US, India's Export Growth

Feeling the heat from an unpredictable Trump administration, EU and India have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late January that the 27-nation bloc believes will help set not just bilateral but also global agenda. These include not just the free trade agreement (FTA) under discussion but also a defence and security partnership and a determined effort to accelerate the IMEC connectivity project.These are expected to be among the key takeaways from a joint statement that will follow the summit. Both sides have not allowed the lack of a geopolitical alignment, most noticeably on Russia, to come in the way of trade negotiations in a sign of the political will at the highest level to carry the relationship to the next level.While a dozen chapters are yet to be closed, India and EU are confident they will be able to reach a deal in time for the summit that is tentatively scheduled for January 27. However, both sides need to address differences over critical issues related to steel, cars and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a carbon tax on certain goods. These 3 issues remain major sticking points in the FTA talks.If the summit does materialise on the same day, EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, will likely also be the chief guests at India’s Republic Day parade a day earlier.India has invited both to attend the annual celebrations. Before that summit though, the EU will observe with interest the outcomes of another summit that PM Narendra Modi will have with Russian President Vladimir Putin in December.Another contentious issue is the Paris Agreement, the international treaty for climate action, that both sides have joined but EU wants the same commitment as an essential element in the agreement. India, however, sees it as a sovereignty issue that should not be mixed with trade. Political intervention at the highest level will likely be required to break this deadlock.The FTA of course tops the list of expected deliverables from the planned January summit. Keeping in mind that both sides are at different stages of development and have different sensitivities, diplomatic sources said, the EU is looking for a balanced, commercially meaningful and living FTA agreement that will evolve over time, allowing both sides to engage on any difficult issue in the future.According to the EU, the economic case for an FTA with India, which can facilitate reliable trade relations along with stable and integrated supply chains, had always been there but it has now been reinforced by the geopolitical situation. The FTA will be tailored specifically to meet the needs of both sides and the EU, accepting an asymmetry in favour of India, is ready to liberalise five percentage points more trade than India does.While only 12 chapters have been closed so far, and a lot of difficult technical and political work is still required, the EU believes that’s not really a good indicator of progress in talks as 90-98 percent of work on most remaining chapters or issues, including agricultural and non-agricultural market access, has been completed. India and EU need to address each other’s concerns related to steel and cars respectively for a relevant agreement though. While the Indian government seeks greater clarity about its steel exports, the EU wants decent market access for its car sector for the agreement to be commercially meaningful.Carbon import tax levied by EU remains a contentious issue amidst reports that it could even act as a deal-breaker. According to the EU, both sides have their own internal laws and one can’t negotiate amendments to these through an FTA. Any politician doing that would be dead-on-arrival back home, said a source on condition of anonymity. However, both sides are looking at whether they can use a “living FTA” as a platform to facilitate the navigation of each other’s regulatory environment.Fortunately for the FTA, India’s purchase of Russian oil is not an issue in the ongoing talks. Creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, without discounting technology leakage threat, is expected to be a significant deliverable. Progress is also expected in efforts by the EU to advance, in the IMEC framework, the EU-Africa-India Digital Corridor through a submarine cable system connecting Europe to India via the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. This EU initiative, as the new strategic agenda says, will provide ultra- high-speed, secure, and diversified data connectivity resilient to disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of sabotage.","Eu and india have lined up ambitious outcomes for the summit in late january.

PM Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leaders' Meeting on G20 margins, stressing that UNSC reform is imperative, and said that there should be no room for double standards while fighting terrorism.PM Modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended also by Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.While all three countries have had their share of problems with the US under Trump, diplomatic sources played down suggestions that the meeting was a response to the Americans as they cited the fact that a substantive IBSA summit meeting took place on the margins of 2024 G20 summit too in Rio.The US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa because of alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners.PM Modi said global institutions do not reflect the realities of 21st century. ""None of us is a permanent member of UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent today's world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,"" he said.""Similarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,"" he added, calling for institutionalising the NSA-level meeting of the countries to strengthen security cooperation.Describing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit on African soil and marked the culmination of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were by IBSA members. This, he said, had resulted in several important initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform and sustainable growth. Modi emphasised IBSA is not just a group of three countries but an important platform connecting three continents, three major democratic nations and three major economies.""Highlighting technology's crucial role in ensuring human-centric development, the PM proposed establishing an 'IBSA Digital Innovation Alliance' to facilitate sharing of Digital Public Infrastructure like UPI, health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks and women-led tech initiatives among the countries,"" said an Indian readout, adding the PM also emphasised IBSA's potential to contribute to development of safe, trustworthy and human-centric AI norms. He invited IBSA leaders to the AI summit next year.""Appreciating IBSA Fund's work in supporting projects across 40 countries in sectors like education, health, women empowerment and solar energy, the PM proposed IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation,"" said the Indian government.",Pm modi joined the trilateral mechanism meet hosted by south african president cyril ramaphosa and attended also by brazil president luiz inacio lula da silva.

‘In memory of our brothers’: Russian Pilot's Heartfelt Note For Indian Tejas Pilot After Dubai Crash

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Namansh Syal of the Indian Air Force was honoured with a ‘Missing Man’ manoeuvre by the Russian Knights aerobatics team after he was killed in a Tejas fighter jet crash at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.After the crash of the Indian Tejas fighter jet, the Russian Knights released a video of their performance at the Dubai Airshow 2025, paying tribute to the pilot and honouring the lives lost.In the video, shared on Russian social media platform VK, the team described the crash as “impossible to describe” and said their final-day performance was dedicated to the “memory of the brothers who did not return from the last flight”.At the air show, members of the US F-16 team also reacted strongly to the tragedy. Their pilot, Captain Taylor Hiester, said he was shocked that the event continued despite the fatal accident. The US team, along with a few others, chose to cancel their performance out of respect for the Indian pilot, his colleagues and his family.“After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season.Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,” Hiester wrote as he headed back to the US.The Tejas aircraft was in the middle of an eight-minute aerobatic display when it suddenly lost altitude during what appeared to be a low-level manoeuvre. Visuals aired across several channels showed the jet diving toward the ground before erupting into flames, sending thick black smoke over Al Maktoum International Airport. Spectators, including families with children, watched in shock as emergency teams rushed to the scene.","Wing commander namansh syal of the indian air force was honoured with a ‘missing man’ manoeuvre by the russian knights aerobatics team.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing.""

I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own.

Better chance for MLB playing time and growth in new team environments

What Each Party Gains

The New York Yankees are heading into one of their most defining offseasons in years, with reports indicating they are prepared to commit $165 million to secure a major offensive upgrade. Whether that player is Cody Bellinger - capable of playing first base and designated hitter - or star outfielder Kyle Tucker, the move signals a decisive shift toward prioritizing veteran stability and postseason readiness. Such an investment reflects the Yankees’ determination to maximize their championship window immediately.Yet this anticipated signing has triggered a significant secondary storyline: the uncertain future of top prospects Jasson Dominguez and Spencer Jones. For years, the organization nurtured these two as potential franchise pillars.
