Poll Do you believe the missile strike on Kusum Healthcare's warehouse was a deliberate attack? No, it was accidental Yes, it was deliberate

What's the response of Indian and Russian government?



Kusum Healthcare’s presence in Ukraine



Conflict continues despite ceasefire talks

Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, a warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday in what the Ukrainian embassy in India described as a ""deliberate attack.""The Ukrainian embassy in India said on Saturday that a Russian missile had hit the warehouse of Kusum Healthcare , an Indian pharmaceutical company operating in Ukraine.""Today, a Russian missile struck the warehouse of Indian pharmaceutical company Kusum in Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian embassy said in a post on X.In the same post, the embassy added: ""While claiming 'special friendship' with India, Moscow deliberately targets Indian businesses -- destroying medicines meant for children and the elderly.""So far, no additional details have been shared about the damage or casualties from the strike.The Indian and Russian governments are yet to comment on the matter.Martin Harris, the UK's ambassador to Ukraine, also claimed that Russian strikes destroyed a ""major pharma's warehouse in Kyiv"". However, his post did not mention whether the warehouse belongs to Kusum and also said the attack was carried out by Russian drones and not a missile.The governments of India and Russia have not yet issued any statements regarding the incident.Meanwhile, Martin Harris, the British ambassador to Ukraine, also said that Russian strikes had destroyed a ""major pharma’s warehouse in Kyiv."" However, he did not specify whether the warehouse belonged to Kusum Healthcare. He also mentioned that the attack was carried out using Russian drones, not a missile.""This morning Russian drones completely destroyed a major pharmaceuticals warehouse in Kyiv, incinerating stocks of medicines needed by the elderly and children. Russia's campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians continues,"" Mr Martin said in a post on X.According to its official website, headquartered in Delhi, Kusum Healthcare operates in 29 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, Mali, and Tanzania.The company is among several Indian firms with a business presence in Ukraine, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both countries have continued to exchange strikes. Although they agreed last month to stop targeting each other’s energy facilities, each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.India has maintained that dialogue is the only path to peace and has not taken sides in the conflict, even while keeping good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow.In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would urge the presidents of both countries to seek a peaceful resolution, saying, ""I can sit with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell (Ukraine) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield.""Despite the ongoing conflict, India has continued to buy large quantities of oil from Russia, which has been available at discounted rates due to Western sanctions and reduced demand from Europe. Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier, with India importing 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia in February, down from 1.67 million bpd in January.","A warehouse belonging to an indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a russian missile in ukraine on saturday.

Congress says UPA deserves credit for Tahawwur Rana extradition; Shiv Sena hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/credit-war-over-tahawwur-rana-extradition-digvijaya-says-upa-deserves-credit-shaina-nc-hits-back/articleshow/120231431.cms,"NEW DELHI: A political war of words broke out on Saturday over the extradition of 26/11 Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana to India, with Congress leader Digvijaya Singh crediting the UPA government for laying the groundwork, and Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC slamming the remark as “appeasement politics.”Rana, 64, a Canadian citizen and native of Pakistan, was extradited to stand trial in India on 10 criminal charges stemming from his alleged role and accused of being a key conspirator in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that left over 170 dead.Speaking to ANI, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said, “Iski shuruwat Congress ne ki thi... isme koi shrey Modi ji ko nahi jata hai.” He asserted that the extradition was possible only because the Congress-led UPA government had ensured Rana was named in the investigation at the right time, leading to his arrest in the United States. “Tahawwur Rana was involved in the 26/11 attacks, and his extradition was possible only because UPA govt put his name in the investigation at the right time and he was arrested in the US. After completing 14 years of imprisonment, he was extradited to India,” Singh said.Reacting strongly, Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) leader Shaina NC said, “This is not the first time that Digvijaya Singh or the Congress Party have made controversial statements. But look at the track record of the Congress party. Digvijaya Singh tried to link this (26/11 terrorist attacks) to the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS).”Calling the extradition a “matter of pride for India,” she credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s diplomacy. “Since 2019, diplomatic ties that Prime Minister Modi has been persevering with the United States, we have had the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, who is the mastermind of 26/11. For all those people who lost their lives, they’re probably looking at the Congress Party and wondering about its vote bank, appeasement politics and its ideology,” she said.Earlier this week, former Union home minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also weighed in, accusing the Modi government of taking undue credit for the development. In a statement issued on April 10, he said: “In February 2025, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump stood at a press conference and tried to take credit for what was essentially the result of years of UPA-era groundwork. By February 17, Indian officials confirmed Rana's role in the 26/11 conspiracy, dating back to 2005, when he coordinated with LeT and ISI operatives. Finally, on April 8, 2025, US authorities handed Rana over to Indian officials. He arrived in New Delhi on April 10.”","Tahawwur rana, 64, a canadian citizen and native of pakistan, was extradited to stand trial in india on 10 criminal charges.

NEW DELHI: A junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian Army was killed in a gunfight with terrorists during an infiltration attempt and ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the Line of Control in Jammu’s Akhnoor sector on Friday night, officials said.The encounter took place in the Keri Bhattal area, where troops spotted a group of heavily armed terrorists moving near a stream in a forested zone. When challenged, the infiltrators opened fire, triggering a fierce exchange. A JCO sustained critical injuries in the clash and later succumbed. Reinforcements were immediately deployed, and a search operation is currently underway in the area.According to White Knight Corps, the deceased jawan was Subedar Kuldeep Chand of 9 PUNJAB.This marks another major ceasefire breach since India and Pakistan reaffirmed their commitment to the 2021 LoC ceasefire agreement.The encounter with terrorists comes just two days after brigade commander-level talks were held between the two sides in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, aimed at managing border tensions and preventing such incidents.Also read: Three terrorists killed in ongoing Kishtwar encounter Meanwhile, anti-terror operations continue elsewhere in Jammu and Kashmir, with three terrorists killed in Kishtwar district.The Army’s White Knight Corps shared that a joint “search and destroy” mission with Jammu and Kashmir Police was launched on April 9 in the Chhatru forest of Kishtwar based on intelligence inputs. One terrorist was killed in an initial firefight that evening.A follow-up update from the Corps stated: “In the ongoing operations at Chhatru, Kishtwar, despite bad and inclement weather, two more Pakistani terrorists have been eliminated. A large quantity of war-like stores including one AK and one M4 rifle have been recovered.”In a similar incident earlier this year, two Army personnel, including a captain, were killed and another injured when terrorists triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) in the same region on February 11.The Indian Army has formally raised a strong protest with the Pakistani side over repeated cross-border terror attempts and ceasefire violations.Just days before this latest encounter, on April 5, Border Security Force (BSF) personnel shot dead a Pakistani intruder along the International Border in the R S Pura sector, following which a flag meeting was held with the Pakistan Rangers.","A junior commissioned officer (jco) of the indian army was killed in a gunfight with terrorists during an infiltration attempt and ceasefire violation by pakistan.

"India, 62 countries agree to world's 1st global carbon tax in shipping industry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-61-countries-agree-to-worlds-1st-global-carbon-tax-in-shipping-industry/articleshow/120241845.cms,"NEW DELHI: India joined 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax by bringing commercial shipping under this mechanism to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions in the sector. Under the agreement, ship owners will need to use cleaner fuels or face fines beginning 2028.Shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions. Since the sector is not covered under the Paris Agreement, the legally binding deal on imposing a global carbon tax on shipping to tackle emissions marks a significant development towards the overall 'net-zero' goal.The countries agreed on the global framework after voting at the UN’s International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London late Friday. The agreement, reached after nearly 10 years of negotiations, aims to put a carbon price on shipping emissions. It is expected to help the sector decarbonise and encourage the use of cleaner technologies.The carbon pricing measures, set to be formally adopted in October, will become mandatory for large ocean-going ships of over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emits 85% of the total carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping.Under the agreed framework, if a ship continues to use conventional fuel in 2028 it would have to pay $100 to $380 per tonne of emission, depending on crossing the threshold of 'base' and 'direct compliance' targets. It is estimated that the carbon tax could generate up to $40 billion by 2030. The funds will be used exclusively to decarbonise the shipping industry.A total of 63 countries, including India, China, the EU, Norway, Singapore, South Africa and Japan, voted in favour of the agreement, while 16, including major oil-producing Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia and Venezuela, voted against it, and 25 countries, mostly the small island nations and Argentina, abstained. The US delegation was not present at the time of the voting, sticking to its principle of not engaging in negotiations.“Now, it is important to continue working together, engaging in dialogue and listening to one another, if we are to create the conditions for successful adoption,” said IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez while commending the spirit of cooperation and commitment demonstrated by the shipping nations.Many expert groups pointed out that the agreement is projected to deliver at best 10% absolute emissions reduction in the shipping sector by 2030, which is far short of the IMO’s own targets set in their 2023 revised strategy, calling for at least a 20% cut by 2030, with a stretch goal of 30%.","India joins 62 other countries in agreeing to the world’s first-ever global carbon tax.

"Inspired by Pakistan, US statutes, SC sets bill passage deadline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/inspired-by-pakistan-us-statutes-sc-sets-bill-passage-deadline/articleshow/120241788.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court drew inspiration from provisions in the constitutions of Pakistan and the US in specifying timelines for governors in giving assent, returning or referring to President the bills passed by state assemblies, and said time-limit breach is amenable to judicial scrutiny.The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, pronounced on April 8 but uploaded on SC's website Friday, justified its decision to give purposive meaning to the words 'as soon as possible' in the Constitution for governors or the President in taking decision on bills passed by assemblies or Parliament.Writing the judgment, Justice Pardiwala gave omnibus scrutiny powers to SC, and said, ""No exercise of power under the Constitution is beyond the ambit of its judicial review. Thus, we find no reason to exclude discharge of functions by governor or President under Articles 200 & 201 of the Constitution, respectively.""The first question that arose before SC was whether the court had jurisdiction to step beyond the written words of the Constitution to prescribe a time-limit for the governor. It did so by drawing inspiration, first from its own judgment in 2021 prescribing a three-month outer-limit for Speakers to adjudicate pleas seeking disqualification of MLAs under anti-defection law.The other inspiration came from constitutions of Pakistan and the US. Justice Pardiwala said, ""For instance, Article 75 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan or Article I, Section 7 of the US Constitution , where if no decision is taken within the stipulated time limit by President, then bills are deemed to have been assented to.""Article 75 of Pakistan's constitution provides a 10-day period for the President to either assent or return a bill to Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament). If the returned bill is re-passed with or without amendment, then the president is bound to give assent to it within 10 days, beyond which the bill is deemed to have received his assent. But the court was aware that ""unlike many countries across the globe wherein a provision for deemed assent upon the expiry of the specified time period has been made, there is no such provision in our Constitution"". At the same time, it mentioned that during Constituent Assembly debates, Dr B R Ambedkar had proposed a six-week time limit for governors on this issue and that both the Sarkaria and Punchhi commissions had favoured a time limit.Thus, in the case of TN, SC had to resort to its potent Article 142 powers to rule that the long-delayed 10 bills passed by the assembly, on which the governor had dilly-dallied for months, would be deemed to have got his assent, and declared that his decision to refer them to the President after their re-passing by the assembly is illegal. It said any decision on such referred bills by the President would also be void. Sans a time limit, governors could play spoilsport for democracy where an elected govt gets five years to implement policies and election promises, SC said. ""Not taking any action on bills for an unreasonable and prolonged period of time virtually vests the governor with the power of pocket veto and it can't be held to be permissible within our constitutional scheme,"" SC said.","The 415-page magnum opus of a judgment by justices j b pardiwala and r mahadevan, pronounced on april 8 but uploaded on sc's website friday.

Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.",Tahawwur hussain rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on mumbai.

Poll Do you support the Trump administration's goal of deporting 1 million immigrants within the first year? No, I oppose it. Yes, I support it.

As US President Donald Trump resumes his presidency, his administration is reportedly targeting an unprecedented immigration crackdown, with a goal of deporting up to 1 million immigrants within the first year, according to multiple federal officials familiar with internal planning.According to a report from The Washington Post, the figure, which far exceeds previous records, has become a frequent reference point in behind-the-scenes discussions, although the administration has yet to publicly detail how the numbers are being calculated. Under former President Barack Obama, annual deportations peaked at just over 400,000.Experts and former officials have cast doubt on the feasibility of the goal, citing significant legal, logistical, and financial hurdles. Most undocumented immigrants in the US have a legal right to court proceedings before removal, a process that often takes months or even years due to extensive backlogs in the immigration system.White House adviser Stephen Miller has reportedly been holding near-daily meetings with officials from the department of homeland security (DHS) and other agencies to push the plan forward. One avenue under consideration includes deporting some of the estimated 1.4 million immigrants who already have final removal orders but remain in the country because their home nations have refused to accept them.In a bid to work around that obstacle, the administration is negotiating with up to 30 countries to accept non-citizen deportees, often referred to as third-country removals . Officials confirmed that immigrants have already been deported to nations such as Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama — and in one recent instance, Rwanda, following negotiations.If fully implemented, this would be the largest deportation effort in US history. A DHS spokesperson said more than 117,000 deportations had been carried out by late March, combining arrests made by immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) inside the country and those made by customs and border protection (CBP) at entry points. The agency claims these figures do not include individuals who have voluntarily left the US.Still, immigration analysts say the numbers fall well short of the administration's 1 million target. Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the migration policy institute and former US immigration commissioner, said ICE is projected to deport around 212,000 people this fiscal year — fewer than the 271,000 removals last year, most of which followed illegal border crossings.Detentions are at capacity, with more than 47,000 individuals in custody in late March. Deportation flights are on the rise but only marginally — from about 100 in January to 134 in March, a 15 per cent increase. ""It would be just a massive, massive increase to reach 1 million removals,"" said Tom Cartwright, an advocate who tracks deportation data. ""I don't know where those numbers are coming from.""Meanwhile, the administration has reportedly leaned on high-profile operations, transferring detainees to facilities in El Salvador and Guantánamo Bay — moves viewed by insiders as more symbolic than impactful.A multi-agency push involving the FBI, DEA, and ATF is underway to locate and detain individuals with final deportation orders. Still, morale among immigration officers is reportedly flagging amid persistent pressure and skepticism about achieving the administration's goals.""They say it jokingly: 'We’ve got to get a million removals.' That's their goal,"" said one former official.On the legal front, the administration has encountered pushback. Federal judges have blocked attempts to deport immigrants without proper hearings, particularly in cases involving removal to third countries. In one instance, a Salvadoran man was mistakenly deported despite a court order protecting him due to threats from gangs in his home country.In response to growing legal scrutiny, DHS Secretary Kristi L Noem issued guidance mandating that before any third-country deportation, officers must secure ""diplomatic assurances"" ensuring the person will not face torture or persecution. Immigrants must be informed of their destination and allowed to raise objections. If fear is expressed, they must undergo a screening by US citizenship and immigration services, typically within 24 hours — a timeframe criticised by immigration lawyers as inadequate.While the Trump administration has refrained from publicly confirming the 1 million figure, spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that the government is acting on a mandate from voters to overhaul the immigration system. ""The entire Trump administration is aligned on delivering on this mandate, not on arbitrary goals,"" he said, framing the efforts as focused on removing ""terrorist and criminal illegal aliens.""Despite the rhetoric and ramped-up enforcement, analysts and former officials alike remain unconvinced the administration can hit its aspirational target. ""This isn't just a switch you can flip,"" Meissner said. ""The deportation process is complex and resource-intensive.""","Us president donald trump is reportedly targeting an unprecedented immigration crackdown. The administration has a goal of deporting up to 1 million immigrants within the first year. The figure has become a frequent reference point in behind-the-scenes discussions. Under former president barack obama, annual deportations peaked at just over 400,000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120246644,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1307991,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Nuclear talks: A new chance for US-Iran diplomacy? | DW News

How much is Iran willing to concede?



US President Donald Trump announced on Monday, April 7, 2025, that Washington and Tehran would begin talks over Iran's nuclear programme in Oman. Oman has acted as a mediator between the West and Tehran in the past. The two countries met in Muscat on Saturday, April 12, to explore the possibility of a new nuclear agreement.Iranian state television said on Saturday that Iran and the United States will hold another round of talks next week regarding Tehran's nuclear program. This came at the end of their first meeting since Donald Trump returned as president. According to Iranian state TV, US Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi ""briefly spoke"" with each other — the first direct contact between the two sides since the Obama administration. Iranian state media mentioned the face-to-face conversation, indicating the talks were proceeding in a positive direction.The White House issued a statement on Saturday afternoon saying the discussions were ""very positive and constructive,"" but also noted that the issues involved ""are very complicated.""""Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,"" the White House said.Both the Iranian and American sides said the next round of talks will take place on Saturday, April 19.In 2018, President Trump withdrew the US from an earlier nuclear deal involving Iran and other world powers and reimposed economic sanctions. This move was strongly opposed by Iran.President Trump has also said that military action is possible if the talks do not lead to an agreement.Iran is not allowed to have nuclear weapons because it is a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it signed along with most other countries. This agreement allows countries to use nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes, like energy, medicine, and agriculture. It strictly prohibits the development of nuclear weapons.Although Iran says its nuclear programme is only for civilian use, many countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are not fully convinced. Concerns grew in 2002 when Iran was discovered to have secret nuclear facilities, which violated the NPT. This led to suspicion that Iran might be working toward building nuclear weapons, even though it continues to deny those claims.Moreover, countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United States worry that if Iran gets nuclear weapons, it could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and, consequentially, more instability in the already turmoiled region.The US and its allies also see Iran as a threat because of its support for groups like Hezbollah and its opposition to Western influence in the region. Giving Iran access to nuclear weapons could make it harder to contain its regional power.The 2015 nuclear deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was an agreement between Iran and six world powers—the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany—aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme by reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium, cutting the number of centrifuges, and allowing regular inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).In return, international sanctions on Iran were lifted, helping its economy and giving it access to global markets. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal and reinstated sanctions, after which Iran began breaching some of the agreement’s terms.Since the United States left the nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and brought back sanctions, Iran has responded by not following key parts of the deal.It has set up thousands of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, which the JCPOA had banned. To make nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be enriched to 90 per cent purity. Under the JCPOA, Iran was only allowed to keep up to 300kg of uranium enriched to 3.67 per cent , which is suitable for peaceful uses like energy and research.However, by March 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had around 275kg of uranium enriched to 60 per cent. If enriched further, that amount could possibly be enough to make about six nuclear weapons. US officials believe Iran could produce enough material for one bomb in roughly a week, but actually making a usable weapon might take between one year and 18 months. Some experts believe Iran could put together a basic nuclear device in six months or even less.Before the 2015 nuclear deal, the UN, US, and EU had placed tough economic sanctions on Iran, suspecting it was trying to build a nuclear bomb. These sanctions blocked Iran from selling oil internationally and froze about $100 billion of its assets. This caused a deep recession and rising inflation in Iran.In 2015, Iran and six world powers (US, UK, France, China, Russia, and Germany) agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limited Iran’s nuclear activities and allowed international inspections. In return, the sanctions were lifted. The deal was supposed to last up to 15 years.However, when Donald Trump became US president in 2018, he pulled the US out of the agreement. He called it a ""bad deal"" because it wasn’t permanent and didn’t cover Iran’s missile programme. He re-imposed US sanctions as part of a “maximum pressure” strategy to push Iran into a new deal. Trump’s move was also supported by US allies like Israel, which claimed Iran was secretly continuing its nuclear programme and could use the money from sanctions relief to boost its military.The US, under President Donald Trump, is aiming to reach a new deal with Iran that goes beyond the 2015 nuclear agreement. Trump wants to prove he can negotiate a “better” deal, one that not only limits Iran’s nuclear programme more strictly but also addresses issues like ballistic missiles and regional influence.The goal is to ease tensions in the Middle East, especially between Iran and Israel, and prevent a wider conflict. Israel, meanwhile, remains deeply suspicious of Iran and wants any future agreement to fully eliminate Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons. ""The deal with Iran is acceptable only if the nuclear sites are destroyed under US supervision,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said this week. ""Otherwise, the military option is the only choice.""Both sides are approaching talks cautiously, given the deep mistrust after the US pulled out of the original JCPOA and imposed harsh sanctions on Iran.But what’s at Stake?The future of the original 2015 nuclear deal is hanging by a thread, especially with its strictest limits set to expire soon. If the agreement collapses completely, Iran could move closer to developing a nuclear weapon—raising fears of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.This poses a direct threat to Israel and could destabilize the region further. There's also concern that Iran might share its nuclear know-how with militant or terrorist groups, intensifying global security risks. The outcome of ongoing talks could determine whether diplomacy prevails or tensions spiral toward conflict.While the US may offer sanctions relief to help revive Iran’s battered economy, Tehran is unlikely to give up its nuclear programme altogether. Since the US exit from the 2015 deal, Iran has expanded its uranium stockpile significantly, enriching some of it up to 60 per cent —just a short technical step from weapons-grade.One thing it won't do is give up its programme entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution - ""you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution"" - unworkable, the news agency Associated Press reported.Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.",Iranian state television said on saturday that iran and the united states will hold another round of talks next week regarding tehran's nuclear program.

Indonesia palm oil firms eye new markets as US trade war casts shadow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indonesia-palm-oil-firms-eye-new-markets-as-us-trade-war-casts-shadow/articleshow/120246999.cms,"Representative image

Smallholder pain

JAKARTA: Indonesian palm oil companies are seeking new markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East as they try to protect themselves from the impact of Donald Trump's trade war, a top industry executive told AFP.Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of the edible oil -- used in making foods such as cakes, chocolate, and margarine as well as cosmetics, soap and shampoo -- and accounts for more than half the global supply.But the 32 percent tariffs imposed on the country make it one of Asia's hardest hit by the US president's sweeping measures that have sent shockwaves around the world.Palm oil is one of Indonesia's biggest exports to the United States, and while Trump has announced a 90-day pause on implementing the levies, producers say the uncertainty is forcing them to look elsewhere to earn their keep.""It actually gives time for us to negotiate... so products can still enter there. I think this is very good,"" said Eddy Martono, chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) on Thursday.However, he warned that market diversification ""must still be done"" to avoid the impact of the tariffs if they come into force later in the year, adding that firms would look to Africa -- specifically top importer Egypt -- the Middle East, Central Asia and Eastern Europe.""We should not just depend on traditional markets. We will continue to do it. We have to do that,"" he said.Exports of palm oil products to the United States have steadily grown in recent years, with Indonesia shipping 2.5 million tons in 2023, compared with 1.5 million tons in 2020, according to GAPKI data.Eddy called on Jakarta to keep its dominance in that market through talks, particularly as rival palm oil producer Malaysia was hit with lower tariffs.""Indonesian palm oil market share in the United States is 89 percent, very high. This is what we must maintain,"" he said.According to Indonesian government data, the United States was the fourth-largest importer of palm oil in 2023, behind China, India and Pakistan.But Eddy remained confident the US would still need Indonesian palm oil if no deal was sealed when the 90 days are up.""It is still a necessity for the food industry. I believe our exports to the US will slightly decline or at least stagnate,"" he said.""Those who are harmed first are consumers in America because their main food industry products need palm oil.""Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said at an economic meeting Tuesday that she would lower a crude palm oil export tax, alleviating some of the pain.While Eddy welcomed the move, saying it would make Indonesia's palm oil exports more competitive, for the country's 2.5 million palm oil smallholder farmers, the threatened tariffs were worrying.Mansuetus Darto, the national council chairman of the Palm Oil Farmers Union (SPKS) said the measures would have had a far-reaching impact if a deal wasn't struck.""The raw material of the palm oil will pile up and then farmers cannot harvest anymore because of overcapacity in existing plants,"" he said before the pause was announced.President Prabowo Subianto opted for a path of negotiation with Washington instead of retaliation and will send a high-level delegation later this month.While Trump took aim at Indonesia's billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States, Prabowo said his threatened levies may have done Indonesia a favour by ""forcing"" it to be more efficient.Chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto also said Jakarta would buy more products such as liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas to close the gap with the world's biggest economy.That has given hope to the industry that a deal with Trump can be done, otherwise they will be forced to turn elsewhere.""There is still time,"" said Mansuetus after the pause was announced.""The government should prepare to negotiate as best as possible with the US government.""","Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of the edible oil and accounts for more than half the global supply.

ISLAMABAD: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been re-elected as Chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) for the next four years after the party's intra-party elections held at the Central Secretariat in Islamabad, The Express Tribune reported.The elections were conducted according to the PPP's constitution and finalised key leadership positions for the next four years. In addition, Humayun Khan was chosen as PPP's Secretary General, and Nadeem Afzal Chan was elected Secretary of Information.Aamna Piracha has been chosen as Secretary Finance, completing the list of newly appointed senior officials, The Express Tribune reported. According to the PPP's internal electoral framework, all party officials were elected for a four-year term.Earlier on April 4, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the PPP rejected the government's canal project, terming it ""unilateral"" and warning that it would harm farmers in Punjab, Dawn reported.On February 15, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir inaugurated the Cholistan project to irrigate south Punjab's lands amid public outcry and strong reservations in Sindh.Meanwhile, in March, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against building six new canals on the Indus River. The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water."" Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said, ""Be it Musharraf's unilateral canal proposal, or that of the PTI founder, there is no forum where we have not taken up our struggle."" He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab. These are reservations we have had for a very long time.""

Alhurra , a US-funded Arabic-language news network created in 2004 to offer an American perspective in the middle east, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff following the Trump administration's move to halt financial transfers to government-backed media outlets, including Alhurra’s parent company, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN).The network was launched in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq to counter anti-American sentiment in Arabic media, especially that from Al-Jazeera, writes news agency AFP. Alhurra reached over 30 million viewers weekly across 22 countries but struggled to compete with well-established networks like Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabiya, and Sky News Arabia.Jeffrey Gedmin, MBN’s president and CEO, criticised the funding cut, saying it leaves the field open to extremist narratives. “It makes no sense to kill MBN as a sensible alternative,” Gedmin said. He added that the Trump administration, particularly Kari Lake—the official overseeing US international broadcasting—refused to meet with him or address concerns over what he calls “unlawfully” blocked funds.""I'm left to conclude that she is deliberately starving us of the money we need to pay you, our dedicated and hard-working staff,"" he wrote.Gedmin also said Alhurra would stop broadcasting but attempt to continue limited digital operations with a significantly reduced team.The shutdown is part of a broader budget reduction effort, reportedly influenced by Elon Musk, which has already affected other US-funded outlets like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Some organisations, such as Radio Free Europe, are now looking for support from foreign governments to survive.","Alhurra, a us-funded arabic-language news network created in 2004 to offer an american perspective in the middle east, will stop broadcasting and lay off most of its staff.
