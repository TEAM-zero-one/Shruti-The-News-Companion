Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel didn’t just integrate India. He also helped construct the nation’s democratic institutions...This is the crown jewel of his glittering career. Just after attaining independence from colonial rule in 1947, India was confronted with a major challenge. About 40% of the country was under 565 princely states. Integrating them seamlessly into the fabric of a newly born nation was a masterly act of persuasion. There were some, such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, who held out. That’s when Vallabhbhai Patel, then India’s deputy prime minister and home minister, showed his iron fists. Operation Polo followed, forcing the recalcitrant Nizam to sign “the instrument of accession”. Partition had claimed at least 200,000 lives. Due to Patel’s resolute blend of diplomacy and force, one of the most demanding obstacles to a fully unified India was countered with minimum human cost. Hence, he justifiably became “the Iron Man of India.”The birth of civil services dates back to the early years of British rule. It was “the steel frame” of colonial rule. Which is why many were sceptical about its continuance in free India.Even before Independence, as home minister of the interim govt, Patel had been engaged with the issue of the future of the civil and police services. To that end, he had convened a conference of provincial premiers in Oct 1946. Post Independence, he held the firm view that an all-India merit-based administrative service was fundamental to hold Indians together. His efforts were key to the formation of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) as a replacement to ICS. This was a new steel frame for a newly independent nation. He is said to have told young officers to serve the people with integrity and humility.Patel also outlined the purpose of the census and mapped its vision. In Feb 1950, just 10 months before his death, Patel inaugurated a conference of census superintendents in Delhi. In the conference, the deputy PM underlined that the census will play a vital role in determining India’s administrative policies. “Census, he stated, was no longer a mere counting of heads but involved the extraction of valuable scientific data of sociological importance,” a report published insaid. He further elaborated on the outline of the exercise: “…the present census would devote greater attention to the collection and formulation of basic economic data relating to the means of livelihood of the people and other economic activities of the individual…” Patel further said, “I would like to stress Census affords an opportunity for the Government to reach every home throughout the length and breadth of the country. ” Simply put, Patel put together the building blocks of the first census, which began in 1951.If Champaran Satyagraha brought Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to national prominence, the Bardoli Satyagraha did the same for Patel. Like Champaran, Bardoli was a farmers’ protest against imposition of high taxes. Patel’s methodical and disciplined organisation of a mass movement, which led to a cancellation of the tax raise, earned him the endearing sobriquet of Sardar, by which he was referred to by many for the rest of his life. Much before the Bardoli Satyagraha (1928), though, Patel had provided a glimpse of his abilities while assisting Gandhi in Kheda Satyagraha (1918). This was another battle for peasant rights where Patel showcased his pragmatic leadership style and steadfastness to farmers’ cause.On Jan 17, 1948, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel spoke at Chowpatty in Mumbai. The meeting was attended by at least one lakh people. In an hour-long speech, India’s deputy PM said that if the country was to survive as a nation, it needed a strong army.reported: “Mahatma Gandhi did not believe in armed strength, Sardar Patel added. But as a practical man, he could not accept the Mahatma’s advice so far as the military strength of India was concerned. Our army ought to be strong enough that no power would ever think of interfering in India.”","Sardar vallabhbhai patel helped construct the nation’s democratic institutions.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.","'nicest guy modi, great fighter munir': trump repeats india-pak truce claim; hints at trade deal.

NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Thursday opposed the bail pleas of activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others in the Supreme Court in the UAPA case linked to the alleged conspiracy behind the February 2020 Delhi riots, claiming they conspired to strike at the country’s sovereignty and integrity through a “regime change operation” disguised as a peaceful protest.The police said the offences were part of a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state, warranting “jail and not bail,” news agency PTI reported quoting an affidavit filed before the top court. The agency said it had collected ocular, documentary and technical evidence showing the accused’s “deep-rooted complicity” in allegedly engineering riots across the country on communal lines.The bail pleas of Khalid, Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and Meeran Haider, all booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, are scheduled to be heard on Friday by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.According to the affidavit, the alleged conspiracy aimed to disrupt communal harmony and instigate crowds “to the extent of armed rebellion.” The police also said the accused planned to escalate tensions during the visit of US President Donald Trump, in order to attract international media attention and portray the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as a global issue.""The materials on record, including chats referencing President Trump, establish that the conspiracy was pre-planned to coincide with his visit,” the affidavit stated, adding that the CAA was used as a “radicalising catalyst” camouflaged as a peaceful movement.The police further alleged that the accused have delayed and obstructed the trial, calling their conduct a ""brazen abuse of process."" It said the argument that there are more than 900 witnesses was misleading, asserting that only 100–150 witnesses are material to the case and can be examined swiftly if the accused cooperate.","Delhi police alleges 2020 riots were timed with trump visit and aimed to spark pan india unrest.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank has long been known for his impact on the field and in the community — but his latest act of generosity reaches far beyond football. In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, Blank has pledged a massive $2.5 million through the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation to help support recovery efforts across the Caribbean.Hurricane Melissa tore through the Caribbean earlier this month, leaving widespread devastation in its wake. The storm first hit Jamaica as a powerful Category 5 hurricane, bringing winds close to 185 mph. Homes were destroyed, neighborhoods flooded, and hundreds of thousands lost power. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a disaster area as rescuers struggled to reach the hardest-hit communities. After pounding Jamaica, the hurricane moved north toward Cuba, where it made landfall as a Category 3 storm and caused even more destruction. Early assessments show that the damage is severe, and recovery will likely take years as families rebuild and essential services are restored.To help provide food, water, and medical aid to those affected, Arthur Blank’s foundation is donating $2.5 million to two major relief organizations.World Central Kitchen will receive $1.5 million to serve meals and deliver clean water to people displaced by the storm. Team Rubicon will get $1 million to help clear debris, respond to emergencies, and begin rebuilding efforts. This isn’t the first time Blank has stepped up to help communities in need, but this donation feels especially personal. He’s said that the Caribbean holds a special place in his family’s heart, making the devastation from Hurricane Melissa hit even closer to home.“We're humbled to support Team Rubicon and World Central Kitchen with an initial grant to help address immediate needs in the community with disaster relief and nourishing meals,” Blank said. He added that while the recovery will take time, he hopes the contribution offers strength and comfort to those affected.The Falcons owner’s quick action has drawn widespread praise from humanitarian groups.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-taliban pakistan’s (ttp) second-in-command amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

Trump’s surprise before meeting Xi



'With others doing testing, it’s appropriate we do too'



China, Russia react sharply



Experts warn of dangerous escalation



Race among nuclear powers



Peace talk or power play?







US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday defended President Donald Trump’s decision to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 33 years, saying it was crucial to help America ""certainly catch up"" with China.""The US is lagging China in nuclear power development, but we can certainly catch up,"" Bessent said during an interview on Fox Business’s Mornings with Maria. ""It’s all hands on deck for nuclear power,"" he added.Bessent’s remarks came hours after Trump ordered the Pentagon to immediately restart nuclear weapons testing, ending a moratorium that had been in place since 1992.The announcement was made minutes before Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and was widely seen as a show of strength ahead of high-stakes trade talks between Washington and Beijing.Bessent also pointed to what he described as a major trade win from the Xi-Trump meeting. ""Trump got China to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season,"" he said.""Between now and January, the total will rise — and then for the next three years, they’re going to be buying a minimum of 25 million metric tons per annum,"" he added.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social while aboard Marine One en route to his meeting with Xi at Gimhae Air Base.""Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,"" Trump posted.He added that ""Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”The move followed Russia’s successful tests of its nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo and cruise missile earlier this month, and weapons that President Vladimir Putin hailed as next-generation deterrents.Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said the testing was necessary to ensure US readiness and parity with rival powers.""With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,"" he said, adding that specific test sites would be ""determined later,"" Reuters reported.When asked about the risks of escalating a new nuclear arms race, Trump brushed aside concerns. ""I'd like to see a denuclearisation because we have so many and Russia's second and China's third and China will catch up within four or five years,"" he said""We are actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something,"" he added.Russia’s state-run RIA news agency quoted a senior lawmaker as saying Trump’s decision would usher in ""a new era of unpredictability and open confrontation.""Beijing’s foreign ministry called on Washington to ""honor its commitments"" under international treaties, referring to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), signed by the US but never ratified.Trump’s announcement drew immediate criticism from arms control experts, who called the move unnecessary and provocative. ""The United States has no technical, military, or political reason to resume nuclear explosive testing,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.He noted that the NNSA ""would need at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada,"" adding that much of its workforce remains furloughed due to the ongoing government shutdown.Kimball warned that resuming testing could trigger a dangerous arms race and undermine decades of nuclear restraint. ""Restarting tests could invite reciprocal actions from Russia or China and unravel global nonproliferation efforts,"" he said.Trump’s decision comes just days after Russia announced it had successfully tested two advanced nuclear systems, the Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo and a nuclear-powered cruise missile — moves that the Kremlin said demonstrated its ""technological superiority.”While Trump cited these developments as justification for restarting US testing, analysts say the US already maintains the world’s most advanced and reliable nuclear arsenal.Independent experts estimate that the US possesses around 3,700 nuclear warheads, compared to Russia’s 4,300 and China’s 500–600, though Beijing is rapidly expanding its arsenal. The Pentagon has projected that China could surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030, a figure still far behind Washington and Moscow.Trump, however, has repeatedly claimed that the United States has ""the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons.”Analysts say Trump’s announcement, coming moments before his trade meeting with Xi, was intended as both a negotiating tool and a demonstration of US dominance.""If the United States indeed begins developing similar nuclear delivery technologies, there is a significant chance that Beijing would follow suit,"" Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told Washington Post.""Continued Russian progress and parallel US development could further incentivize China to accelerate its own research programs to avoid being left behind,"" Zhao added.Trump later described his meeting with Xi as ""very friendly,"" saying he agreed to visit China in April 2026, with Xi expected to visit the US later next year.","Us treasury secretary scott bessent defended president donald trump’s decision to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 33 years.

Trump vs Xi: The Busan showdown



Round 1: Trump declares victory (again)



Round 2: Xi’s quiet power play



Round 3: Strategy vs showmanship



Round 4: Managed stability, fragile peace



Final score: Optics to Trump, substance to Xi







It takes a certain kind of genius to let Donald Trump take a victory lap, and still walk away holding the trophy. On Thursday, as Trump declared his meeting with Xi Jinping a “12 out of 10” success (because of course he did), the Chinese leader smiled politely, nodded in agreement, and pocketed a handful of US concessions like souvenirs from a diplomatic gift shop.While Trump gushed on Air Force One about “tremendous progress” and future golf-course diplomacy, Xi quietly secured a tariff rollback, suspended port fees, and a reprieve for Chinese tech firms.If this were a game of poker, Trump was busy telling everyone he’d won big, while Xi casually raked in the chips. With his trademark calm and a dash of subtle shade (“the recent twists and turns should be instructive,” he told Trump), Xi showed once again that in the delicate art of letting Trump claim the win while quietly tightening his own grip, China’s leader might just be the true master of the deal.Fresh off his meeting with Xi Jinping, Trump was in full salesman mode. From Air Force One, he called the talks a “12 out of 10” success, announced plans to visit China in April, and told reporters that “a lot of things” had been finalized.For his audience back home, Trump framed it as another “America Wins” moment -- soybeans for farmers, promises to tackle fentanyl, and friendly photo-ops with a “great leader of a great country.”Following the meeting between the two leaders, China’s commerce ministry announced that it would suspend the rare earth export restrictions introduced in October for one year.While Trump grabbed the headlines, Xi walked away with the hard gains. By flexing China’s near-monopoly on rare earths and its control over US agricultural imports, Xi secured tariff reductions, suspended port fees, and a pause on US export restrictions targeting Chinese tech firms.He even extended a tariff truce, all while maintaining the image of calm, rational statesmanship.Trump announced that he would reduce by half the 20% tariffs previously imposed on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing over fentanyl trafficking. The move, he said, lowered overall tariffs on Chinese imports from about 57% to 47%.Meanwhile, China’s commerce ministry confirmed that both sides agreed to extend for another year the tariff truce that was due to expire on November 10.Trump’s strength lied in optics -- dramatic handshakes, bold declarations, and a good headline for Truth Social. Xi, meanwhile, played the long game. Analysts said Beijing pocketed US concessions by exploiting Washington’s lack of clear strategy. “Tactics without a strategy,” as one expert put it, left Trump celebrating moves that effectively restored the pre-tariff status quo. In other words, Xi gave Trump his “win,” but only after resetting the board in China’s favor.""I think it's an approach that can safely be described as tactics without a strategy,"" NYT quoted Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously analyzed Chinese politics at the CIA saying.""Ostensibly, the goal was to address some of the meaty trade issues that had long bedeviled the relationship. Instead, the PRC side has successfully orchestrated a game of 'whack-a-mole' for the Trump administration,"" Czin added.For now, both sides are enjoying what Beijing calls a “period of managed stability.” Xi even echoed Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric, playing to his ego while ensuring China’s interests were secured.Yet, the calm could be short-lived, a single new sanction or export ban could unravel the deal. As one analyst quipped, “These are the kinds of truces that look good on paper, until the next tweet.”Trump may have won the spotlight, but Xi emerged with tangible gains. One got the headline; the other got the leverage.While Trump touted “tremendous progress,” the outcomes showed Beijing securing key concessions behind the scenes, leaving Washington with more talk than trade wins.However, with no finalized agreement in place, the durability of the current situation remains uncertain.""Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen this movie too many times, but these are issues that are relatively easy to roll back and also to accuse the other side of bad faith,"" NYT quoted a political science professor Ja Ian Chong saying.","Donald trump and xi jinping met in busan, south korea, on thursday.

JD Vance-Usha Vance rumors







Vice President JD Vance came under a lot of fire Thursday after he sided with Christianity and expressed his wish that his Hindu wife Usha Vance who, according to JD is not a very religious person, embrace Christianity. JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him. ""I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else,"" Psaki said. ""I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you,"" Jen Psaki said.""And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him,"" Psaki said.JD Vance said the comments are disgraceful, but the Second Lady can speak for herself. ""I am very lucky to have a wonderful wife. I hope that my wife feels the same about me. We will keep on serving the country together,"" JD Vance recently said when he was in Israel with his wife.","Jd vance converted to catholicism in august 2019, long after jd vance's marriage to usha vance.

FBI's Kash Patel Announces BIG Arrests: NBA Gambling Ring Bust, Terry Rozier, Billups Arrested





FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of using an FBI jet to attend girlfriend Alexis Wilkins ' performance at a pro-wrestling event on Saturday. The accusation came from Kyle Seraphin, a MAGA former FBI agent-turned-critic podcaster. “We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said on his podcast. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”“He flew a $60 million aircraft to go hang out there. Is that gross to anybody else?” he said.The FBI did not comment on it and Patel has also not issued any statement on the accusation.Seraphin claimed that a government jet took off from a northern Virginia airport, then landed at State College, Pennsylvania’s regional airport near the campus, right around the time Patel was headed there. The jet is registered with the FAA as government-owned, with its owner’s address as the FBI’s Washington headquarters, Seraphin claimed, adding that the jet's travel list earlier this week matches that of Patel's as the jet traveled from Washington to Philadelphia, matching with Patel's appearance at a press conference there.FBI directors have to pay the price of a commercial coach ticket if they use their government planes for their private use.Kash Patel once called for ending former FBI director Christopher Wray's use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel.

Britain’s King Charles has taken the extraordinary step of stripping his younger brother, Prince Andrew, of all his remaining titles and honours and ordering him to vacate his Windsor residence, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday.The decision came after weeks of pressure on the palace. Earlier this month, Andrew gave up using the title Duke of York because of renewed attention on his friendship with the late sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The King has now gone a step further by removing the title of “prince,” which Andrew has had since he was born to the late Queen Elizabeth II.In a statement, the palace said that Andrew would no longer be known as a prince, but instead by his full name, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. It also confirmed that a formal notice had been served requiring him to surrender the lease of his mansion, Royal Lodge, within the Windsor Castle grounds. The Duke will be moved to alternative private accommodation.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,"" it added.""The announcement comes as new reports have deepened the row surrounding the 65-year-old royal. BBC investigations recently confirmed that Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein were hosted at Royal Lodge during Princess Beatrice’s 18th birthday celebrations in 2006. The revelation is a major one because Epstein was already facing a US arrest warrant for sexual assault at the time.Epstein and Weinstein reportedly attended a small gathering on the lawn before joining the larger party at Windsor Castle. A photograph reportedly matched the trio to the Royal Lodge garden. Andrew has not commented on the claims.The Duke has been under fire for years over his friendship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in the United States for helping Epstein procure underage girls, while Weinstein has been convicted of multiple sexual assaults.Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after a disastrous BBC interview in which he defended his relationship with Epstein. He later settled a civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was a minor, though he continues to deny all allegations.","King charles strips prince andrew of all his remaining titles and honours.

Political commentator and Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker’s old remarks were brought up during a US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on October 29, 2025. Conservative media host Michael J. Knowles mentioned HasanAbi’s viral 2025 comments about capitalism while discussing political violence in America. Knowles told senators that Hasan once said things like, “Kill them! Kill those motherf**kers! Let the streets soak in their red capitalist blood.” These comments had gone viral in September 2025 and sparked backlash from public figures like Elon Musk, who accused Hasan of inciting violence.During the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Michael J. Knowles used HasanAbi’s past statements to highlight what he called an “ideological problem on the left.”He reminded the committee that Hasan Piker had earlier made violent remarks about property owners and conservatives. Knowles said those remarks were resurfacing after the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.He said, “The New York Times reacted by publishing the assassination-related musings of Hasan Piker, a prominent left-wing streamer, who has suggested the assassination of Senator Tom Cotton and said, ‘Kill those motherf**kers in the streets!’”Michael J. Knowles told senators that such comments, even if meant as satire, show how far violent political talk has spread online.He argued that these examples prove that “violence is being normalized” in America’s online political spaces.Michael J. Knowles also brought up the recent “CollarGate” controversy around HasanAbi. On October 7, 2025, clips surfaced online showing Hasan using an electronic collar on his dog, Kaya. Many accused him of animal abuse, but Hasan Piker said the collar only vibrated and did not shock the dog.Also Read: Nina Lin Banned On Twitch Again After New Viral Clips Sparks Backlash Michael J.
