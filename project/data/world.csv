India-Russia summit key opportunity to review ties

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to visit India in the first week of Dec for the 23rd India-Russia annual summit.Diplomatic sources said the two sides are considering Dec 5-6 as dates for the visit. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will travel to India next month to finalise the agenda for the summit.This will be Putin’s first India visit since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in Feb 2022. Putin last visited India in Dec 2021 for the annual summit that is held alternatively in India and Russia. PM Modi travelled to Moscow for the last summit in July last year.During his visit, Modi stressed before Putin that no solution can be found on the battlefield. The leaders last met on the margins of the SCO summit. Modi hopped into Putin’s car for an informal chat that lasted for almost 45 minutes.The summit is a key opportunity to review bilateral ties in trade, energy, connectivity, and joint defence manufacturing, as India faces US penalties for energy ties with Moscow. India last week denied NATO chief Mark Rutte’s claim that US tariffs pushed Modi to confront Putin on Ukraine strategy.Russian deputy ambassador Roman Babushkin was quoted as saying earlier that Russia is the only country that can offer to India “sophisticated weapons like 5th generation fighter jets, common joint production of its components & licensed production”.India and Russia on Wednesday held a meeting of their Special Mechanism on Pakistan and Afghanistan to discuss regional security issues. “We are preparing for Putin’s visit to India in Dec. We meet regularly bilaterally and on the sidelines of international events,” said India’s deputy NSA Pavan Kapoor in Moscow, according to Russia’s Tass news agency.",Vladimir putin is likely to visit india in the first week of dec for the 23rd india-russia annual summit.

NEW DELHI: India has not invited Pakistan and China to a conclave of Army chiefs of UN troop-contributing nations here from October 14 to 16, even as officials reiterated New Delhi’s policy of not deploying troops to foreign conflict zones like Ukraine or Gaza unless explicitly mandated by the UNSC and under the UN flag.Army deputy chief (IS&T) Lt-Gen Rakesh Kapoor said the meet, with senior military leaders from over 30 nations, will foster cooperation and “a stable international order.”Asked about possible deployments, defence ministry joint secy Vishwesh Negi said such a move is “unlikely” given UNSC dynamics. Kapoor added, “India deploys troops overseas only under UN flag.”India has been one of the largest contributors of troops for UN peacekeeping operations around the world since 1950s. “In 75 years, India has contributed over 2.9 lakh peacekeepers spread across 50 UN missions...182 peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice,” Lt-Gen Kapoor said.",India has not invited pakistan and china to a conclave of army chiefs of un troop-contributing nations.

'Resilient Despite Attempts To Crush It': PM Modi Praises RSS' Unbroken Spirit And Service

NEW DELHI: Congress said the party and other ideological groups fought for the freedom struggle, while RSS sided with the British, as it slammed PM Narendra Modi ’s claim at a function on Wednesday.Congress posted on social media a video of party president Mallikarjun Kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (RSS) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the British”. It said while the entire country rose against the British during Quit India movement in 1942, RSS decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.“It is our country’s misfortune that workers of a communal and hateful organisation like RSS are directly running govt. Those who have always advocated for Manusmriti over the Constitution are now becoming CMs and PMs in our country. How can we expect social, political, and economic justice from them?” the party asked. “While Congress, socialists, communists, and other revolutionary organisations were repeatedly banned, the British regime never imposed any ban on RSS. None of its volunteers were ever sent to jail, so they could stay outside and poison people’s mind with Hindu-Muslim division,” it added.“Even 78 years after Independence, RSS has only one agenda — seizing power by igniting Hindu-Muslim tensions, capturing institutions, and spreading hatred and frenzy. The situation is such that today, by misusing power, RSS has started selling out the country. If it is said that RSS is the root of most problems in the country, it would not be an exaggeration. The day this organisation stops setting the country on fire and hollowing it out, more than half of the problems will be resolved,” Congress said.","Congress posted on social media a video of party president mallikarjun kharge asking, “tell us how many of your people (rss) went to the jail, and how many were hanged by the british” it said while the entire country rose against the british during quit india movement in 1942, rss decided to join hands with the imperial masters to suppress the agitation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124266201,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-486194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Condoleezza Rice, who was then US secretary of state, flew in two or three days after I took over… to say, 'please don't react',” he said.Chidambaram, who took over as home minister just days after the attack, also acknowledged that he discussed possible retributive steps with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other key figures. “The Prime Minister had discussed this even when the attack was going on...

NEW DELHI: RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Wednesday celebrated the govt’s decision to release a commemorative postage stamp and coin as a “societal recognition” of the Sangh ’s century-long contribution, while defence minister Rajnath Singh marked the occasion by highlighting the role of swayamsevaks in communal harmony and nation building.Speaking at the Sangh’s centenary celebrations, where PM Narendra Modi was the chief guest, Hosabale said, “The release of the stamp and coin was emblematic of RSS’s journey from the fringes to the mainstream. Indifference, opposition, struggle — these all had to be overcome. Yet, while walking the path of indifference and opposition, today the Sangh has reached the stage of acceptance,” he said, adding that RSS is now being identified with India’s “civilisational philosophy”.The Rs 100 coin celebrating RSS’s contribution to nation building carries the national emblem on one side and on the other, an image of ‘Bharat Mata’ in Varad Mudra, with a lion being saluted by swayamsevaks — a depiction the PM noted as the first instance of Bharat Mata’s image appearing on Indian currency. The coin also bears the Sangh’s motto, “Rashtraya Swaha, Idam Rashtraya, Idam Na Mama.”Positioning the Sangh as a custodian of values rooted in Indian tradition, he said, “RSS has arrived — not merely as an organisation; it has come while practising for an idea.It is the idea of this soil, this land’s civilisation and culture.” “The Sangh opposes no one... taking all of society along, moving forward together — this is the Sangh’s song,” he said.Highlighting RSS’s contributions, Singh said it played the role of a saviour during the 1984 anti- Sikh riots, providing shelter, protection and relief to the Sikh community. “Noted author Khushwant Singh acknowledged this publicly when he said that RSS played an honourable role in maintaining Hindu-Sikh unity before and after Indira Gandhi’s assassination,” Singh said.On RSS being often unfairly criticised regarding its relationship with Mahatma Gandhi, he said that while it is true there were some differences of opinion on certain issues — as there were within the Congress fold itself — it would be “misleading to portray their relationship in terms of hostility or rivalry”. “Their differences never stood in the way of the mutual regard they shared. This was evident in 1934, when Gandhi ji visited an RSS camp in Wardha. He was struck by the organisation’s discipline, complete absence of untouchability, and rigorous simplicity,” he said.",Hosabale calls rss custodian of india’s civilisational philosophy.

Trump Reposts PM Modi’s PM Modi’s Message Supporting 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan,Hamas Yet To Respond

.

Where are the people of Gaza themselves in the system of governance proposed? Where is the roadmap for a full-fledged Palestinian state to come into being? How much longer will the US and Israel continue to ignore Palestinian statehood - which has already been recognised by 157 member-countries of the UN with India having led the way in Nov 1988? Where is the accountability for the genocide that has been carried out in Gaza over the past twenty months?

Trump-Netanyahu 20-point plan:

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the ongoing Gaza war, calling it extreme “moral cowardice.”In a post on X, Ramesh said, “The PM has maintained a complete silence on the horrific atrocities that have led to the killing of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza. This is extreme moral cowardice and a total betrayal of all that India has stood for. ”Ramesh alleged that to appease President Donald Trump and in solidarity with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, PM Modi has welcomed Trump’s new 20-point plan for Gaza, while fundamental and disturbing questions about the plan remain.He also raised four fundamental questions on the US-led initiative:Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera supported Jairam Ramesh’s criticism.In a post on X, he wrote that “any plan that undermines the agency of the long-oppressed Palestinian people and fails to ensure accountability for the genocide they have endured since 2023 is deserving of contempt and condemnation.”Khera added that “true justice can be restored only through the establishment of the Palestinian state” and warned that “everything else is a mere smokescreen to perpetuate the occupation.”On Tuesday, PM Modi welcomed President Trump’s announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.In a post on X, he wrote: “We welcome President Donald J Trump's announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict. It provides a viable pathway to long-term and sustainable peace, security and development for the Palestinian and Israeli people, as also for the larger West Asian region.”The prime minister expressed hope that “all concerned will come together behind President Trump’s initiative and support this effort to end conflict and secure peace.”Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the plan on Monday. The 20-point proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, protection of civilians on both sides and stronger regional cooperation with international monitoring to ensure compliance. It is unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.Trump described it as a detailed step-by-step framework aimed at ending the conflict and restoring stability.India was one of the first countries to recognise a Palestinian state in 1988 and also supported a two-state solution at the UN.Since the nearly three-year war began, over 65,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry.","Senior congress leader jairam ramesh criticised prime minister narendra modi for remaining silent on the ongoing gaza war.

The Cool Desert project

Jodhpur RIFF festival will run from October 2nd to October 6th at the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur

If the frenzy of hopping between gigs headlined by Coldplay or Diljit Dosanjh has left you drained, picture instead a festival that blends ancient music forms with contemporary influences, bringing together performances where genres flow together: from Rajasthani folk with classical jazz to beats of electronica and African percussion, with room for even reggae, Celtic and Romani traditions. No mad scramble for tickets, no rush-hour traffic.Jodhpur RIFF, India’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort, is built on living traditions of communities sharing their history and values with new audiences and generations by using rare instruments and a frequent focus on themes that reflect on everyday life, social conditions, love, struggle and empowerment. The 18th edition, opening October 2, gathers over 290 artists from the state of Rajasthan and 12 countries, including Portugal, Poland, Finland, Switzerland, Colombia, Canada, Bhutan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Unlike typical global pop culture festivals, RIFF, run under the aegis of the Mehrangarh Museum Trust in Jodhpur, presents musicians who are stars in their homelands but often unknown abroad. ""Our notion of celebrity is shaped only by the media,"" says Divya Bhatia, festival director. ""But beyond globally known names, most of us are unaware of the true stars in different countries,"" he adds.""Similarly, the Rajasthani folk artists we present are among the greatest in the state.You won’t find them playing in small urban venues like Piano Man or Oddbird, but Jodhpur RIFF gives them a stage. India should take note of this,"" says Bhatia, listing out the spectrum of international artists performing this year, including Basel Rajoub, a Syrian-Swiss jazz saxophonist and Aga Khan Master Musician to Karolina Cicha, a Polish singer and multi-instrumentalist who delves into Tartar and Yiddish roots music. Portugal will bring the soulful fado of Helder Moutinho, while Colombia’s Killabeatmaker will blend Afro-Colombian and indigenous rhythms, apart from Bhutanese folk singer Sonam Dorji taking the stage. This year, the festival is also introducing artists from countries RIFF has never hosted before, such as Portugal, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.Shashmaqam, a thousand-year-old classical music tradition from Central Asia with shamanic roots, is also making its debut at the festival. Incorporating poetry, melody and Sufi elements, it will be performed by Layla Tazhibayeva and Gulzoda Khudoynazarova from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. On the other hand, London-based singer-songwriter Rosa Cecilia will infuse Latin jazz, neo-soul and disco with personal storytelling in her performance.The edition will also present one of India’s only women khartal players, young Mamta Sapera, alongside Padma Shri awardee Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, who brings the classical khayal tradition of Jaipur-Atrauli with her vocal artistry. The younger generation is also in focus with groups like SAZ, a trio committed to preserving and evolving the Langa musical tradition through original compositions and collaborations. ""Last year, we released an album cover for SAZ. Their song 'Sundar Gori' has 1.4 million views on YouTube, and their music video has over 400,000 views. They could well be the celebrities of tomorrow. They will also release an album early next year. While most people only know of the Manganiyar, Langa are also now international celebrities,"" says Bhatia.From Tamil Nadu, fusion band Jatayu will blend Carnatic ragas with jazz and rock. Folk traditions will also be carried forward by the mother-daughter duo Ganga and Sundar, and the sisters Anita and Prem Dangi, rooted in the Rajwadi Maand heritage. Bhanwari Devi, first introduced by Jodhpur RIFF in 2010, returns as a nationally renowned folk vocalist. She has since collaborated with singer Rekha Bhardwaj and gained recognition across India. Bhatia cites Devi as an example of artists nurtured by Jodhpur RIFF who have grown into celebrated names, underscoring the festival’s role in elevating local musicians. ""The lineup is not just bigger this year, but richer,"" Bhatia reflects. ""We are building towards our 20th anniversary in 2027, and the festival's reputation has grown. More artists at the peak of their careers want to be part of this journey.""","Jodhpur riff, india’s leading ""roots"" music festival held annually at the 15th-century mehrangarh fort.

Brittany Renner says she cannot afford high cost of living in California

Brittany Renner claims her son cannot experience the same lifestyle as PJ Washington's family

Brittany Renner claimed that she can’t keep up with California’s high cost of living on the current child support from PJ Washington. With a stark difference between her modest life and Washington’s luxury lifestyle, she is asking the court for a big change. The move has raised questions about fairness in supporting their son’s lifestyle.The couple's first child support deal came from a North Carolina court ruling that was finalized in late September 2025, right before Renner asked for a modification. According to the agreement, Washington had to pay Renner $5,500 each month for their son's expenses, plus a one-time payment of $130,000 to settle past due amounts.This setup was worked out when both parents were living in North Carolina, where expenses were cheaper, and it took into account Washington's income back then as a mid-rotation player for the Hornets.Brittany Renner's request, submitted to the Los Angeles Superior Court on September 29, 2025, claims that the current monthly payment of $5,500 isn't enough anymore because she's moved to California and Washington's financial situation has gotten better.In the papers, which were exclusively acquired by TMZ, Renner addressed the court, ""I cannot afford the high cost of living given the current child support orders.""She further explained, ""I am struggling to make ends meet,"" stressing the full financial responsibility she now shoulders for their son's daily needs.Brittany Renner explained her shift from North Carolina to West Hills, California, mentioning in her filing that the move was crucial for better opportunities but has put a strain on her finances. She asked the court to require Washington to pay ""at least $35,000"" each month, a sum she called necessary to align the child's needs with his father's financial capabilities.Furthermore, Renner requested $50,000 to pay for her attorney fees associated with the modification, claiming it would create a fairer situation in the legal proceedings.A key point in Renner's filing is the clear difference between her humble situation and the wealthy lifestyle in Washington, which she claims puts their son at a disadvantage. She mentioned in court, ""I cannot provide [our son] a life anywhere similar to that of his father,"" using Washington's family social media posts as proof.Renner described her own setup plainly, ""In contrast, I live in a humble Airbnb rental in West Hills and shop for [our son’s] clothes at Target."" By comparison, she noted that Washington and his current wife ""have multiple luxury vehicles, constantly post their designer shopping clothes, and boast about luxury vacations."" She added, ""They also constantly post their children wearing designer clothing,"" underscoring how this disparity affects their shared child's sense of equity.Washington signed a four-year, $89 million contract extension with the Mavericks, this can be the reason why she asked for an increase in child support.Also Read: Napheesa Collier calls out WNBA’s weak leadership after Minnesota Lynx’s playoff collapse against Phoenix Mercury","Brittany renner says she cannot afford high cost of living in california.

Martina Navratilova supports Ariana Grande’s tough questions to Trump voters

“Make America Great Again”

“Have your groceries gotten cheaper? Has your health insurance premium gone down? Has your work/life balance improved?”

White House responds to Ariana Grande with sharp remarks

“Save your tears, Ariana. Because President Trump’s actions ended Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investment.”

“He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande’s concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!”

Martina Navratilova, the tennis legend, has sided with Ariana Grande after the singer strongly criticized Donald Trump and his supporters online. On September 29, 2025, Grande posted a long note on Instagram where she asked Trump voters if their lives had really improved in Trump’s second term. She listed issues like high grocery prices, expensive health insurance, immigrant families being separated, and trans people living in fear. Navratilova reshared the post on her X account with heart emojis, showing she fully supported Grande’s tough questions. The post quickly spread across social media and sparked major debate.Navratilova, known worldwide for her tennis career and outspoken views, reposted Ariana Grande’s message with “❤️❤️❤️” on her X page. This public show of support signaled she agreed with Grande’s frustration toward themovement.Grande’s post directly addressed Trump supporters. She asked:The singer also wrote about the struggles of immigrant families and the fear many trans people face. Grande added that free speech was “on the brink of collapse.” She questioned whether Trump’s promises had brought any real benefit to voters.The message, shared by Occupy Democrats on X, quickly went viral. With Martina Navratilova joining in, the criticism gained extra weight, because it came not just from a popstar but also from one of the most respected sports voices in the world.The White House did not stay silent.

TL:DR: Driving the news

For the first time since 2019, the US government has officially shut down as President Donald Trump and Democrats failed to reach a funding deal before the midnight deadline.

and failed to reach a funding deal before the midnight deadline. At the centre of the standoff: Democrats are demanding an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and a reversal of Medicaid cuts included in Trump ’s tax law. Republicans insist on passing a “clean” short-term bill without policy add-ons.

’s tax law. insist on passing a “clean” short-term bill without policy add-ons. Trump, rather than striking a conciliatory tone, escalated. “We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn’t want and they’d be Democrat things,” he told reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday. “They just don’t learn. So we have no choice. I have to do that for the country.”

The shutdown threatens to furlough up to 750,000 federal workers, disrupt government services, and rattle the US economy.

A showdown years in the making

As Time put it bluntly this week, “This is not one of those moments where everyone knows how the story ends.”

Why it matters

Workers:

Markets:

Voters:

Zoom in: What’s at stake for agencies

Homeland 23,000 employees furloughed; border and TSA continue operations.

Defense: Active-duty troops continue without pay; 400,000 civilian staff affected.

Social Security: Benefits continue, but non-critical services pause.

Education: 87% of staff furloughed; civil rights investigations frozen.

Health and Human Services: More than 32,000 furloughed; CDC cuts guidance during a measles outbreak.

Nasa: 80% furloughed, though Artemis moon missions and ISS operations continue.

Justice Department: 90% remain on duty for prosecutions and investigations.

The big picture

Democrats’ stance:

Republicans’ stance:

Trump’s play:

The likely winner

For now, Democrats may hold a slight edge in the blame game - but Trump’s threats of permanent layoffs, if carried out, could shift pressure onto his opponents.

So who blinks?

Exit ramps?

Extending subsidies but phasing them down over two or three years.

Pairing health care extensions with income caps to limit costs.

A short-term bill to reopen the government while negotiations continue.

What's next?

1. How long before public backlash builds?

2. Do Democrats hold together?

3. Does Trump follow through on layoffs?





The United States government has gone dark - again. At 12:01am on Wednesday morning, Congress missed the deadline to pass a stopgap funding bill. Agencies began powering down. Federal workers were told not to come in. And the political blamegame in Washington escalated into a dangerous and unpredictable test of endurance.This is the first federal shutdown since the winter of 2018-2019, when Trump held the government hostage over border wall funding. That standoff lasted 35 days, the longest in US history. But this time is different - more ideological, less theatrical, and with potentially more lasting damage.The immediate conflict centers around the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which helped millions of Americans afford coverage during the pandemic. Democrats are demanding their extension. Republicans - led by Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson - are refusing, calling the demand “hostage-taking.” The GOP wants a clean funding bill, devoid of what it calls “left-wing policy riders,” even as Democrats insist that health care is non-negotiable.Behind closed doors, both parties admit they’re speaking different languages.The Congressional Budget Office estimates $400 million per day in lost compensation for furloughed employees.While previous shutdowns largely relied on temporary furloughs, Trump has threatened outright firings - an unprecedented step.Stocks fluctuated on Tuesday on uncertainty. A prolonged closure could delay key economic data, including the jobs report due Friday, leaving the Federal Reserve flying blind on interest rate decisions, a Bloomberg report said.With the 2026 midterms looming, both parties see the shutdown as a high-stakes political test. As per a Time report, polling from Morning Consult shows 45% of voters would blame Republicans versus 33% blaming Democrats. Among independents, 41% said they’d hold Republicans responsible.This fight is as much about political leverage as it is about dollars and cents.Party leaders say they’re protecting Americans from spiking health care costs. If subsidies expire at year’s end, premiums could rise by more than 75% on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. “I’m concerned about Americans’ health care. That’s what we Democrats are concerned about,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night.The GOP portrays Democrats as hijacking the process. “They need to release the hostage,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, arguing Democrats are holding up government funding to force policy concessions.The president has framed the shutdown as a chance to cut government “bloat.” He even suggested layoffs could be permanent. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,” he said Tuesday.Democrats’ case: Public opinion favors them, health care is a potent issue, and they see the risk of rising premiums as their strongest card. “We got premiums going up in a matter of weeks. People can’t afford it,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro told MSNBC.Republicans’ case: They believe portraying Democrats as “hostage takers” and holding steady on a clean funding bill will turn the tables.If history is any guide, someone usually caves. But this time, the pressure points aren’t where they used to be.The centrist Democrats who once urged compromise - the Joe Manchins and Claire McCaskills - are mostly gone. And the GOP moderates, like Lamar Alexander or Bob Corker, have been replaced by hardliners who see gridlock as a strategy, not a failure.Inside the Republican leadership, House Speaker Mike Johnson is telling members to “hold the line,” and he’s floated the idea of keeping the House out of Washington until Democrats cave. Senate Republicans, too, are digging in. “They need to release the hostage,” John Thune said, blaming Democrats for the impasse.But the longer the shutdown drags on, the more perilous the road becomes for both parties. The public may sour on Republicans if health premiums spike - and that warning is already baked into internal polling. But Democrats, too, risk being seen as obstructionists if the shutdown begins to hurt average Americans - especially if more of their own begin peeling away to support a GOP stopgap.Despite the posturing, lawmakers have floated potential compromises:The shutdown’s trajectory will be shaped by three questions:Historically, voters sour on shutdowns quickly. In 2013, Republicans took the blame for Ted Cruz’s shutdown fight over Obamacare. Democrats believe this time will play out similarly.Already, three Senate Democrats broke ranks. If more defect, Schumer’s hand weakens dramatically.Furloughs are temporary and historically reversible. Permanent layoffs would transform this shutdown into something far costlier - both economically and politically.(With inputs from agencies)","As lights go out in washington, it’s not clear who wins this showdown.

Poll Do you believe the government shutdown will last longer than two weeks? Yes No

Previous US government shutdowns

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The us government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked congress failed to pass a funding measure.

China-US geopolitical tensions





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","China 'nanoseconds behind' america in chipmaking industry, says nvidia ceo jensen huang.
