‘Whole world now knows the truth’: Shashi Tharoor-led delegation wraps up US visit; urges global terror fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whole-world-knows-the-truth-shashi-tharoor-led-delegation-wraps-up-us-visit-urges-global-terror-fight/articleshow/121713233.cms,"FULL: Tharoor Goes Merciless On U.S. Ally | 'You Misunderstood... Pak Attacked India' | Watch

NEW DELHI: The multi-party parliamentary delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on late Sunday concluded its high-level visit to the United States, wrapping up the final leg of a diplomatic mission aimed at building international consensus on India’s counter-terrorism stance following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.Taking to X as he wrapped up the US visit, Tharoor wrote: “If you are born a hundred times, you will do it a hundred times. I will love my country with all my heart… A Watan. The whole world now knows the truth. We are lovers of non-violence, but only until someone tests that... Jai Hind!”On the final day of the tour, the delegation paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Washington. Tharoor later posted on X: “It is striking how many world capitals are adorned with statues or busts of the Mahatma, the 20th century’s greatest apostle of peace, nonviolence, and human freedom.”The group, which arrived in Washington on June 3 after stops in Guyana, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil, met with several key American leaders including US Vice President JD Vance, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, senior members of Congress, policy experts, and members of the Indian-American community.Describing the meeting with Vance as “an excellent meeting,” Tharoor said the Vice President was “warm and welcoming and receptive,” and “expressed complete understanding, first of all, outrage of what happened in Pahalgam and support and respect for India’s restrained response in Operation Sindoor.”A US State Department spokesperson said Landau “reaffirmed the United States’ strong support of India in the fight against terrorism and the strategic partnership between the two countries.”Addressing the Centre on Foreign Relations, Tharoor had said India’s actions were targeted at terror infrastructure, not civilians. “We're not interested in attacking Pakistani civilians, ordinary people. This is about India versus terrorism… If you're not prepared to shut down the safe havens or arrest terrorist leaders, then I'm afraid this is the only way we can deal with it,” he said.Referring to Pakistan’s military, he added, “In India, the state has an army. In Pakistan, the army has a state,” accusing Islamabad of manipulating public opinion through conflict. Tharoor dismissed claims of Pakistani success during the brief hostilities that followed, saying, “Two videos came out on social media, both turned out to be from other conflicts in other years, nothing to do with this one.”","Congress mp shashi tharoor wraps up high-level visit to the united states.

Justice Kant: Indian judiciary shaped democracy's moral spine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/justice-kant-indian-judiciary-shaped-democracys-moral-spine/articleshow/121713013.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian judiciary has been instrumental in shaping the democracy's moral spine by interpreting the Constitution's textual commands in a way that gave vibrancy and dynamism to the country's governance structure, said Justice Surya Kant, who will become the 53rd Chief Justice of India in Nov.Speaking to legal scholars and students in Seattle (US), he said in Kesavananda Bharti case, SC established the 'basic structure doctrine', which elucidated that while Parliament could amend the Constitution, it could not alter its fundamental identity.Justice Kant said, ""When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy - they deepen it.""While judiciary's proactive stance has often filled legislative or executive voids in advancing rights and justice, it has also, at times, drawn criticism for encroaching upon policy domains traditionally reserved for elected branches of govt, he said. ""This tension invites a deeper inquiry into the legitimacy and limits of judicial intervention in a constitutional democracy,"" he added.He said principles such as the Rule of Law, Separation of Powers and Judicial Review were deemed unamendable.This doctrine, unprecedented at the time, was rooted not in textual literalism, but in an ethical reading of democratic continuity, he said.He juxtaposed the Bharti judgment with the infamous ADM Jabalpur case, in which during emergency SC had acquiesced to the govt's draconian diktat ""no right available to citizens"", and said it was only following the Maneka Gandhi case, immediately after the end of Emergency, that the true expansion of rights happened through SC's interpretative exercises.""In this period, SC has reaffirmed the supremacy of the Constitution and underscored that its foundational values, especially those relating to life and liberty, are inviolable and beyond compromise,"" Justice Kant said.Explaining judicial independence, he said it encompasses the ability to have intellectual and moral independence, that stretches beyond mere institutional autonomy.""The underlying purpose of the independence of the judiciary is that judges must be able to decide a dispute before them according to law, uninfluenced by any other factor,"" he said, addingit is ingrained in the system ,"" he said.","Justice surya kant will become the 53rd chief justice of india in nov.

Protesters clashed with federal immigration agents in Los Angeles County for a second consecutive day on Saturday, after raids at a Home Depot and a nearby meatpacking plant sparked renewed unrest in the Latino-majority suburb of Paramount. The clashes came just 24 hours after ICE detained over 121 people across the city, prompting protests outside a federal processing centre where agents used flash-bang grenades and what advocates said was tear gas. The Trump administration accused city officials of failing to support enforcement efforts, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller calling the protests an “insurrection.” Meanwhile, California leaders, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, condemned the federal crackdown as provocative and politically motivated, even as the National Guard prepared for deployment under a rarely used rebellion clause.Over 121 immigrants were detained in a single day. Protesters hurled glass bottles and fireworks. Law enforcement responded with pepper balls and flash-bangs. At one point, a Home Depot shopping cart was set on fire and melted into a barricade.In Paramount, one of the epicentres of resistance, federal officers used rubber bullets to disperse a growing crowd—many of whom were chanting in Spanish and waving phones in one hand and makeshift placards in the other.Down the street, motorbikes revved between police and protesters like a surreal video game gone wrong. Music blasted, tear gas lingered, and the tension was palpable.Governor Gavin Newsom called the deployment “a spectacle,” arguing that it was not about maintaining order but staging political theatre. “There is no shortage of law enforcement,” he said. “There is a shortage of federal restraint.” The state had not requested troops. It didn’t want them. And yet, by nightfall, they were en route.Trump’s memo referred to the protests as a “form of rebellion.” By invoking the same clause Lyndon B. Johnson once used in 1965 to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama, Trump flipped the script: this time, troops weren’t defending dissent—they were suppressing it.According to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the country faced an “insurrection.” He posted online, “Deport the invaders, or surrender to insurrection. These are the choices.” Meanwhile, Trump’s border czar Thomas Homan doubled down, promising the ICE raids would not stop. “They’re not going to shut us down,” he said.If that sounds familiar, it should. The Trump administration attempted similar tactics during the George Floyd protests of 2020, but ultimately held back on federalizing National Guard forces. This time, there was no hesitation.In a move not seen since the Rodney King riots in 1992, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton were on high alert—ready to be deployed into a major US city. The last time this happened without a governor’s request was nearly 60 years ago.The legal justification? “To protect ICE and federal property.” The political context? Midwestern rallies. Red-state donor pressure. And a GOP base increasingly radicalised by apocalyptic narratives about immigration.Trump’s ICE playbook has evolved. Where once the administration focused on “criminal aliens,” it now targets workforces wholesale—garment factories, construction sites, fast-food chains. In just one week, over 2,000 immigrants were arrested per day, many in dawn raids backed by FBI logistics and IRS intel.The strategy is simple: scale. You can goose arrest numbers faster by raiding a warehouse than by sending agents after individual overstayers. Plus, it sends a chilling message to undocumented workers: no place is safe—not even a laundromat.The raids don’t just affect undocumented migrants. They hit American businesses, too. In industries like construction and landscaping, undocumented workers make up up to 20% of the labour force. One Cleveland builder, Gus Hoyas, put it bluntly: “You get rid of these folks, and it’s going to kill us.”Even hospitality is feeling the pinch. Greg Casten, who runs several D.C. restaurants, warned that losing even 10% of his staff would cripple operations. He’s received annual letters from the IRS about mismatched Social Security numbers. But in today’s climate, those letters now feel like warning shots.Employers walk a tightrope. If they suspect a worker is undocumented and act, they risk discrimination suits. If they don’t, they could be next on the ICE radar. It’s a paradox by design—one that ensures maximum fear with minimal due process.As one immigration lawyer put it: “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.”In the end, this isn’t just about law enforcement—it’s about optics. Trump knows that workplace raids filmed on mobile phones, protests with burning carts, and National Guard convoys on CNN aren’t liabilities. They’re campaign material.It’s a spectacle that energises the base, demoralises the opposition, and distracts from more complex questions—like why America’s immigration system has remained broken through Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, and two rounds of Trump.What’s happening in Los Angeles isn’t just about California. It’s a test case for the limits of federal authority over states—and the future of sanctuary jurisdictions. Trump’s memo, laced with legalese about rebellion and insurrection, effectively criminalises protest when it clashes with immigration enforcement.That should alarm anyone who remembers what the First Amendment stands for. Or what “checks and balances” used to mean.As the dust settles and the tear gas fades, one question lingers: Is this the beginning of a new federal playbook—or the end of state sovereignty?Either way, America just entered a dangerous new chapter. And Los Angeles is its ground zero.","Protesters clashed with federal immigration agents in los angeles county for a second consecutive day on saturday.

India's balancing act

What's the road ahead?

As US President Donald Trump publicly lashes out at Vladimir Putin for dragging out the Ukraine war, Moscow is quietly retooling its Asia strategy putting India front and centre in hopes of countering growing Western influence. While Trump’s frustration with Putin mounts, the Kremlin has ramped up arms deals and diplomatic outreach to New Delhi, aiming to revive the once-promising Russia-India-China (RIC) troika as a foil to the Quad.Trump’s irritation with Putin has grown as the Kremlin delays a ceasefire. While Kyiv reportedly accepted Trump's earlier 30-day truce proposal, Russia refused, insisting on terms that would force Ukraine to surrender territory not even under Russian control. Trump has since offered to host peace talks, but Moscow’s demands, including US recognition of Crimea, have drawn accusations from experts like former ambassador Michael McFaul, who called them “poison pills” meant to derail diplomacy.This has forced Putin to rekindle old alliances as a means to ‘fight, fight, fight’ against the US influence. From arms deals to trilateral summits, Russia is intensifying efforts to woo New Delhi, hoping to revive the Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue as a counterweight to Western influence.The situation became more tricky for New Delhi when US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick delivered a forthright assessment of recent tensions in the India-US relationship, pointing to certain Indian policies that “rubbed the US the wrong way.” These include New Delhi’s continued purchase of military equipment from Russia and its participation in the BRICS grouping, which Lutnick characterised as an attempt to “not support the dollar and dollar hegemony. ”“That’s not really the way to make friends and influence people in America,” Lutnick said, noting that President Trump “calls that out directly,” and the Indian government is now “addressing it specifically.”Despite such differences, Lutnick struck an optimistic tone, calling India’s economy “extraordinary” and praising its “amazing” human capital and growth. He said both countries are working towards a trade agreement and that “you should expect a deal...in the not too distant future.”Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking in Perm on Friday, revealed new efforts to woo India. He claimed Moscow was told India joined the Quad alliance, which includes the US, Australia and Japan, purely for economic cooperation. But Lavrov warned that the alliance is being militarised behind the scenes.“In practice, other countries from the Quad are already trying, already insisting on organising naval and other military exercises,” Lavrov said. “And I’m sure that our Indian friends can see this provocation clearly,” he said.Also read: 'US, other Quad countries trying to force India into military alliance rather than just trade,' claims Russia Lavrov’s remarks came a day before US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s announcement that the US is deepening its military relationship with India. Hegseth cited joint exercises like Tiger Triumph and Towson Sabre as evidence of growing strategic coordination in the Indo-Pacific. He also pointed to the Indo-Pacific Logistics Network and the PIPER initiative as efforts to integrate the region’s defence infrastructure.“Rookies talk strategy, pros talk logistics,” Hegseth said, signalling the US goal of building a sustained and interconnected defence presence in Asia. He emphasised that Trump’s foreign policy was “grounded in common sense and national interest” and stressed that a resilient alliance of like-minded democracies remains America’s greatest strength against Chinese ambitions.But for Russia, these moves are part of what Lavrov describes as a Western ploy to “divide and conquer,” a phrase he says President Putin himself recently used. Lavrov warned that the rebranding of the Asia-Pacific into the “Indo-Pacific” was designed to isolate China and undermine ASEAN.Perhaps the most significant signal from Lavrov was Russia’s renewed push for the revival of the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral dialogue. The forum, originally proposed by former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, has met over 20 times and served as a platform for cooperation in trade, finance, and foreign policy.“Now that… an understanding has been reached between India and China on how to calm the situation on the border, it seems to me that the time has come to revive this RIC troika,” Lavrov said. He framed the grouping as a valuable mechanism that could balance out the influence of Western-led coalitions like the Quad.However, India’s position remains complex. For years, India has enjoyed a privileged status as one of Russia’s largest arms importers. Moscow provided India with cutting-edge weaponry, sometimes even before it was deployed in the Russian military itself.From India’s strategic viewpoint, the RIC format carries other risks. Beijing continues to occupy a key position in South Asia’s strategic balance, primarily through its deepening alliance with Islamabad. India remains concerned that any trilateral cooperation would be undermined unless China reconsiders its longstanding military and nuclear support for Pakistan.Moreover, the RIC format’s perceived anti-American leanings are another sticking point. With Indo-US relations having deepened under both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump, especially on defence and technology cooperation, New Delhi may find it increasingly difficult to align with Russia and China in ways that could appear contrary to its current trajectory.Professor Rajan Kumar, from the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University while speaking with the, said that Russia’s push for a revived RIC format may be “wishful thinking by Russia, and it flies away in context of the real world and the current geo-political landscape.”He agreed, however, with Foreign Minister Lavrov’s warning that the West seeks to “divide and conquer” the India–China relationship.On whether the RIC would serve as a platform for direct mediation with China, Professor Kumar noted that “though India and China are members of several international organisations, like the BRICS and SCO, a direct mediation with China is not possible. Particularly after the Ladakh incident in 2020, after which New Delhi’s trust with Beijing has disappeared.”Asked whether India must align with either the US or Russia, he warned that “given the current policies of the Trump administration, India cannot depend on the United States. As a consequence of the US president’s policy the world has moved towards protectionism, and in the context of defence production this has ruled out the possibility of joint production of weapons.”He further noted India’s longstanding tradition of strategic autonomy, adding, “India has always maintained the policy of strategic autonomy, and it doesn’t have the policy of involving other countries in its policy of China, and India sees China as a rival country. I believe in the coming time the tensions between New Delhi and Beijing are likely to escalate.”On whether Russia taking military equipment from China during its war with Ukraine would have impact on India’s defence dealings with Russia, Professor Kumar observed: “Yes, we do have a certain degree of dependence on Russian defence equipment, as was recently seen in the India-Pakistan war, with the successful use of S-400 on the defensive front and the BrahMos missile on the offensive. But yes, we are also trying to diversify our defence, with deals from Israel and France. ”Professor Rajan welcomed India’s efforts to boost indigenous defence production, noting that “one good thing is that India has also ramped up its own defence production and is moving towards becoming a major defence exporter; however, when compared to other countries its defence dealings are still minuscule.”Speaking on how India’s close ties with Russia can be leveraged to question China’s support for Pakistan, he explained that “India has repeatedly voiced concerns about both China and Pakistan, especially regarding Islamabad’s support for terrorist groups. Yet, India cannot dictate Russian foreign policy, as Moscow is grappling with its own geopolitical constraints. Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has faced isolation and sanctions from the West, compelling it to deepen ties elsewhere. India, while strengthening ties with Western democracies, notably refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia and has abstained from UN resolutions condemning Moscow. This stance reflects India’s effort to balance relations rather than fully aligning with Western positions. Concurrently, India participates in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) alongside the US, Australia, and Japan, a grouping often viewed as a strategic counterweight to China’s influence.”India is poised to maintain its careful balancing act. In practice, New Delhi will likely deepen its defence ties with the US expanding logistics cooperation and joint exercises while continuing to source critical systems from Russia wherever gaps remain in its domestic industry.At the same time, India’s focus on ramping up indigenous production and forging new partnerships with France and Israel suggests that Moscow’s overtures, though acknowledged, will be weighed against broader economic and strategic interests. Whatever shape RIC might take, New Delhi’s core priority will remain safeguarding its own strategic autonomy managing great-power competition without becoming dependent on any single capital.","'india-russia defence deals rubbed us the wrong way' us commerce secretary howard lutnick said.

NEW DELHI: Since Operation Sindoor , Pakistan has been living with fantasies and pushing hard to make the world believe that it won during the conflict against India. With the use of doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns, Islamabad has been claiming that it hit Indian airfields and installations.After the Operation Sindoor, Pakistan portrayed that it hit a Sukhoi-30MKI parked at Adampur air base in Punjab and destroyed an S-400 surface-to-air missile unit at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. However, these assertions have been systematically dismantled by independent satellite imagery analyst Damien Symon, who has been closely examining these claims over the past month.One of the most prominent claims involved a strike on a Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jet at Punjab's Adampur airbase. The image shared to support this showed a fighter near what was presented as a burn mark.But top imagery analyst Damien Symon revealed the truth: the image pre-dated the conflict, the aircraft was a MiG-29 under routine maintenance, and the so-called damage was engine soot buildup from testing, not a missile hit.Another image claimed Pakistan had taken out an S-400 radar system at Bhuj airfield in Gujarat. A closer look showed dark patches on the ground, supposedly impact marks, which turned out to be oil stains in a vehicle maintenance yard.Worse, the image was captured well before hostilities began.A separate claim involved alleged missile damage to the S-400 battery at Adampur. This time, the satellite image was digitally edited, with black dots added to mimic bomb craters. Comparison with current, unedited satellite images showed no such marks at the site.In one of the most absurd claims, Pakistan used an image of Naliya airbase to suggest a bombing raid had darkened the soil. Symon's analysis showed the ""damage"" was actually just a passing cloud casting a shadow on the runway.A blurry, low-quality image of Srinagar airport's civilian apron was circulated as proof of a Pakistani strike. But high-resolution satellite photos from multiple dates showed no damage whatsoever. The image was either misread or intentionally tampered with.Adding an international twist, Pakistan also released imagery from a Chinese satellite company to ""prove"" another hit on Adampur. The supposed ""damage"" turned out to be a mark that had existed for months, visible in older satellite captures as well.In yet another instance, visuals claiming to show bomb damage at Jammu airport were widely shared. The ""blackened spots"" near the runway were proven false after high-resolution post-strike satellite photos showed a completely intact airbase. The original image had been digitally altered.Across all claims, Pakistan has failed to demonstrate any actual damage to Indian airbases or assets in the wake of its attempted retaliation. In contrast, Indian airstrikes on Pakistani military sites, particularly Jacobabad and Bholari, have been more successful.""Recent imagery from Bholari Airbase, Pakistan indicates that the hangar damaged in the Indian airstrike is now covered with tarpaulin possibly signaling repair activity/restoration is now underway,"" Damien Symon wrote in a post on X.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Adampur airbase shortly after Operation Sindoor only reinforced the absence of any significant damage on Indian soil, a direct counter to the Pakistani narrative.","Pakistan has been using doctored satellite images, fake visuals, and misinformation campaigns.

Philippines now visa-free for Indian tourists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-now-visa-free-for-indian-tourists/articleshow/121709046.cms,"Philippines now visa-free for Indian tourists

NEW DELHI: Philippines has joined the increasing ranks of countries that have become visa-free for Indian tourists from Sunday. Post-Covid, several places have gone either visa-free or visa-on-arrival to attract the high-spending desi tourists. These include Thailand, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka (free electronic visa), Seychelles, Maldives, Philippines, Indonesia (visa on arrival) and Hong Kong (online pre-clearance required), according to Travel Agents Federation of India VP Anil Kalsi.“Indian nationals may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible and non-convertible period of 14 days for tourism purposes, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, confirmed hotel accommodation/ booking, proof of financial capacity, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” according to the website of the embassy of the Philippines in New Delhi. The reason for this change is also stated clearly: “enhancing tourism arrivals from India.”“Indian nationals holding valid and current American, Japanese, Australian, Canadian, Schengen, Singapore or United Kingdom (AJACSSUK) visas or residence permits may enter the Philippines without a visa for a non-extendible period of 30 days for tourism, upon presenting a passport valid for at least six months beyond the contemplated stay, and return or onward ticket to the next country of destination,” it adds.These updated visa-free privileges for Indian nationals can be availed of at any Philippine port of entry, and are not convertible to a visa-based stay or other admission status categories. Indian nationals must also not have any derogatory record with the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in order to be admitted into the country without a visa.“Indian nationals transiting in the Philippines or entering the country for long-term visits and non-tourism activities are required to apply for an appropriate Philippine visa at a Philippine Embassy or Consulate in their country or origin, place of legal residence, or any country that requires entry visas for Indian nationals. Indian nationals who are eligible for e-Visas may also apply through the official Philippine e-Visa website evisa.gov.ph . The DFA reminds that e-Visas may not be extended or converted to other visa-based stay or other admission status categories,” the embassy says.India has seen a spurt in outbound travel post-Covid by its nationals, while foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) to the country are yet to return to 2019 levels. In 2024, India is provisionally estimated to have received about 97 lakh FTAs, about 1.4% more than the previous year. India had crossed the 1-crore FTA mark for the first time in 2017 and had peaked at 1.1 crore in 2019.On the other hand, more Indians are travelling to foreign shores than they did in pre-Covid times. Barring the West, other countries — especially in Southeast Asia — are going all out to woo the high-spending desi globetrotters by majorly simplifying visas to boost their economies. The travel industry in India is requesting Govt to take steps to help boost inbound numbers that will create much-needed jobs and earn forex.","Philippines now visa-free for indian tourists from sunday.

Cash haul row: Justice Yashwant Varma left with only one option - how can he avoid impeachment?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cash-haul-row-justice-yashwant-varma-left-with-only-one-option-how-can-he-avoid-impeachment/articleshow/121705668.cms,"File photo: Justice Yashwant Varma (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court faces the prospect of impeachment in the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament after being indicted in a high-profile corruption case.According to officials cited by news agency PTI, resignation remains his only option to avoid a Parliamentary motion for removal, which, if passed, would strip him of pension and retirement benefits.Justice Varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his Delhi residence in March led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash in the outhouse. Though he denied knowledge of the money, a Supreme Court-appointed in-house panel, led by then Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, found him culpable after recording witness statements and Varma’s own deposition.Based on this report, Justice Khanna urged the President and Prime Minister to initiate his removal, PTI reported.As per Article 217 of the Constitution, a High Court judge may resign by writing to the President.The resignation becomes valid without requiring formal acceptance. If a judge resigns, they retain post-retirement entitlements. However, if removed by Parliament, they lose all such benefits.In Parliament, a motion for removal must be supported by at least 50 Rajya Sabha or 100 Lok Sabha members. Once admitted, the Judges (Inquiry) Act of 1968 mandates a fresh three-member committee, including a Supreme Court judge, a High Court chief justice, and a distinguished jurist, to investigate the charges.However, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju pointed out that the case is “slightly different” because an in-house committee has already concluded its probe. “It cannot be brushed aside,” Rijiju was quoted as saying by PTI, adding that reconciling the existing report with the statutory inquiry process will be a matter for the Speaker or Chairman to decide.Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, while meeting members of the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association, expressed dismay over the lack of a criminal investigation into the matter. “A very painful incident happened... There was a cash haul, obviously tainted, unaccounted and illegal,” he said.Dhankhar criticised the judiciary’s internal mechanism for shielding its members from FIRs, saying, “Unless permission is accorded by a functionary at the highest level in the judiciary, an FIR can’t be registered.”Justice Varma has since been transferred to the Allahabad High Court, where he has not been allotted any judicial duties. Rijiju has begun consultations with political parties to build consensus on the motion, which could be the first impeachment to be taken up in the new Parliament building.The Monsoon session of Parliament is scheduled from July 21 to August 12.","Justice yashwant varma came under scrutiny after a fire at his delhi residence in march led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of unaccounted cash.

Canada ‘Snubs Pakistan’, Defends G7 Invite To Indian PM; Khalistan Extremists Panic, Carney Says…

Poll Should countries deepen strategic partnerships with emerging global economies? Yes, it strengthens global cooperation. No, focus should remain on traditional alliances.

There was a strong push from the other G7 countries to have India at the table, Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, said after Prime Minister Narendra Modi received invitation from his Canadian counterpart and current G7 chair, Mark Carney, for the summit.In an interview on CBC NN, Nadjibulla said that Canada is the outlier because the other six members of the G7 are interested in deepening their strategic partnerships with India.When asked abut Carney's decision to invite PM Modi to the G7 Summit , she said, ""In terms of the G7, we are the outlier because the other six members of the G7 are interested in deepening their strategic partnerships with India, deepening their defense technology and economic ties. In fact, every day there is a new announcement about either France or UK Or US doing more with India.""""So having India there also matters to everybody else. I think there was a strong push from other G6 to have India at the table. And I think in order for Canada also to be able to show relevance on the world stage, we can just engage in diplomacy with those whom we like. I mean, this is not diplomacy is not a gift to our friends. It's not a concession.It's a necessary tool to be able to advance our interests and defend our values, right?"" she added.The statement came after the Canadian PM sent the invitation to PM Modi for the G7 Summit, which the latter accepted.When asked abut the reason behind inviting PM Modi, given the history of sour ties between the two nations over the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil, Carney highlighted India's economic prowess and said that it ""made sense"" to have the fifth largest economy at the table.Also read: 'Supremacist and racist mentality': Iran slams US travel ban; cites 'deep hostility towards Muslims' ""There are certain countries that should be at the table for those discussions and in my capacity as G7 chair consultation with others some others make those determinations.

And in addition, bilaterally, we have now agreed importantly to continued law enforcement to law enforcement dialogue so there's been some progress on that recognizes issues of accountability.

NEW DELHI: On his return to India after being a part of a global delegation that visited several countries, veteran Congress functionary Salman Khurshid said though he had been asked by his party to be a part of Centre's global outreach against terrorism, he was left wondering ""why people were making speculations and what they were looking for"". He was explaining his biting remarks that were apparently directed at Congress officebearers who ran down the govt campaign.Khurshid termed the trip as successful after his delegation met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar for a briefing. Congress MP Manish Tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in Gulf and African countries, where it effectively ""busted false equivalence"" Pakistan has drawn between Palestine and Kashmir, and sensitised the hosts about Pakistan's terror agenda against India.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is leading a delegation that is in the US at present, said, ""I think anybody who thinks that working in national interest is some sort of anti-party activity really needs to question themselves rather than us.""However, unfazed by the criticism of these party members, Congress continued its offensive against the programme, saying the foreign visits achieved little with the delegations failing to meet big leaders in host countries.When asked about Khurshid's praise of the outreach, All India Congress Committee spokesman Ajoy Kumar said the issue was not about any party or individual because it is govt that decides the script for any such delegation. ""And the problem is that govt did not give the script,"" he felt.Kumar added that the delegations did not even name China as the force behind Pakistan's devious agenda or call out US president Donald Trump for his claim that he was behind Indo-Pak ceasefire. ""The media was busy pitting Congress against Congress by talking about Tharoor, etc, but this was Modi's surrender,"" he claimed.Nevertheless, Khurshid stuck to his guns and said he had been in touch with the party high command throughout the tour.Citing an example of what the trip had achieved, he said Pakistan had to issue a ""frustrated press release"" after his delegation's three-day visit to Malaysia.""While some questions were raised by Malaysia, given its strong membership of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, we received a firm letter of support from the prime minister of Malaysia. We saw no indication of any hesitation in backing India,"" Khurshid pointed out.",Congress mp manish tewari too praised his delegation's efforts in gulf and african countries.

From college star to NFL underdog: Shedeur Sanders’ steep fall surprises fans and analysts

Lavish lifestyle clashes with underwhelming depth chart status





Once touted as a surefire first-round pick, Shedeur Sanders now finds himself fighting for relevance on the Cleveland Browns roster. Despite an impressive college resume and an enormous social media following, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders is sitting as the fourth-string quarterback heading into the 2025 season—and critics are not holding back.Sanders’ fall in the NFL Draft shocked fans and analysts alike. He was projected to go shortly after Cam Ward but was ultimately passed over by 31 teams. Even the Browns, who eventually picked him in the fifth round, chose Oregon Ducks QB Dillon Gabriel two rounds earlier—making it clear Shedeur wasn’t the first choice, even within his own team.Now, he's competing in a crowded quarterback room that includes seasoned veterans Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett, along with fellow rookie Gabriel. According to team sources, the frontrunner for QB1 is Flacco, who led the Browns to the playoffs in 2023. Meanwhile, Sanders remains on the sidelines, raising questions about whether he can live up to the hype he once carried.Off the field, Sanders continues to make headlines—not always for the right reasons. Fox Sports analyst Jason McIntyre didn’t mince words, saying, “Despite all the hype around Shedeur, he's the only Browns quarterback not training with the first team.The guy's motto is 'Be Legendary.' He's throwing these extremely lavish NFL Draft parties. And he's fourth on the depth chart—without a doubt.""The criticism isn’t just about performance; it’s about perception. Many are questioning Sanders’ commitment and focus, especially when his off-field activities seem to overshadow his current on-field struggles.Sanders isn’t without credentials. He led all Big 12 quarterbacks in completion percentage (74%) and threw for over 4,100 yards with 37 touchdowns at Colorado. Those stats earned him national recognition, but they haven’t translated into a strong NFL start—at least not yet.Also Read: $750K gone!

Gabrielle Union talks about in-laws





In the house of Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union recently, something noteworthy happened. Often seen smiling in public, the couple had more to share. Gabrielle was frank about a personal struggle, whereas Dwyane had arranged a joyful day for their family. This event revealed that even well-known people face actual family problems. Still, what truly took place backstage?On Saturday, May 25, under the sunny Los Angeles sky, Dwyane Wade brought his family together for a meaningful afternoon. He hosted a low-key gathering at a private park near their home a quiet, intimate affair shared only with close friends and loved ones.Gabrielle Union attended the gathering with their children, Zaya Wade and little Kaavia James Union Wade. A few close relatives from both Gabrielle’s and Dwyane’s families were also present. Wade shared brief clips on his Instagram story with the caption, “Family is everything.”Everybody grinned and chuckled. Zaya helped Kaavia play with bubbles. Gabrielle and Dwyane were seated beneath a tent, savoring excellent cuisine and fresh beverages.The event occurred at a time when both Dwyane and Gabrielle had hectic schedules.Dwyane Wade, though, saw to it that they stopped to savor family. It was his method of maintaining tight ties.Only two days later, on May 27, Gabrielle Union sat down for a candid conversation on Glennon Doyle’s podcast We Can Do Hard Things.

'Riots, looters ... will be solved': Trump condemns California, LA authorities



Over 20 arrested in NYC as crowd attempts to block federal immigration raids





The Donald Trump administration stepped up to deal with the protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement raids that entered a volatile phase this weekend. The federal government took over the California national guard and deployed 2,000 soldiers.The move came after US President Donald Trump criticised California officials including governor Gavin Newsom and threatened federal action.ICE reported 118 arrests as part of operations that began Friday, including at a warehouse in the downtown fashion district. Authorities allege the employer used false documents for some workers. Demonstrators have accused ICE and other agencies of using excessive force and say their actions have sparked fear in immigrant communities.Trump ordered 2,000 National Guardsmen to be deployed to Los Angeles, according to his spokeswoman, as clashes with federal agents continued for a second night amid protests over immigration raids.""President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 national guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.California governor Gavin Newsom condemned the federal government’s move to take control of the California national guard and deploy 2,000 troops to Los Angeles.He said that the move was ""purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions"".""The federal government is moving to take over the California national guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers. That move is purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions. LA authorities are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment’s notice. We are in close coordination with the city and county, and there is currently no unmet need. The guard has been admirably serving LA throughout recovery. This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,"" he said in a post on X.Trump strongly criticised California governor Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass over the protests.“If governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can’t do their jobs… the federal government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!” Trump wrote.His statement came as federal officials including ICE acting director Todd Lyons and Trump border security adviser Tom Homan defended the enforcement efforts and announced plans to bring in National Guard forces. Homan claimed the move was necessary for public safety, saying, “We are making Los Angeles safer. Mayor Bass should be thanking us.”More than 20 people were also arrested in Lower Manhattan on Saturday after a crowd of nearly 150 protesters clashed with police and attempted to stop federal immigration raids.Protesters dragged metal barricades, traffic cones, and even pulled a dresser without drawers from a nearby dumpster, tossing them into the street to block a van. However, police swiftly cleared the obstacles.","Us president orders 2,000 national guardsmen to be deployed to los angeles.
