From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years, increasing from 375 GW in Dec 2020 to almost 510 GW in the corresponding month of 2025.The growth has been driven largely by new and renewable energy — wind, solar, bioenergy and small hydro — which expanded by 122% during the period, from 91.1 GW to 203.6 GW, an addition of 112 GW. Including hydro and nuclear power, non-fossil sources now account for 263 GW, or 51.6%, of the country’s total installed capacity. In comparison, the share of fossil fuelbased capacity — coal, lignite, gas and diesel — has increased by 5.6% since Dec 2020.The new and renewable energy ministry said India recorded its highest-ever annual green capacity addition in 2025, with 44.5 GW added till Nov 30, largely due to a surge in solar installations. Solar capacity alone rose by 35 GW during the year to 132.9 GW, while wind power added 5.8 GW, taking total capacity to 54 GW.Large hydro capacity increased from 45.8 GW to 50.4 GW over five years, while nuclear power capacity saw a marginal rise from 6.8 GW in 2020 to 8.8 GW in 2025. Officials said all installed capacity was grid-connected and generation-ready, with transmission systems planned and implemented in line with phased capacity additions.The passage of the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025, which allows the entry of private players into the previously restricted nuclear sector, is expected to boost nuclear capacity.","India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years.

EU carbon tax to hurt developing countries with extra costs: CSE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-carbon-tax-to-hurt-developing-countries-with-extra-costs-cse/articleshow/126330313.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: As the European Union’s carbon border tax comes into effect from January 1, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based think tank, Saturday warned that the move would shift the decarbonisation costs on to developing countries including India. It said decarbonisation is critically important, but should not be pushed through unilateral measures like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which is expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for EU nations by 2028 at the cost of the Global South.CBAM — carbon border tax — is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive goods (emission generated during production), like iron & steel, aluminium, cement and fertilisers, that are entering the 27 EU nations. It will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries and impact their trade.Noting its implication for India, the CSE’s analysis shows that CBAM could impose substantial cost pressures on steel and aluminium exports to the EU and it could face a price burden of around 25% — a shock that exporters are likely to absorb through price compression in order to remain competitive. This is the reason India and many other countries, including China and South Africa, have been resisting it for long.“By putting a carbon price at the border, CBAM changes how competitiveness is defined in global trade. But what it also does is shift the decarbonisation costs to developing countries, thus extending a familiar dynamic where developing countries adapt to rules set elsewhere, under conditions that structurally disadvantage them,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.“Decarbonisation in industry is both necessary and unavoidable. Developing countries will need to pursue decarbonisation to remain competitive. However, this transition can’t be driven through unilateral steps alone,” she said.",Carbon border adjustment mechanism (cbam) expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for eu nations by 2028.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Compared with the uae and saudi arabia, bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

Pakistan Backs China’s Claim That It Mediated In Conflict With India

Pak's belated assertion on conflict pause raises brows

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has endorsed Beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict that led to Op Sindoor.At a press briefing on Thursday, Pak Foreign Office spokesperson, Tahir Andrabi, said Chinese leaders were ""in constant touch"" with Pakistan's leadership and had also made ""certain contacts with the Indian leadership in those three, four days in May, 6th to 10th and maybe prior to that and after that""""So, I think those contacts, which were characterised by a very positive diplomatic exchanges, they did constitute in bringing down temperatures and trying to bring peace and security in the region. So, I'm sure that the Chinese characterisation of mediation is correct,"" he said.Islamabad's statement, the first-ever about Beijing's alleged role in brokering the pause in the four-day conflict with India, should raise eyebrows because of the lag and because it had so far given the credit for suspension of hostilities exclusively to US President Donald Trump.India had maintained that the military pause followed a request from Pakistan's DGMO to its Indian counterpart, and not the result of any third-party intervention. It dismissed Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi's claim that Beijing had mediated during the crisis.Andrabi said Pakistan shared China's assessment, calling the efforts ""diplomacy for peace, for prosperity, for security"" and that ""this has been the hallmark of a number of international efforts that went into resolving that conflict in those three-four fateful days"". Pakistan, he added, ""firmly"" supported China's position as stated by its foreign minister.China's claim mimics repeated assertions by US President Trump that Washington played a decisive role in ending the confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistan has endorsed beijing's claim that it played a mediating role in the may 2025 india-pakistan conflict that led to op sindoor.

"Despite backlash on use of Punjabi music, Babbulicious remains unfazed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-backlash-on-use-of-punjabi-music-babbulicious-remains-unfazed/articleshow/126329976.cms,"‘Surreal’: Babbulicious on making NYC groove



A subway station is an unlikely venue for a mayoral oath — and Punjabi pop an even more unlikely soundtrack. But when New York mayor Zohran Mamdani danced to the track ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ by Toronto-based artist Babbu aka Babbulicious at his inauguration, American politics met bhangra beats in a moment that instantly went viral.With Mamdani, his wife Rama Duwaji and hundreds in attendance joining in, the ceremony turned into an unexpected celebration of diasporic culture. For Babbulicious — the turbaned Sikh singer, who is also a comedian and designer, it was a powerful moment of visibility. “Zohran sang along, and the sight of (US senator) Bernie Sanders clapping and vibing to a Punjabi song was surreal,” he told TOI over email.Born Babbu Singh and raised in Toronto’s Brampton Punjabi belt, Babbulicious’s creative journey has been anything but conventional. He dropped out of art college at 19 and went on to build a career that spans influencer skits, visual art, puppet series, children’s books and charting music.“All my art, in one way or another, is about connecting with my younger self — creating things that would have made me feel seen, valued,” he says.Mamdani’s team discovered ‘Gaddi Red Challenger’ through social media. Singh later adapted lyrics to “New York vich munda renda”, reflecting the mayor’s multicultural identity.The celebratory moment also drew predictable backlash. Far-right voices criticised the use of non-Western music at a civic ceremony and misidentified the turbaned artist’s religion. Singh remains unfazed. “Sometimes it’s best not to engage. It’s hard to convince someone to change their bias, so the best thing is to smile and continue with your day,” he says.Much of Singh’s work deliberately challenges stereotypes around Sikh identity, often through humour, including his popular ‘Khalsa Uncle’ skits. Representation, he believes, is essential. He recalls the impact of seeing Indian American designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia in Wes Anderson films while growing up. “Seeing someone who looked like me meant everything. Funny enough, he was at the inauguration — we met for the first time, and I hugged him and told him how much that visibility mattered. It made me feel like we could be anything we wanted to be.”While rappers like Lil Wayne and Jay-Z have shaped his musical sensibility, Singh says artists who push creative boundaries while staying true to themselves resonate most deeply. “Outkast, the Beatles, Daft Punk, Ye have had a meaningful impact on me.”Today, Toronto’s diasporic energy is propelling Punjabi pop onto the global stage. Reflecting this shift, Toronto Metropolitan University is set to launch a course on Diljit Dosanjh this year, examining his influence on music, identity and the Punjabi diaspora. For Singh, his subway-station bhangra moment signals a wider cultural shift. “Punjabi music is ready for the mainstream,” he says.This story had continued from a page 1 story in the newspaper.

NEW DELHI: Hindu religious leaders and BJP figures have launched sharp attacks on Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan over his IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) selecting Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman , while the Congress has stepped in to defend the actor, calling the remarks against him an attack on India’s pluralism.The first public criticism came from Hindu spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur, who questioned KKR’s decision in the backdrop of reported violence against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh. Speaking to ANI, Thakur said the KKR management should remove the Bangladeshi player. He demanded that the money paid to the cricketer be given to families of Hindu victims as an apology.""The management of KKR, their boss, should remove that cricketer (Mustafizur Rahman). Rs 9.2 crore that they are giving to that cricketer, that money should be given as an apology to the relatives of the Hindu children if they are in India, so that at least they can know that their feelings are with the Hindus,"" Thakur said.Spiritual leader Jagadguru Swami Rambhadracharya went on to questioned Khan’s character and called hhim a traitor.""He (Shah Rukh Khan) is not a hero.

Som said Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.""The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan, I'm calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shah Rukh Khan that they will not succeed.

MP Manickam Tagore condemned the remarks against Khan, calling them an attack on India’s pluralism. In a post on X, Tagore said hatred could not define nationalism and criticised the RSS for spreading division.""Calling Superstar Shah Rukh Khan a 'traitor' is an attack on India's pluralism.

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise.

Patrick Mahomes welcomes 2026 focused on rehab as Chiefs shift from urgency to patience





The Kansas City Chiefs are closing out a season few in the locker room expected, and the unease has little to do with the standings. For the first time in years, the focus in Kansas City has shifted away from playoff math and toward patience. At the center of it all is Patrick Mahomes, whose recovery has quietly become the franchise’s most important storyline heading into 2026.While Andy Reid addressed the situation publicly, it was Brittany Mahomes who offered the most telling glimpse. A New Year’s Instagram post showed a joyful family moment, fireworks overhead, children close by. Yet one detail stood out. Patrick Mahomes was still on crutches, his knee wrapped in a heavy brace. The image said more than any official update. Rehab remains the priority, and the process is far from over.Patrick Mahomes suffered ACL and LCL tears late in Week 15 against the Chargers while pushing to keep the season alive. That single play reshaped the Chiefs’ winter. The expectation inside the organization is cautious optimism, with a hopeful return near Week 1. Until then, progress is measured in small, deliberate steps, not timelines.Reid confirmed Mahomes has stayed deeply involved, even if he will not travel with the team for the Week 18 finale. As the coach explained, “He’s around, so he’s in the building and working and doing his rehab, and spending a lot of hours doing it.” Reid added, “He’s really attacked that and will continue to do that. He’s around and sees the guys, but most of his time is being spent rehabbing.”Asked about Mahomes joining the team on the road, Reid shut that down quickly. “Probably not this soon, no,” he said.The decision reflects caution, not concern. Knee injuries demand discipline, and the Chiefs see no value in unnecessary strain. Rehab will stretch through the offseason, likely into training camp, with careful checkpoints along the way.For now, Mahomes enters 2026 grounded, surrounded by family, focused on recovery. The season may be ending, but belief in Kansas City remains firmly intact.Also Read: “Hate will not get us out”: Brittany Mahomes addresses hate and healing during emotionally charged moment off the field","Patrick mahomes is entering 2026 focused entirely on rehab after suffering acl and lcl tears.

Why are Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins emerging as trade market storylines?



Bruins URGED to make HUGE trade... Report reveals NEXT move | Boston Bruins News





The NHL rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around Vancouver Canucks trades involving Kiefer Sherwood and Elias Pettersson heats up, while the Boston Bruins are rumored to be inquiring about Matias Maccelli ahead of the March 6 trade day. With several clubs looking into the market from the start, these unfolding plots are rapidly capturing the attention of all the people around the league.It has been reported that both sides are quietly investigating the possibilities, and this information comes from Sportsnet, The Athletic, and The Province sources. A lot of names are thrown around, and the management is set to acquire the best ones. The rumor mill is very busy as the deadline is approaching.The Canucks' trade of Quinn Hughes to the Minnesota Wild not only surprised the league but also hinted that more such changes could be in the offing. Vancouver’s Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet has Kiefer Sherwood, the winger, as the potential trade candidate from the Canucks, while he also mentioned on The Fan Hockey Show that the San Jose Sharks might be interested in him. Vancouver seems to be receptive to the idea of trading off some of its players before the deadline, as there are multiple teams making calls.Harman Dayal of The Athletic mentioned that the Canucks have to act quickly on impending UFAs if they are to control their freewheeling forward group. This could lead to the trading of either Sherwood or Evander Kane.At the same time, Patrick Johnston from The Province reported that there are still talks regarding Elias Pettersson, notwithstanding his poor performance and $11.6 million cap hit. On the other hand, the Bruins are reportedly interested in Matias Maccelli, as per Fluto Shinzawa of The Athletic, who sees him as a potential offensive boost for Boston; however, NESN’s Victor Barbosa has warned that a trade with Toronto could be complicated due to the rivalry between the two teams.The Vancouver Canucks and Boston Bruins are still the teams to monitor with the approaching trade deadline. The unfolding of these rumors into trades will be determined by several factors: timing, price, and playoff aspirations—but the talk around the league indicates that changes are to happen shortly. Trade discussions remain fluid as deadline pressure builds.Also Read: Top NHL suspensions and fines of 2025: Mathew Barzal, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, and others disciplined","The nhl rumor roundup is getting hotter as the speculation around vancouver canucks trades involving kiefer sherwood and elias pettersson heats up.

Charlie Kirk's Old Nicki Minaj Comments Resurface After His Widow Erika Shares Stage With Rapper

Brian Harpole, Candace Owens, and the video that sparked online debate





A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event. The clip shows Brian Harpole, who was part of Kirk’s security team, standing in the crowd shortly before the shooting. The video began spreading on X in late December 2025 and quickly caught public attention. Many people online are now asking questions about what happened just before the attack. Some users are urging Candace Owens to look into the footage. At the same time, police have been clear. They say Tyler Robinson is the only suspect in custody, and no official report has linked Harpole to the killing.The shooting took place at Utah Valley University on 10 September 2025 during a Turning Point USA event. While the video has raised debate online, authorities say the investigation has not changed.The video at the center of the discussion is made up of short clips from the event. In the footage, a man believed by some X users to be Brian Harpole is seen standing among attendees. His arms are folded, and one hand is partly hidden. Some viewers say this looks strange. Others say the clip shows nothing unusual and no sign of a weapon or violent act.The video gained attention after it was posted by Blake Bednarz on 29 December 2025. Bednarz wrote that the man in the video “had his folded arms with right hand hidden under his armpit when he squeezed.” Other users pushed back right away. They said the clip lacks clear context and does not prove anything.As the clip spread, several users asked Candace Owens to review it. One user, Katie Ash, wrote on 30 December 2025, “I have been screaming this since Candace and Erika’s meeting!” Another account said the video looked important but asked how such claims could be proven. Some reactions were emotional, with users saying the situation was upsetting, while others questioned how the event was handled.Candace Owens had already mentioned Harpole on her podcast on 9 December 2025. She said, “I received SHOCKING information which puts Charlie Kirk’s last trip to Asia in a new light. And it involves his security detail, Brian Harpole.” Candace Owens added that the claim came from a man in witness protection. She did not share documents or proof. Police have not confirmed her claim and continue to say Robinson is the only suspect.Brian Harpole is a former Texas police officer with 14 years of experience. He later started Integrity Security Solutions. In November 2025, he appeared on The Shawn Ryan Show and spoke about security planning. He said about the venue choice, “That’s where they told us to have it.” No evidence has tied him to the shooting.Also Read: Candace Owens Highlights New Claims Raising Serious Questions After Eyewitness Mitch Snow Shares Details On Charlie Kirk Death Timeline","Charlie kirk killing video raises new questions as brian harpole footage spreads and candace owens is urged to respond.

Caolan Robertson raises doubts over Nick Shirley’s reporting style and Minnesota fraud claims







Nick Shirley’s viral Minnesota daycare video is now facing fresh questions after Irish journalist Caolan Robertson said Shirley once told him his work was “satire,” not real journalism. The claim comes as Shirley’s recent fraud allegations continue to spread online and gain attention from high-profile figures.Shirley’s Minnesota video, posted in mid-December, suggested daycare centers were empty while receiving public funds. The clip went viral and was even retweeted by JD Vance on December 28. In his post, Vance praised Shirley’s work and called it “far more useful” than the 2024 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting.But Robertson says Shirley’s past actions raise serious doubts. Robertson, who previously interviewed Shirley in Ukraine, says Shirley made videos suggesting there was no war happening there. When confronted in Kyiv, Robertson claims Shirley admitted his work was not journalism.“When I confronted Nick about what he did here in Kyiv, he said what he was doing wasn’t journalism, it was satire, and his entire reporting started to fall apart,” Robertson said.Robertson shared a clip from their interview to support his claim. He also said people who guided Shirley in Kyiv later told him Shirley was shown bombed locations, including a children’s hospital, but chose not to show them in his videos.Robertson believes Shirley follows the same pattern wherever he goes. He says Shirley films a small area, makes big claims, and then moves on without showing full facts.“Nick has a very specific talent. He shows up somewhere, films a couple of streets, announces he’s cracked the whole story. No data, no depth. Just vibes,” Robertson said. “Then we jump to Minneapolis. It’s the same tactic — drop in, film selectively, inflame, provoke, declare victory, go viral.”One location featured in Shirley’s Minnesota video was ABC Learning Center in Minneapolis. Shirley suggested the daycare was empty. But when CBS News visited the center later in December, reporters found more than a dozen children inside, along with several staff members.Director Ahmed Hasan told CBS News the children were working on math and basic language skills. His wife, Umi Hasan, who helps run the center, said she believes Shirley’s video was politically motivated.“We pay our taxes. We do whatever we can to be a law-abiding citizen. When one Somali does something wrong, we all get collective punishment,” Umi Hasan said.Ahmed Hasan also said the center received constant phone calls from people outside Minnesota after the video went viral, adding to stress for staff and families.Also Read: Who Is Nick Shirley?

Paul Skenes embraces a new look heading into 2026

Livvy Dunne’s playful response wins over fans

“baby face cutieeee”.





One of baseball’s brightest young stars, Paul Skenes, unveiled a new year look, and his girlfriend was among the first to react. In her TikTok posted on January 1, Livvy Dunne said she was filming her first reaction to boyfriend Paul Skenes being beardless, in a trick that immediately made fans sit up and take notice. Taking inspiration from this viral sound, the video opted to go for laughs, pairing the footage with the catchphrase ""Oh my goodness! She’s bald!”, and Dunne chronicled this unexpected change.The Pittsburgh Pirates ace, who is currently 23 years old, abandoned his former signature mustache at the start of the 2026 season, replacing the now-familiar look with a much cleaner face and the extremely well-groomed features that his fans immediately linked to his burgeoning career in Major League Baseball. Amidst this non-story, Dunne's witty response soon turned into part of the dialogue of that pop-culture moment in an otherwise quiet offseason update.Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes has been in the news cycle much of the last two years, both for his nasty, nasty mound games but also for his one-of-a-kind stache. Those whiskers got so much more visible when he went from college stud to MLB star, which made his shorn face that much more noticeable.The clean-shaven look, despite being cosmetic, signals a new chapter as he prepares for the 2026 campaign. Twitter users were quick to respond, many agreeing with Dunne that Skenes is just as good as ""baby face"" Skenes. Despite seeing nothing to indicate that the switch to No. 24 was more than a personal choice, it nevertheless confirms a good degree of offseason buzz.Dunne captured her approval in just a few words, writing alongside the video:The former LSU gymnast who has turned into one of the biggest names in sports social media for mixing humor with a bit of her personal life, as this post fell directly in line with.The pair, who went public with their romance in 2023, is no stranger to people talking when their worlds collide online. Fans loved the relatable response, as well as the couple's effortless chemistry, in this latest moment, too. And with Skenes setting up for yet another season filled with ample media opportunities and Dunne branching her brand outside of gymnastics, even such mundane activities as shaving a mustache are enough to hold the gaze of the fans watching so intently.Also Read: How tall is Fernando Tatis Jr?

Who is Christian Sturdivant? ISIS-inspired teen captured by FBI before he could pull off 'terrorist attack' in North Carolina on New Year’s Eve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-christian-sturdivant-isis-inspired-teen-captured-by-fbi-before-he-could-pull-off-a-terrorist-attack-in-north-carolina-on-new-years-eve/articleshow/126311946.cms,"



An 18-year-old from Mint Hill, North Carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly New Year’s Eve attack in support of the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham, before FBI agents moved in to stop him.The suspect was identified as Christian Sturdivant, who planned to stab civilians at public locations using knives, firearms and hammers, with the aim of killing as many people as possible.Sturdivant was arrested on December 31, 2025, and has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. The criminal complaint was unsealed after he appeared in federal court in Charlotte. He remains in custody.Officials said the alleged plot targeted a grocery store and a fast food restaurant and was in its final stages. Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “This successful collaboration between federal and local law enforcement saved American lives from a horrific terrorist attack on New Year’s Eve.”According to court documents, the FBI became aware of Sturdivant on December 18, 2025, after receiving information about social media posts in which he praised ISIS , a designated terrorist organisation by many countries. Earlier that month, he allegedly shared an image mocking Christianity, accompanied by hateful language similar to ISIS propaganda calling for violence against non-believers.According to the FBI, Sturdivant began communicating online with an undercover federal agent posing as an ISIS supporter. During those conversations, Sturdivant allegedly said, “I will do jihad soon,” and referred to himself as “a soldier of the state,” a phrase linked to ISIS.On December 14, he sent the federal agent an image showing two hammers and a knife. Prosecutors say the image was similar to ISIS propaganda encouraging knife attacks in Western countries. On December 19, he allegedly sent a voice recording pledging loyalty to ISIS.FBI Director Kash Patel said, “The accused allegedly wanted to be a soldier for ISIS and made plans to commit a violent attack on New Year’s Eve in support of that terrorist group, but the FBI and our partners put a stop to that.”A search of Sturdivant’s home on December 29 uncovered handwritten notes, including one titled “New Years Attack 2026”. Prosecutors say the document listed equipment such as a vest, mask, tactical gloves and knives, and described a plan to stab up to 20 or 21 civilians. The note also includes a so-called “martyrdom op” in which Sturdivant intended to attack police responding to the scene so he would die as a martyr.John A. Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, said, “As alleged, Sturdivant aspired to become a ‘martyr’ for ISIS and was in the final stages of planning a mass-casualty attack on New Year’s Eve.”The FBI said they found two butcher knives and two hammers hidden under Sturdivant’s bed, along with a list of targets and tactical gear. Investigators believe these items matched those shown in messages sent to the undercover contact.If convicted, Sturdivant faces up to 20 years in federal prison. Prosecutors said that the charges remain allegations and that he is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court.","Christian sturdivant, 18, from mint hill, north carolina, is accused of plotting a deadly new year’s eve attack in support of the islamic state in iraq and al-sham.

The Trump administration was exploring the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans in Minnesota who engaged in fraud, a move that would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News, one day after the US Department of Health and Human Services froze childcare payments to Minnesota following what the agency said was fraud at daycares in the state.""We're also not afraid to use denaturalization,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a tool at the president and the secretary of state's disposal, and it's one this administration has previously used before.""""Absolutely,"" Leavitt said when asked whether Trump wanted Somali-Americans' citizenship revoked if they were convicted of fraud. “It’s something the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is currently looking at right now.""Federal prosecutors charged 86 individuals with felonies for exploiting federal tax dollars intended to help hungry children during the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.More than 60 pleaded guilty or were convicted so far. The case was originally brought by the Biden administration, US Today reported.Of the 86 people charged in a sprawling $250 million case involving Minnesota-administered programmes, 78 were identified as Somali-Americans. Minnesota was home to about 80,000 Somali immigrants, the largest of any state. Most were naturalised citizens, foreign-born individuals who went through a legal process to gain their citizenship.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a December 30 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast, said DHS investigators were currently going ""door to door"" to suspected fraud sites in Minnesota ""to make sure we follow the money here and we bring arrests, prosecutions and ultimately removals.""The White House also seized on a recent viral video from conservative influencer Nick Shirley that claimed abandoned daycare centres were receiving millions in state taxpayer dollars. FBI Director Kash Patel on Dec. 28 said his agency had ""surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.""Stripping citizenship from naturalised US citizens was rare and had a high bar. Federal courts, not the administration, made the final decisions. Denaturalisation could be pursued through either civil proceedings or a criminal conviction.During President Donald Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department filed 168 denaturalisation cases in federal court, while the Biden administration filed 64 such cases, a database created by Irina Mantra, a Hofstra University law professor, found. An average of 11 denaturalisation cases per year were filed between 1990 and 2007.The general grounds for denaturalisation involved the ""illegal procurement of naturalization"" or the ""concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation,"" according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a federal agency. In addition, the federal govt could cite an individual's current or past affiliation with a totalitarian political party or terrorist organisation.Demonstrators rallied in protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid a reported federal immigration operation targeting the Somali community, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, December 8, 2025.Trump called Somali immigrants in Minnesota ""garbage,"" igniting pushback from immigrant rights advocates who argued the White House's focus on the Minnesota fraud case was an excuse to target the immigrant population. Trump and Republicans blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, for allowing the fraud to unfold.Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, a close ally of Trump, called for the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans convicted of fraud in a Dec. 30 post on Facebook.“I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home. If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter,"" Emmer said.",White house press secretary karoline leavitt discussed the potential action in a december 31 appearance on fox news.

The first video of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arriving in the United States was released on Saturday (local time), showing him handcuffed and escorted by US officials as he stepped off a helicopter at New York’s Stewart Airport.Hours earlier, Maduro was captured by US forces during a late-night operation in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump had also shared the first image of Maduro in custody, showing him handcuffed and blindfolded aboard a US warship.After landing in New York, a motorcade believed to be carrying Maduro exited the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters on Manhattan’s West Side Highway before briefly heading north and then returning to a heliport, according to BBC.Officials said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were flown by helicopter to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Three helicopters were seen travelling down the Hudson River, passing the Statue of Liberty, before landing. From there, the couple were transported to the detention facility in a convoy of law enforcement vehicles.According to US authorities, Maduro was arrested in Venezuela and flown out of the capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday aboard a US helicopter.He was first taken to the USS Iwo Jima at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean Sea.From there, he was flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, before being transferred to another aircraft that took him to Stewart Air Force Base in New York State’s Orange County. He was then flown by helicopter into New York City.In total, Maduro travelled about 2,100 miles (3,300 kilometres) from his capture in Venezuela to his arrival in the United States.Also read: Nicolas Maduro captured; w​ho is in charge of Venezuela now?

This includes taking fingerprints, biometric data and mugshots, along with medical examinations. Their details will then be entered into the US Customs and Border Protection system.Maduro and his wife are expected to be formally produced in court, possibly as early as Monday.Earlier, Trump had shared the first image of Maduro following his capture, posting a photograph of the Venezuelan leader aboard the USS Iwo Jima. “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Speaking later on Fox and Friends Weekend, Trump said Maduro and Flores were seized during a night-time operation and flown directly to a US warship. He claimed Maduro had been heavily guarded inside a fortified palace and that US forces had rehearsed the operation in advance.The operation reportedly lasted less than 30 minutes and took place amid explosions in Caracas and other locations. Venezuela’s government condemned the action as a “serious military aggression” and declared a state of emergency, while the US said its forces suffered minimal casualties. Maduro now remains in US custody as legal proceedings move forward in New York.The White House’s official Rapid Response account later posted a video showing what appeared to be a “perp walk” of the ousted Venezuelan leader at the DEA office in Manhattan.The video showed Maduro wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and walking handcuffed alongside DEA agents down a blue-carpeted hallway marked “DEA NYD,” according to CNN.The footage showed Maduro being processed and fingerprinted at the DEA office. As he walked with agents, Maduro appeared to attempt speaking in English.“Good night,” he said, before correcting himself in Spanish: “Es buenas noches, no?” — meaning, “That is good night, no?”He then repeated “good night” to those present and added, “Happy New Year”.","First video of venezuelan president nicolás maduro arriving in the united states was released on saturday.
