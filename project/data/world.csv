Operation Sindoor vs Balakot: India raises the stakes with deep strikes in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-pahalgam-avenged-india-strikes-terror-camp-in-pakistan-pok/articleshow/120948721.cms,"Out of the nine targets chosen by India, four were in Pakistan and the remaining five were in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Why it matters: A quantum leap from Balakot

Hit more targets (nine vs one in Balakot)

Penetrated deeper into Pakistani territory (striking Bahawalpur and Muridke), and

Employed sophisticated precision munitions, including loitering drones.

Security analyst Aadil Mir told ANI: “India has crossed two significant thresholds… striking multiple sites and targeting Pakistan’s heartland. This goes far beyond 2019.”

Zoom in: The strikes and what they hit

Execution & technology:

The strikes were carried out entirely from Indian airspace using a mix of:

Loitering munitions (which hover before attacking),

Precision-guided missiles, and

Air Force, Navy, and Army strike coordination.

Targets included:

Markaz Subhan Allah (Bahawalpur) - JeM HQ

Markaz Taiba (Muridke) - LeT’s main base

Syedna Bilal & Shwawai Nalla camps (Muzaffarabad) - JeM & LeT hubs

Makaz Raheel Shahid & Mehmoona Joya (Kotli & Sialkot) - Hizbul Mujahideen sites

Other logistical, training and recruitment centers in Barnala and Tehra Kalan

Indian military sources confirmed the intent was to “decapitate” leadership and logistics across JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure.

The symbolism

Sindoor

What they're saying

Following Operation Sindoor, the Indian Army said on 'X': ""Justice is Served.""

Defence ministry: “Focused, measured, and non-escalatory… no Pakistani military sites were targeted.”

Defence minister Rajnath Singh: “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.”

Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria (Retd): “Nine terrorist sites and their infrastructure were targeted… A fitting response under PM Modi’s direction to inflict unimaginable punishment.”

US President Donald Trump said at an unrelated White House interaction with news reporters: “We just heard about it as we were walking through the doors of the Oval ... They've been fighting for a long time. ... I just hope it ends very quickly.”

Between the lines: This was not Balakot 2.0 - it’s a new doctrine

More importantly, Sindoor introduced:

Wider spatial escalation - hitting targets near Lahore (Muridke) and Sialkot.

Higher operational tempo - All nine strikes occurred within minutes.

Zero intrusion strategy - India used standoff weapons, minimizing airspace breach and escalation risk.

The big picture: Why now, and what changed?

What’s next: Escalation or deterrence?

Ceasefire violations:

India’s stance:

The takeaway: A new red line has been drawn

Operation Sindoor

Raised the cost of cross-border terrorism,

Expanded its military playbook, and

Sent a clear message: No more sanctuaries, even in Pakistan’s heartland.

India also showed its restraint and maturity by not hitting military targets, avoiding a full-scale escalation - even as it delivered a strategic blow to terror infrastructure.

As Brigadier Hemant Mahajan (Retd) put it:

""This was a world-class, precision strike. The Armed Forces must be complimented. We hit them when they least expected it - and hit them hard.""

In a bold and coordinated military action, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor - a high-precision missile strike targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 25 Indian civilians and a Nepali national just two weeks earlier.The targets included JeM's Bahawalpur HQ, LeT’s base in Muridke, and several key infrastructure hubs of Hizbul Mujahideen, marking India’s most comprehensive cross-border military strike in over 50 years.India's previous cross-border strikes - the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes - were relatively limited in scope and geography. In contrast, Operation Sindoor:The operation's name,, is derived from the red vermillion Hindu women wear to signify marriage — a nod to the Pahalgam widows, including one whose Navy officer husband was gunned down in front of her.While both Balakot and Sindoor were retaliatory anti-terror operations:Balakot (2019): Targeted a single JeM training camp in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Sindoor (2025): Targeted multiple, geographically dispersed terror sites, including deep inside Pakistan’s Punjab.The Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 - where civilians, including security families, were massacred - generated national outrage and international concern.PM Narendra Modi, in an April 29 security briefing, gave the armed forces ""complete operational freedom"". This green greenlight, combined with high-quality intelligence and technological advances, led to the execution of a strike unprecedented since the 1971 war.India then moved swiftly to brief world powers, including the US, UK, Russia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, explaining the non-escalatory nature of the operation.NSA Ajit Doval spoke directly to US NSA and secretary of state Marco Rubio, laying out evidence of Pakistan-based terror links to Pahalgam.Hours after the strikes, Pakistan’s army opened artillery fire along the LoC in Jammu’s Bhimber Gali area, killing three Indian civilians. India’s army said it was responding in a “calibrated manner.”New Delhi is projecting this as a deterrence-by-punishment strategy - precise, contained, and legally justified. “We only hit known terror camps,” the Indian embassy in New York emphasized.With, India has:(With inputs from agencies)","Operation sindoor targeted nine terror camps deep inside pakistan and pakistan-occupied kashmir (pok) indian military sources confirmed the intent was to “decapitate” leadership and logistics across jem, let, and hizbul mujahideen infrastructure.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday carried out "" Operation Sindoor "" in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), striking terror bases in retaliation for the Pahalgam terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians.During the operation, the forces deployed loitering munitions to destroy nine terror camps across Pakistan and PoK.Precision strike weapon systems from the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, including loitering munitions, were employed in Operation Sindoor, which successfully targeted nine terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), sources confirmed news agency ANI.The coordinates for the attacks were provided by intelligence agencies, and the strikes were carried out entirely from Indian soil.The Indian forces selected these locations with the intent of targeting key Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba leadership, responsible for sponsoring terrorism in India, sources added.The operation targeted nine locations, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke. Utilising advanced precision weapons and intelligence-based targeting, the Army, Navy, and Air Force coordinated the strikes without engaging Pakistani military sites.A loitering munition is a type of precision weapon that hovers over a target area to locate and strike targets, often autonomously or under human control, before being expended.As per a statement issued by the defence ministry at 1:44 am the operation was described as ""focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.""The targets included the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) headquarters in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba's (LeT) base in Muridke.After the operation, Indian Army said: ""Justice is Served.

CD volunteers in the field will guide people on response to varied situations.""Union home secretary Govind Mohan on Tuesday held a meeting with state chief secretaries and UT administrators to discuss the CD drill, which will simulate war-like scenarios in the 244 CD districts, amid talk of an impending retaliation against Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack.The chief secretaries were told to activate DMs - who double up as coordinators for civil defence - and ensure that 'wardens' are appointed for different 'grids' or functions, systems upgraded to respond to exigencies, including war, and CD volunteers enrolled and trained to guide citizens to achieve goals like saving lives, minimising damage to property, maintaining continuity of production, and keeping public morale high in the face of hostile actions.""As of now, each of the 244 CD districts or towns, are at different levels of preparedness. The CD exercise on Wednesday will help the Union home ministry learn to what extent states/UTs have created this set-up or are utilising it, how trained and prepared staff/volunteers are and what more needs to be done to help them attain a uniform level of preparedness,"" the official said.In the drill, when the IAF hotline with DMs communicate an air-raid warning, a siren would be sounded by the DM. The siren would be different for an approaching 'enemy' aircraft, an overhead aircraft, and after they have left. Where there are critical facilities like hospitals, volunteers will tell the public that windows may be 'blackened' with paper or cloth etc; where not, a power cut may be effected.The drill in each civil defence district or town will be different depending on its vulnerability.

An IED blast carried out by Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) targeting a Pakistan army convoy in MachKachhi district on Monday killed at least eight soldiers, including a special operations commander, and injured six others.BLA said its freedom fighters targeted the army convoy using a remote-controlled device. The blast destroyed the enemy vehicle, killing multiple personnel, it said. The Pakistan armed force’s media and public relations wing, ISPR, alleged India’s involvement in the attack, a claim that has become a recurring narrative in such incidents. “Terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy, so called Baloch Liberation Army, targeted security forces’ vehicles with an improvised explosive device in the general area Mach-Kachhi district.

The army vehicle was hit between the Amir Post and the Ali Khan base in the Gestri area, according to local enforcement officers.The attack is the latest in a series of strikes against the Pakistan army in Balochistan, highlighting the ongoing tensions in the region.Three days ago, BLA attacked a prison van by blocking a key highway.

Here's what we know so far:

The Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday, targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan.

The operation was carried out in response to the recent Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen.

A total of nine terrorist infrastructure sites were hit during the operation, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The strikes focused on areas from where attacks against India were reportedly being planned and directed.

The MoD clarified that the operation was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.

The government reaffirmed its commitment to holding those responsible for the Pahalgam attack accountable.

A detailed briefing on Operation Sindoor is scheduled to take place later today.

In a post on X, the Indian Army said, “Justice is served. Jai Hind!”

Pakistan violated the Ceasefire Agreement by firing artillery in Bhimber Gali, located in the Poonch-Rajouri area of Jammu and Kashmir, hours after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh publicly expressed national pride following Operation Sindoor, declaring ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" in support of the armed forces.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath voiced support for the military by posting ""Jai Hind! Jai Hind Ki Sena!"" on social media.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal also backed the strikes, sharing “Bharat Mata Ki Jai #OperationSindoor” in a post online.

US President Donald Trump said he had just been informed about India’s Operation Sindoor as he entered the Oval Office, calling the situation ""a shame"".

Trump remarked that ""people knew something was going to happen,"" suggesting the strike was anticipated due to past tensions.

He commented on the historical India-Pakistan conflict, saying they’ve been fighting “for centuries” and added, “I hope it ends very quickly.”

Poll Do you agree with the Indian ambassador's criticism of The Irish Times editorial regarding the Pahalgam terror attack? No, I think the editorial was justified. Yes, I support the ambassador's stance.

NEW DELHI: Indian ambassador to Ireland Akhilesh Mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to The Irish Times over its editorial on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, accusing the publication of downplaying terrorism and echoing narratives that provide ""cover fire"" to its perpetrators.In a post on X, Mishra condemned the editorial for failing to unequivocally denounce the terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in Jammu and Kashmir. Instead, he mentioned, it chose to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “rattling sabres,” and drew an equivalence between India and Pakistan, a country Mishra described as the ""global epicentre of terrorism.""“Our reply to a malicious Irish Times editorial on the terrorist attack in Pahalgam,” India envoy wrote. “Instead of condemning terror and sympathising with innocent victims, it provides cover fire for the terrorists and their sponsors by charging PM Modi of rattling sabres and equating India with Pakistan.”In a letter to the editor, Mishra called the editorial unprofessional and biased, stating that it stood in stark contrast to the support and solidarity expressed by Irish citizens and leaders, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin.He highlighted that while world leaders - including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen - and institutions like the UN Security Council had condemned the attack in the strongest terms, the editorial omitted these facts and instead questioned India’s response.“The UN Security Council... underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. The Irish Times failed to mention this main operative portion of the UN statement,” Mishra wrote.Refuting the editorial's portrayal of post-2019 Jammu and Kashmir, Indian ambassador Mishra specified that the region has seen major progress since the abrogation of Article 370, with rising investments, a tourism boom, and high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections.“Contrary to The Irish Times’ misperception… the people have witnessed unprecedented economic and infrastructural development… A democratic government was elected in 2024 with 63.9% turnout,” the letter said.Mishra also pointed to national unity in the aftermath of the attack, saying the entire country, including opposition parties and Kashmiri civil society, was firmly behind the Centre's resolve to act against the perpetrators.The Irish Times editorial, published on April 28, had stated that while Pakistan denied involvement and offered to cooperate with an international investigation, India had not presented evidence beyond historical claims. It accused PM Modi of ""rattling sabres"" and warned against escalation.In response to the April 22 attack, India has taken several strong steps, including suspending long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, in a firm response to Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism.","Indian ambassador to ireland akhilesh mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to the irish times over its editorial on the april 22 terror attack in pahalgam.
