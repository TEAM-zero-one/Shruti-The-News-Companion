NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to raise the Gaza issue during his Israel visit. She called on him to speak about the plight of civilians while addressing the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).Her remarks come as PM Modi departed for a two-day State visit to Israel from February 25–26 at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the trip, PM Modi is scheduled to meet Netanyahu, call on President Isaac Herzog and address the Knesset.In a post on X, she wrote: “I hope that the Hon Prime Minister mentions the genocide of thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza while addressing the Knesset on his upcoming trip to Israel and demands justice for them. India has stood for what is right throughout our history as an independent nation, we must continue to show the light of truth, peace and justice to the world.”She emphasised that India has historically taken principled positions on global issues and said the country must continue to uphold truth, peace and justice on the world stage.The Congress party has also criticised the government over its position on the Gaza conflict.Party general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that the government has abandoned the Palestinian cause despite claiming otherwise.In a post on X, Ramesh alleged that PM Modi is displaying “moral cowardice” by embracing Netanyahu while civilians suffer in Gaza.""On May 20 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there. On Nov 29 1981, India issued a commemorative postage stamp in solidarity with Palestine. On Nov 18 1988, India formally recognised the state of Palestine. That was a different era. Now the Indian Prime Minister is brazenly embracing the Prime Minister of Israel, who has reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. When the entire world is critical of his ‘dear friend’ Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Modi will be displaying moral cowardice,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, the government has described the visit as an opportunity to reaffirm the deep and long-standing India–Israel strategic partnership. According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the two leaders will review progress in cooperation across defence and security, science and technology, innovation, agriculture, water management, trade, and people-to-people exchanges.An upgraded security agreement and progress on a proposed free trade agreement are expected to be key outcomes of the visit.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that his visit to Israel will further consolidate the bond between the two nationsAhead of his two-day visit, PM Modi said that he is looking forward to his discussion with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu.""At the invitation of my dear friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I will be undertaking a State Visit to Israel from 25-26 February 2026. India and Israel share a robust and multifaceted Strategic Partnership that has witnessed remarkable growth and dynamism in recent years,"" the Prime Minister said.""I look forward to my discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu aimed at further strengthening our cooperation across various domains, including science and technology, innovation, agriculture, water management, defence and security, trade and investment, as well as people-to-people ties. We will also exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest,"" he added.PM Modi also expressed confidence that the visit will further strengthen ties between the two countries and set new goals for the strategic partnership.During the visit, I will also meet with Isaac Herzog, President of Israel. I will also have the honour of becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to address the Israeli Parliament, Knesset, an occasion that would be a tribute to the strong parliamentary and democratic ties that bind our two nations.I also eagerly look forward to interacting with the members of the Indian diaspora who have long been nurturing the India-Israel special friendship. I am confident that my State Visit will further consolidate the enduring bonds between the two countries, set new goals for the Strategic Partnership, and advance our shared vision for a resilient, innovative and prosperous future.This will be PM Modi's second visit to Israel. In 2017, he became the first Indian prime minister to travel to the country, a trip that elevated bilateral ties to a strategic partnership. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later visited India in January 2018.During the upcoming visit, Modi is scheduled to hold delegation-level talks with Netanyahu. He will also meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog and address the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Netanyahu is expected to host a private dinner in his honour. The itinerary includes an innovation event in Jerusalem and a joint visit to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center.Defence and security cooperation is likely to feature prominently in the discussions. Israel remains a major supplier of military platforms and weapon systems to India. Both sides are expected to review ongoing engagements and explore further collaboration. According to PTI, India — which is developing an indigenous air defence shield called ‘Sudarshan Chakra’ — may examine the possibility of incorporating certain elements from Israel’s Iron Dome system.Economic engagement is also expected to be high on the agenda. During Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s visit to Israel in November, both sides signed the terms of reference for launching free trade agreement negotiations. In September, the two countries concluded a bilateral investment agreement aimed at expanding economic cooperation. The leaders are also expected to review progress in science and technology, innovation, agriculture, water management, trade, and people-to-people exchanges, the MEA said.The leaders are expected to exchange views on regional and global developments, including the situation in Gaza and broader tensions in West Asia. Ahead of the visit, Netanyahu described the trip as “historic” and referred to Modi as a “dear friend.” He also outlined a broader diplomatic vision to build a “hexagon” of alliances involving India, Arab nations, African countries, and Mediterranean states, aimed at strengthening coordination among like-minded countries and countering radical axes in the region.","Prime minister narendra modi will visit israel on february 25-26, 2026.

NEW DELHI: The raging political row over the Youth Congress’ protest at the global AI summit echoed Tuesday at a parliamentary committee meeting as it passed a resolution condemning the incident amid dissent by MPs from different opposition parties.“The committee would like to place on record its appreciation for successfully organizing the India Al Impact Summit by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the able leadership of PM Narendra Modi. The committee also condemns the unfortunate incident happened on 20-2-2026 at the venue of the India Al Summit,” the resolution shared by the panel’s chairperson, Nishikant Dubey, said.It was carried by a majority vote, with 10 MPs affiliated to the BJP-led alliance voting for it and six, including from Congress, TMC, SS(UBT) and Samajwadi Party, polling against it, sources said.Though it is not common for parliamentary committees to take up issues outside their listed agenda, official sources said rules permit them to convey their sense on matters of importance, more so as the summit was hosted by the IT ministry, which is overseen by the Dubey-led panel.An opposition MP claimed they protested because the committee was wading into “politics” over the protest and noted that members of even non-Congress parties voted against the resolution despite some like Samajwadi Party having spoken against the shirtless demonstration of Youth Congress members.BJP MP Amar Pal Maurya proposed the resolution. He told TOI, “The resolution was for condemning the incident that tried to malign the country's image and was not against any party. Everyone should have supported it. In fact, those who did not were doing politics.”Those who voted against it included Priyanka Chaturvedi of SS(UBT), Devesh Shakya of Samajwadi Party and Saket Gokhale of TMC, sources said.The resolution lauded the five-day summit as a “grand success”, emphasising that its declaration from 91 countries and leading companies committed to inclusive Al development. The companies announced over USD 200 billion Al investment in India, it said, adding that Google besides committing for a big data centre in India also pledged to lay direct sea cable link between India and the USA.","The resolution was carried by a majority vote, with 10 mps affiliated to the bjp-led alliance voting for it and six, including from congress, tmc, ss(ubt) and samajwadi party, polling against it.

"Stock Market Today: Why did stock market crash today? Nifty50 ends below 25,450; BSE Sensex over 1,000 points down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stock-market-today-nifty50-bse-sensex-february-24-2026-dalal-street-indian-equities-global-markets-donald-trump-tariffs/articleshow/128738404.cms,"Stock market today



Why stock market crashed today: Top reasons

1) Fresh blow to IT stocks

2) New tariff warning from Trump

3) US tech rout spills over to Asia

4) Rupee weakens against the dollar

5) Concerns over possible US action against Iran

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex tanked in trade on Tuesday on weak global cues and IT stocks rout along with fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. While Nifty50 dropped over 300 points, BSE Sensex went below the 82,000 intraday. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,424.65, down 288 points or 1.12%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,225.92, down 1,069 points or 1.28%.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “President Trump’s State of the Union address today and the message that he would convey will be keenly watched by markets globally. The EU freezing the deal with the US in the light of the tariff changes following the US Supreme Court verdict and Trump’s warnings to countries backing away from deals indicate that the tariff drama has more in store for economies and markets. We will have to wait and watch how this drama plays out.”“Meanwhile the trend of weakness in tech stocks stemming from the potential AI impact continues. The weakness in the ADRs of Indian IT companies indicates that this segment will continue to remain under pressure.”“A positive trend in the market that will have significant bearing on the markets is the change in the FII strategy in India. FIIs have been buyers in ten out of the last seventeen trading sessions indicating their renewed interest in India.The improving corporate earnings in India is the principal reason for this change in FII stance. Given the robust macros of the Indian economy and improving corporate earnings, this FII buying trend can continue. Therefore, sectors in which FIIs have been buyers like capital goods and financials will remain resilient and the IT segment in which they have been sellers will continue to be weak. So, watch out for the stocks in these segments.""The crash has eroded approximately Rs 4.6 lakh crore in investor wealth, pulling the overall BSE market capitalisation down to nearly Rs 464 lakh crore.Technology counters such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and HCL Technologies came under intense selling pressure after Anthropic announced that its Claude Code tool can help modernise legacy systems built on COBOL.Shares of Infosys dropped nearly 3%, while HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Persistent Systems fell over 2% each. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Wipro and other IT stocks declined by around 2%, dragging the Nifty IT index down more than 2% to 30,849.05.Anthropic said on Monday that Claude Code could automate much of the exploration and analytical work involved in upgrading COBOL-based systems. The development triggered a sharp selloff in US markets as well, with IBM plunging 13% overnight.COBOL, short for Common Business-Oriented Language, was developed in the late 1950s and remains widely used for business data processing, including payment systems and retail transactions. Anthropic estimates that about 95% of ATM transactions in the United States still depend on COBOL, highlighting the potential for artificial intelligence-driven cost efficiencies in this segment.Investor anxiety intensified after US President Donald Trump signalled a tougher trade approach. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump cautioned that countries seeking to “play games” with the recent court decision would be met with sharply higher tariffs.His comments followed Friday’s ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, which invalidated tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Reacting to the judgment, Trump said he would move to implement a 15% universal tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 instead.Asian equities weakened in early Tuesday trade after a sharp decline on Wall Street rattled global sentiment. Markets were pressured by lingering uncertainty over Trump’s tariff direction as well as escalating geopolitical risks.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, the MSCI Asia-Pacific ex Japan Index, gave up earlier advances following a six-session rally and was last trading 0.2% lower, with South Korean stocks leading the losses.In contrast, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.7% as trading resumed after a public holiday. S&P 500 e-mini futures edged up 0.1%.In the United States overnight, the S&P 500 dropped 1.0%, erasing the gains recorded in the previous week. Fears that artificial intelligence could disrupt employment and profitability in software and other sectors also dragged the Nasdaq Composite down 1.1%.The Indian rupee slipped 0.07% to 90.95 against the US dollar on Tuesday. A depreciating currency can prompt foreign investors to pull out funds, adding stress to equities. Additionally, a weaker rupee raises the cost of imports, particularly crude oil, potentially fuelling inflation and compressing profit margins for companies reliant on imported inputs. This dynamic can weigh on earnings outlooks and investor confidence.Uncertainty has also been fuelled by geopolitical tensions. While fresh talks between the United States and Iran are set to be held in Geneva, Donald Trump said on Friday that he was weighing the possibility of a strike if Tehran failed to reach an agreement with Washington. “I guess I can say I am considering that,” he remarked in response to a reporter’s question.Reacting to the statement, Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Monday that any US military action, even limited strikes, would be regarded as an “act of aggression” and would prompt a response.",Nifty50 and bse sensex tanked in trade on tuesday on weak global cues and it stocks rout along with fresh tariff threats from us president donald trump.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128738431,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-110334,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Indian Influencer Claims 38 Hour Ordeal In South Korea Raises Questions On Traveller Rights Abroad

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday issued an advisory urging Indian nationals to exercise caution while traveling to Jeju Island, South Korea, following the detention of content creator Sachin Awasthi.In its advisory, the Embassy highlighted that from time to time, it receives reports of inconveniences faced by Indian travellers, including denial of entry or repatriation upon arrival in Jeju Island under the visa waiver scheme. To minimize such situations, Indian nationals are advised to carefully note the entry requirements and precautions before traveling.The Embassy emphasized that entry under the Jeju visa-free facility is strictly for short-term tourism.""Final admission into the Republic of Korea is determined solely by the immigration authorities at Jeju International Airport in accordance with Korean law. The visa waiver scheme does not guarantee entry,"" it said.Travelers are required to carry mandatory documents including confirmed return air tickets, hotel reservations covering the entire stay, detailed day-wise travel itinerary, proof of sufficient funds, a passport valid for at least six months, travel insurance and accommodation contact details.The advisory warned that passengers unable to clearly explain their travel plan could be at risk of entry denial.The Embassy also highlighted the importance of financial preparedness, stating that ""travelers should be able to demonstrate adequate financial capacity for the duration of stay including for daily expenses, accommodation payment and transport arrangements."" Immigration officers may conduct interviews upon arrival and travelers are advised to respond truthfully and consistently while remaining calm.Indian nationals are reminded that the Jeju visa waiver does not permit travel to mainland Korea, and attempting to leave Jeju without a visa is illegal. Overstays or unauthorized activity could lead to future travel bans. If entry is refused, the passenger will be returned on the next available flight and temporary stay in a holding facility may be required.The advisory comes in the wake of Sachin Awasthi’s detention for 38 hours at Jeju Island. Awasthi, along with his wife, was denied entry, kept in a detention center and forced to book an expensive return ticket.“I am not sharing this for sympathy or drama. Immigration decisions are their authority. But they did not have any right to treat us like criminals,” he said.Jeju Island is one of the three self-governing provinces of South Korea with a special visa-free entry program for foreigners. Indian travelers can enter without a visa only if arriving directly from a foreign country, as entry via mainland South Korea requires a visa.","The indian embassy in seoul issued an advisory urging indian nationals to exercise caution while traveling to jeju island, south korea.

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: A group of 277 prominent personalities on Tuesday issued a joint statement condemning the “shirtless” protest by workers of the Indian Youth Congress during the AI Impact Summit last week, describing it as a “grotesque betrayal of national dignity. ”The signatories include 149 former officers from the armed forces and the IPS, 102 retired bureaucrats, and 26 ex-judges. They said they are ""shocked beyond belief.""“The recent unpardonable spectacle at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, where members of the Indian Youth Congress staged a ‘shirtless’ protest within the corridors of Bharat Mandapam, is a grotesque betrayal of national dignity. At a time when some of the world’s most influential tech leaders, global CEOs and international delegates had gathered to witness India’s rise as a key architect of the future, this scripted tantrum served only to defame the country on the global stage,” the statement read.The release further contended that by choosing a high-level diplomatic and technological forum for their demonstration, the protesters “prioritised personal optics over the prestige of the Republic.”The signatories further described the protest as a “premeditated act of sabotage” rather than a “spontaneous expression of dissent.”“Entering a secure, international venue under the guise of legitimate participants using QR codes, only to strip and engage in vulgar sloganeering, is a breach of both security and basic decorum.Such behaviour is not ‘activism’ — it is an ‘anti-national disruption’ designed to signal instability to global investors and partners,” the statement asserted.“For any political entity to use an international summit as the backdrop for a ‘topless’ ruckus is to tell the world that India is a land of chaos rather than a sophisticated global power. It mocks the hard work of our scientists, the aspirations of our engineers, and the hospitality of 1.4 billion citizens who take pride in hosting the world,” it added.The eminent personalities acknowledged that democratic protest is a fundamental right, but stressed that “it is not a license for anarchy or the public humiliation of the nation.” They condemned what they described as “an attempt to hijack a national milestone for partisan theatre of absurdity.”“Politics must stop at the patriotic edge, and international forums must remain off-limits for the undignified internal squabbles of any political party. Such actions did not hurt a government; they hurt a nation. We call for a collective rejection of any political culture that finds pride in the public defamation of the Motherland,” they concluded.","The signatories include 149 former officers from the armed forces and the ips, 102 retired bureaucrats, and 26 ex-judges.

From Epstein Files to Trade Deal, Rahul Gandhi Launches All-Out Attack on PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to scrap the India-US trade deal, which he described as being against the interests of Indian farmers.Addressing the 'Kisan Mahachaupal' farmers' rally in Bhopal, Gandhi called the interim trade deal an ""arrow piercing the hearts of Indian farmers"".""After the US Supreme Court ruling on the trade deal, I challenge PM Modi to scrap it...but he won't be able to do so,"" the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha said.Rahul's demand comes in the backdrop of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's global tariffs and invalidating it.The Congress leader also made a series of serious allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, claiming the PM rushed into a trade deal with the United States in the interest of his minister Hardeep Puri and industrialist Gautam Adani, who Rahul said is the ""BJP's financial structure"".Rahul Gandhi claimed Union minister Hardeep Puri's name in the infamous Epstein files was released to ""threaten"" the PM, and that there are ""videos and messages which have not been released from the millions of Epstein files"" held up in the US.In another allegation, Rahul claimed that the case against Adani in the United States is not against the industrialist but against PM Modi, adding that these two were the reasons behind PM Modi's withdrawal from Parliament and finalisation of the trade pact with America that had been stuck for months.""Millions of Epstein files are held up in the US; there are videos and messages which have not been released. Hardeep Puri's name was released to threaten him. PM Modi must clear his relationship Anil Ambani ?... Adani is not a small company; it is the BJP's financial structure. Adani faces criminal charges in the US. He cannot go to the US or Europe. The target of the case in the US is Modi, not Adani... These were the two reasons why Modi withdrew from Parliament,"" claimed Rahul Gandhi.Rahul said: ""He left and called Trump, saying, 'Sir, I'm ready to do whatever you say', and he sold the country... Narendra Modi is compromised; he was trapped and forced to sign the US-India trade deal .""He claimed that PM Modi called US President Donald Trump to finalise the trade deal on the same day he, as leader of the opposition, questioned the Prime Minister in the Lok Sabha over ex-Army chief MM Naravane’s book.Further questioning the timing of the deal, which had been dragging on for months, the Gandhi scion stepped up his attack on the PM, saying he sealed the deal with Trump ""without even consulting his Cabinet"".Rahul, repeating his ""PM Modi sold India's farmers, garment industry and data"" charges, said: ""I want to say two or three more things. Listen carefully after my speech ends. The moment my speech ended, the Prime Minister left the Lok Sabha. In the evening, without consulting Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Chouhan, Gadkari, in fact, without consulting his Cabinet, Narendra Modi called Trump. Trump tweeted that the Prime Minister of India had called him and said he was ready to sign the US–India deal. For four months, nothing happened, and suddenly Narendra Modi called and sold out India’s farmers, sold out India’s garment industry, and handed over all our data to America.""The Congress leader also said that the ruling NDA made a false excuse that the opposition women MP had planned to attack PM Modi during his reply to the motion of thanks on the President's address.""I want to ask, this deal had been stalled for four months. For four months, nothing moved. Narendra Modi left the Lok Sabha; you all saw it on TV. The next day, a false excuse was made, saying there was going to be an attack on him. The truth is that the Prime Minister could not stand in Parliament and then directly call Trump. Why did he do this?"" the Raebareli MP asked.Cornering the central government over General MM Naravane's unpublished book, Rahul Gandhi said: ""Former Army chief General MM Naravane (Retd) wrote a book mentioning that when the Chinese tanks were entering the Indian boundary, he called Rajnath Singh for the orders, but did not get an answer. He said that even Ajit Doval and S Jaishankar did not answer... The decision of war is taken by the Prime Minister, but the PM did not answer, he hid in his room and asked the Army Chief to do whatever he deems fit. .. The Army Chief wrote that he was left alone by the Indian government that day.""""Decision to go to war is political, not a military one,"" the Congress leader said.","Congress leader rahul gandhi calls interim trade deal an ""arrow piercing the hearts of indian farmers"" gandhi claims pm rushed into a trade deal with the united states in the interest of his minister hardeep puri and industrialist gautam adani.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128750465,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-17466,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

India’s First Counter-Terror Doctrine PRAHAAR: Playbook To Counter Hybrid Terror To Radicalisation

.

Prahaar aims at graded police response to radicalisation

Prahaar calls for global cooperation to tackle terror

NEW DELHI: Government on Monday unveiled the country's first-ever anti-terror policy elevating its ""pro-active and intelligence-guided"" approach to the level of a doctrine, which focuses, apart from the persisting threat of ""hostile neighbours"" deploying terror, on the new challenges of terrorists using modern communication devices and criminal networks.'Prahaar', an acronym for India's comprehensive counter-terrorism policy and strategy, aims at criminalising all terrorist acts and starving terrorists, their financiers and supporters of funding, weapons, safe havens and cyber resources.The policy rests on seven key pillars, represented by each letter of the acronym. It focuses on 'prevention' of terror attacks; 'responses' that are swift and proportionate; 'aggregating' of internal capacities for a whole-of-govt approach; 'human rights' and rule of law-based processes for mitigation of threats; 'attenuating' the conditions enabling terrorism, including radicalisation; 'aligning' international efforts to counter-terrorism; and 'recovery' through a whole-of-society approach.Stating that India has been at the forefront of the fight against terrorism, the policy refers to 'neighbours' which use terrorism as an instrument of the state, highlighting threats from jihadi outfits as well as global terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda.Describing the way forward, the policy hints at the scope for further collaboration among various agencies on intelligence collection and investigation.While seeking amendments in the counter-terror legal framework ""from time to time"", it underlines the continual need for building capacity of state-level counter-terror mechanisms and unity in their structure, resources, training and investigation methods.Stating that violent extremists based on foreign soil are using the latest technologies, including drones, to unleash terror in Punjab and J&K, the policy flags the use of organised criminal networks for logistics and recruitment, for executing terror strikes in India.Also, drawing attention to the use of social media and instant messaging apps for terror communication and propaganda, the policy concedes how encryption, dark web and crypto have allowed terror groups to operate with anonymity.With foreign-based terror groups relying on infrastructure, logistics and terrain knowledge of local outfits for trans-national terror attacks, Prahaar emphasises the need for international cooperation and collaboration, including to counter the misuse of information and communications technology (ICT) by terrorists, with investments in technology and partnerships with private enterprise.The counter-terror strategy aims at preventing attacks with a ‘pro-active and intelligence-guided’ approach with synergy among the central and state agencies. Similarly, it calls for pro-active disruption of cyber activities of terror groups and continuous disruption of overground worker networks by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs).For timely counter-terror response, the strategy requires all stakeholders at central, state and district level to have a uniform anti-terror structure and standard procedures. As regards “aggregating” capacities, LEAs and security agencies must be modernised with the latest tools, technology and weaponry. Prahaar also seeks to safeguard human rights with legal processes that allow multiple levels of redressal and appeal to terror accused.The policy aims at graded police response to radicalisation with legal action dependent on the level of radicalisation. At the same time, socio-economic conditions of vulnerable youths and groups must be addressed with education and constructive engagement, in addition to de-radicalisation programmes.The need to align and shape international efforts against terrorism with treaties and processes like extradition, deportation as per UN norms are also outlined.","India's first-ever anti-terror policy elevates its ""pro-active and intelligence-guided"" approach to the level of a doctrine.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU/DELHI: Not all Army heroes wear uniforms. This is true for Tyson, a four-legged soldier, who showed extraordinary courage by charging first into a terrorist hideout and helping security forces eliminate three Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists in the Chhatroo belt of J&K’s Kishtwar despite being shot in its leg.“Tyson is a local dog adopted and trained by the Indian Army for counter-terror operations,” a source told TOIin Delhi. “The Army’s silent warrior crawled into the hideout carved into the rugged terrain of Chhatroo, prompting the terrorists to open fire,” sources from Kishtwar said over phone. Despite getting a bullet injury, Tyson continued the mission and was the first to reach near the ‘dhok’ and also enabled the security team to reach the hideout and neutralise terrorists. Later, the injured canine was airlifted for medical treatment,” officials said. The dog is now in Udhampur and “is doing fine”.‘Operation Trashi-1’ was a mega multi-agency counter-terror operation that “reflected months of planning and an integrated approach involving the Army’s Counter Insurgency Force (Delta), police force and CRPF”.In a joint press conference of police and Army in Jammu, IGP Jammu B S Tuti on Monday said it all started when a terror group called ‘Israel Group’, comprising seven hardcore terrorists, infiltrated into Indian territory in 2024.They were engaged 17 times over a period of nearly one-and-a-half years. He said three of them were killed in April 2025. “Yesterday was the culmination of this year-and-a-half-long operation,” Tuti said, referring to the killing of JeM commander Saifullah.“Yesterday’s operation is indicative that we have neutralised their leadership in Kishtwar. However, their foot soldiers remain active in other areas,” he said. Though he didn’t specify the number of terrorists, he said around 20 foreign terrorists are believed to be active in the Jammu region.Maj Gen APS Bal, General Officer Commanding, Counter Insurgency Force (Delta), said, “Op Trashi-1 is a “perfect example of perseverance, clarity of thought and seamless coordination at all levels, troops on the ground, corps commanders, ADGs, IGs, between DGP and Army Commander.” He said all available resources were deployed “in a joint and integrated manner, from a dog to a drone.”He said the operation began on Jan 14 in Kishtwar, with first contact established on Jan 18 when the terrorists’ hideout was busted. Further encounters followed on Jan 22, Jan 25 and Jan 31, and again on Feb 4 and Feb 8.During the operation, Maj Gen Bal said, soldiers faced harsh terrain and weather, including snowfall, rain and landslides. The forces were rotated regularly to prevent fatigue, with some teams inserted by helicopter and some through 6-8 hours of trekking.“Every day we sat at the drawing board, reoriented and realigned ourselves, redeployed and started working again,” he said. The senior officer said the first breakthrough came on Feb 4 with the killing of (commander’s aide) Adil. On Feb 21, an input shared by the SSP Kishtwar was passed on to the brigadier of 9 Sector and corroborated through multiple agencies. A joint operation was then launched on the rugged mountains. Reinforcements, including special forces, were quickly mobilised. The Army used real-time surveillance drones and night vision equipment to track and contain terrorist movement.“We achieved success without suffering any casualty or harm to our troops, except the injury to the brave dog Tyson,” Maj Gen Bal said. During the search of the area, till now, war-like stores, including three AK-47 rifles, have been recovered along with bodies of the slain terrorists.","Tyson is a local dog adopted and trained by the indian army for counter-terror operations.

Is Bobby McMann The Toronto Maple Leafs BEST Trade Asset?!

Bobby McMann's contract extension could impact the Toronto Maple Leafs' lineup



The Toronto Maple Leafs are the team that has been the centre of NHL trade rumours this season, and forward by the name of Bobby McMann is one of the most talked about players. The 29 year old that rose through the system of the Leafs, being undrafted, has won a key position on the team. With March 6, NHL Trade Deadlines looming, the discussion has picked up in intensity over whether he will or will not be sold by the Leafs.The fact that McMann played well before the Olympic break strengthened his significance to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He has played time on the top line of the team and has proven himself to be a trustworthy middle-six forward. According to the news posted on NHL, the trade market is not very active; however, a possible extension of the contract with McMann might change the strategy of the Leafs to sell the assets instead of keeping the valuable homegrown talent.As NHL insider Darren Dreger confirms, the talk on Bobby McMann has changed in the past few days. Instead of trading him, there is a possibility of him having an extension of his contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs. It is reported that McMann could be willing to provide a hometown discount, and this may make a more long-term deal attractive to the general manager Brad Treliving and the hockey operations staff of the team.It is reasonable to keep McMann with Toronto. He offers cap-friendly depth, and he also brings stability to the line owing to the fact that he has experience with the team's system of the team. NHL trade rumors may persist, but the extension would assist the Leafs in concentrating on other roster before the March 6 NHL Trade Deadline. The rival clubs tend to find cheap labor force, such as McMann, who will not create significant cap demands.Regardless of the Toronto Maple Leafs making a decision to retain or trade Bobby McMann, the debate surrounding him is going to continue to be the main case in the news and updates of the NHL.","Bobby mcmann's contract extension could impact the toronto maple leafs' lineup.

Stephen Curry’s GOAT replaces Margot Robbie’s Wuthering Heights

Stephen Curry’s GOAT aim for a global milestone



Sony Pictures Animation’s GOAT has officially claimed the number one position at the North American box office, earning $17 million in its second weekend. The movie is produced by NBA superstar Stephen Curry, and ascended to the top spot during the second-weekend and successfully dethroned Warner Bros. ’ Wuthering Heights, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi.As of its tenth day in release, GOAT has amassed a total of $58.3 million domestically and has crossed the $100 million milestone globally. By doing so, the movie has become the fastest original production in Sony Pictures Animation's history to reach that mark.According to studio data, Stephen Curry’s GOAT maintained its momentum with high audience engagement and positive word-of-mouth due to its family-friendly themes. Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights is his take on Emily Brontë's classic 1847 novel by the same name, and initially led the charts during the Valentine’s and Presidents' Day holiday. But saw a sharper 57% decline and finished the weekend with $14.2 million, bringing the cumulative domestic total to $60 million.Though GOAT also saw a 38% dip during the second weekend, the film’s per-theater average remained healthy at $4,401 across 3,863 screens, according to Comscore.The film follows Will (voiced by Caleb McLaughlin), an underdog goat navigating the high-stakes world of roarball, where his size poses a massive disadvantage. This sports-centric narrative, combined with Curry’s promotional reach, helped the film outperform other movies like the faith-based sequel I Can Only Imagine 2, which debuted in third place with $8 million. Following at 4th with $5.8 million was Amazon MGM’s heist thriller, starring Chris Hemsworth, Halle Berry, and Mark Ruffalo.On the international stage, GOAT has mirrored its domestic success and crossed the $102.3 million threshold. The film added $17 million from 51 international markets this weekend, with the United Kingdom leading with $14.5 million to the total.The movie was produced with a $80 million budget, and currently seems to be marching towards significant profitability. As the film prepares to widen its global trajectory by getting released in China, Australia, and South Korea, it is expected to receive a further boost. Given Stephen Curry’s global appeal, the market experts believe the film’s basketball themes will likely resonate strongly in China, where the sport maintains a massive cultural footprint.","Stephen curry’s goat has officially claimed the number one position at the north american box office, earning $17 million in its second weekend.

NFL trade news: Texans shut down C.J. Stroud rumors as GM sends strong message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-trade-news-texans-shut-down-c-j-stroud-rumors-as-gm-sends-strong-message-at-combine/articleshow/128759506.cms,"Image via IMAGN

What did Nick Caserio say about C.J. Stroud trade rumors ?

Is C.J. Stroud’s future secure with the Texans?

The Houston Texans have firmly addressed speculation surrounding quarterback C.J. Stroud’s future, with general manager Nick Caserio making it clear that the franchise has no intention of trading the young star. Trade chatter intensified following the Texans’ divisional round playoff loss, where Stroud struggled in a disappointing performance that sparked debate about his long-term outlook.As NFL executives and media gathered for the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Caserio delivered one of the strongest responses seen this offseason. The Texans’ front office shut down the idea of moving Stroud, signaling continued belief in the quarterback despite recent criticism and statistical regression since his standout rookie season.Nick Caserio left little room for interpretation when addressing the speculation. Speaking to reporters at the combine, the Texans GM dismissed the possibility of a trade and reaffirmed Stroud’s status as the team’s quarterback moving forward.Reports quoted Caserio describing the idea of trading Stroud as “moronic,” while also emphasizing that the quarterback “isn’t going anywhere.” The message was consistent across multiple interviews Houston remains committed to developing its young signal-caller rather than exploring short-term alternatives.The comments came after analysts floated Stroud as a potential trade candidate, especially given the limited quarterback options expected in free agency and the upcoming draft class. Teams searching for a long-term solution were seen as possible suitors, but Houston’s stance appears definitive.Despite the criticism, Stroud still had good regular-season numbers, throwing for more than 3,000 yards with 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions. His ability to move about also made him more valuable, which is why the Texans still see him as a key player.While the Texans’ season ended in disappointment, the organization’s messaging suggests stability at the quarterback position. Stroud remains on his rookie contract with a fifth-year option available, giving Houston flexibility as it evaluates his long-term trajectory.Industry projections already point toward a potential extension in the coming years, with estimates placing Stroud’s future market value among the league’s highest for young quarterbacks. That outlook aligns with Caserio’s emphasis on patience and development.The strong public backing also impacts the wider quarterback market. Teams that may have monitored Stroud’s situation including several QB-needy franchises now appear likely to shift their focus elsewhere.For Houston, the focus moving forward will be surrounding Stroud with improved protection and offensive weapons rather than reconsidering his role. The combine message was clear: despite setbacks, the Texans still view C.J. Stroud as their long-term player.","The houston texans have firmly addressed speculation surrounding quarterback c.j.

Iran China missile deal: Iran to buy Chinese anti‑ship cruise missiles amid Trump’s strike threat — Middle East on edge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/middle-east-on-edge-iran-to-buy-chinese-anti-ship-cruise-missiles-amid-trumps-strike-threat/articleshow/128748624.cms,"'CIA Operates On Lie, Cheat & Steal Doctrine': Jeffrey Sachs ALERTS Iran About 'SECRET' U.S. Plot





Iran is close to finalising a deal with China to purchase advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, Reuters reported, citing six people with knowledge of the negotiations, at a time when the United States is deploying significant naval forces near the Iranian coast amid escalating tensions.The proposed deal involves the Chinese-made CM-302 supersonic anti-ship missiles, which have a reported range of about 290 km and are designed to evade shipborne defences by flying low and fast. Two weapons experts cited by Reuters said that the missiles would significantly boost Iran’s ability to target naval assets in the region.“It’s a complete gamechanger if Iran has supersonic capability to attack ships in the area,” said Danny Citrinowicz, a former Israeli intelligence officer and now senior Iran researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies think tank. “These missiles are very difficult to intercept.”According to the agency, negotiations between Iran and China began at least two years ago but accelerated sharply after the 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June. As talks entered their final stages last summer, senior Iranian officials, including deputy defence minister Massoud Oraei, travelled to China, two security officials said. Oraei’s visit has not been previously reported.The agency said it could not determine how many missiles were involved, the financial terms of the deal, or whether China would proceed given heightened regional tensions.An Iranian foreign ministry official told Reuters: “Iran has military and security agreements with its allies, and now is an appropriate time to make use of these agreements.”The Chinese delegation to the United Nations referred to Beijing’s foreign ministry, which did not respond to requests for comment.The White House also did not directly address the reported negotiations. However, a White House official said US President Donald Trump has been clear that “either we will make a deal or we will have to do something very tough like last time,” referring to the current standoff with Iran.The potential transfer would mark one of the most advanced weapons systems supplied by China to Iran and comes against the backdrop of sanctions first imposed under a United Nations arms embargo in 2006, suspended in 2015 as part of the nuclear deal, and reimposed last September.China, Iran and Russia conduct annual joint naval exercises. Last year, the US treasury sanctioned several Chinese entities for allegedly supplying chemical precursors to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for use in its ballistic missile programme. China rejected those allegations, saying it strictly enforces export controls on dual-use products.The reported missile deal would deepen military ties between Beijing and Tehran, further complicating US efforts to curb Iran’s missile and nuclear programmes as American forces gather in the region, Reuters said.",The proposed deal involves the chinese-made cm-302 supersonic anti-ship missiles.
