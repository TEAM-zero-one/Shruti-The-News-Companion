Wangchuk drew comparisons with Chinese, Pakistani provinces: Govt

NEW DELHI: As the Centre justified on Wednesday the detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk by pointing out his alleged inflammatory speeches and the use of Gandhian principles as a facade, Supreme Court said that it was reading too much into his statements.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the govt won’t review Wangchuk’s detention order on medical grounds as he is “hale and hearty”. Mehta said that the activist was being taken care of in jail and had a minor infection. SC had last week asked the Centre to rethink his continued detention.Referring to one of the speeches, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale said that the activist was himself worried about people resorting to violent protest and that any conclusion has to be drawn by reading the entire speech. Additional solicitor general K M Natraj contended that the speeches and statements were meant to incite people to resort to violent means of protest against govt and he invoked the name of Gandhi and his principles to shield himself.The bench asked if it is objectionable if someone says that he is worried about people abandoning Gandhian principles and resorting to violence. As govt referred to his various speeches and interviews given in previous years, the bench asked it to refer to only those which led to the violence in Sept last year.The ASG alleged that Sonam Wangchuk tried to internationalise the domestic issue of Ladakh, made statements about referendums and plebiscites, and drew comparisons of Ladakh with Chinese and Pakistani provinces. The apex court had earlier directed the authority to conduct a medical examination of Wangchuk by a specialised doctor and file the report before it. The activist is currently lodged in Jodhpur jail. The medical report was placed before the court at the last hearing.Wangchuk was detained on Sept 26 by invoking the NSA against him following protests in Leh over demands of statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh.",Supreme court said that it was reading too much into sonam wangchuk's statements.

'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





Bangladesh will vote Thursday in a Parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for India than any such exercise in the recent past in its neighbourhood. Ironically, with Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League not in the fray, India’s best hopes of a realistic reset in ties with Dhaka rest on a majority for the frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s bête noire and a party with historically fraught ties with New Delhi.Wrongfooted by the 2024 July Uprising that ousted long-term ally Hasina, India intensified its outreach to the BNP realising the then Khaleda Zia-led party offered the optimum choice for future legitimacy and stability in the country. The renewed engagement with BNP leaders, PM Narendra Modi’s offer of help for Zia’s treatment just before her demise and his letter to her son and current leader Tarique Rahman, delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar, firmed up the initiative, despite the restraining factor of Hasina’s presence in India.In the absence of the banned Awami League, the election is expected to see a tight bipolar contest between the BNP alliance and the other major bloc comprising 11 parties – including a curious mix of Islamists and Gen-Z revolutionaries - which is led by India’s traditional foe Jamaat-e-Islami.Jamaat is joined by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political outfit composed of student leaders who led mass protests that toppled Hasina.Apart from the election outcome, India will also closely follow the Constitutional “July Charter” referendum that will take place alongside the general election. With its emphasis on a two-term limit for the PM, introduction of an upper house to review legislation and on Bangladeshi, not Bengali, identity, the referendum seems designed not just to prevent the return of “authoritarianism” but also to minimise India’s deep-rooted cultural and linguistic bonds with the country.While India would not like to delay any outreach to the likely new government, given the significance it attaches to ties with Dhaka for its own security and also Bangladesh’s growing reputation as a “swing state” coveted by powers like the US and China, any such exercise will be mindful of several key concerns.First of course is security. Not allowing Indian insurgent groups in the northeast to use Bangladesh territory against India will top India’s agenda with the new government, given that the BNP-Jamaat government two decades ago was accused of providing safe havens to such groups. Robust security cooperation, including intelligence-sharing, can mitigate concerns.Equally important will be preventing Pakistani forces from using Bangladesh to target Indian interests. The interim government has already effected a dramatic turnaround in ties with Pakistan and efforts to step up defence and security ties with frequent visits to Dhaka by ISI officials will aggravate India’s security concerns. Pakistan pivot is also what the BNP-Jamaat government was accused of in the past. India will also watch closely Chinese ingress into Bangladesh’s defence sector, including a recent deal to manufacture drones not far from Indian territory.The safety and security of the 13-million strong Hindu community will also be on top of India’s agenda with the new government, as evident from the way Modi has himself raised this issue on several occasions. India will expect continued cooperation for transport of goods to the northeast through ports in Bangladesh under the existing frameworks.However, for any outreach to be meaningful, India might have to first address the Hasina factor. The BNP will press on with the demand to extradite Hasina, who has been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity. According to a source in Dhaka, this is an issue that relates to the people’s sentiments and India will not be seen as a reliable ally till the time it is seen as shielding Hasina.While a likely BNP government is expected to aggressively pursue issues related to border killings, water sharing and even revival of SAARC, India might also face a challenge in the form of a resurgent Jamaat that is projected to win anywhere between 50 to 100 seats, more than ever in its history. If that happens, the party could trigger some serious anxiety in India about its role not just as a powerful opposition but also a potential ally of the BNP.","Bangladesh will vote thursday in a parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for india than any such exercise in the recent past.

Gold price prediction

today:

are extending their rally this week, and remain well supported in the long term, says Maneesh Sharma, AVP - Commodities & Currencies, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The expert lists out the top factors that will decide direction of gold prices in the coming days:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold was seen struggling for direction this week, with overall trading activity subdued in the absence of fresh market-moving catalysts. It briefly slipped below the $5,000 psychological level during the early session today, but is still holding above the same.Global equities extending their rally this week is seen weighing on the Bullion in the near term. At the same time, a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD) and softer US Treasury yields are helping to cushion the downside, keeping losses limited and keeping Gold rangebound in near term.Gold witnessed a sharp two-way move last week, initially extending its correction from record highs as profit booking, higher exchange margins and a rebound in the U.S. dollar triggered heavy liquidation, before stabilizing near key technical support around the 50-day moving average. Spot prices rebounded nearly 4% on Friday to close near $4,965 after successfully defending the $4,700–4,750 demand zone, indicating institutional buying and bargain hunting rather than panic selling, while geopolitical risk premiums eased slightly amid improving US–Iran diplomatic signals.Central Bank Demand Still Strong: China’s PBOC added gold for the 15th consecutive month, reinforcing sustained official-sector buying — a key structural pillar behind gold’s multi-year rally and a strong floor during corrections.Structurally, gold remains well supported in the long term by central-bank buying (700–750 tonnes expected in 2026), ETF inflows, reserve diversification and easing-rate expectations.The yellow metal is trying to build a base, with $5,000 now the pivotal near-term pivot, holding above it would strengthen the case for a move toward resistance at $5,090–$5,140, while failure risks a slide back toward $4,750 support.Markets are focused on US jobs and inflation data for clarity on Fed rate cuts, dollar direction, and lingering concerns over Fed independence, while continued central-bank buying, especially from China, keeps the broader bullish structure intact despite near-term range trading.Traders showed a muted reaction to the latest US Retail Sales figures, with Headline Retail Sales flat in December. Attention now turns to the delayed Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report on Wednesday, followed by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Friday.China has urged domestic banks to curb their exposure to US Treasuries on market-risk concerns, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. In response, US Treasury yields remain under pressure across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year yield extending its decline for a second straight day and hovering near 4.18%.","The yellow metal is trying to build a base, with $5,000 now the pivotal near-term pivot.

"'Why was Puri seeking advice from Epstein?' Congress ups the ante, poses 6 questions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-was-puri-seeking-advice-from-epstein-congress-ups-the-ante-poses-6-questions/articleshow/128214475.cms,"Pawan Khera

How did Epstein know about Hardeep’s meeting with Reid even before it had happened? Was Epstein the “contact” who set up the meeting with Reid Hoffman? Why was Hardeep discussing the meeting details with him at all? Why was Epstein being addressed as a ‘friend’? What was Epstein making happen for Hardeep? Why was Hardeep seeking ‘advice’ from Epstein if their association was supposedly incidental or superficial?

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday sharpened its attack on Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri over his remarks on alleged links to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein Party leader Pawan Khera raised six pointed questions and accused the minister of playing down the seriousness of Epstein’s crimes.The row escalated after Puri, responding to Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi , said that he had met Epstein “three or four times” over eight years in a “professional capacity” and that the details were already in the public domain following the release of “three million emails”.Giving context to his attack, Khera referred to an alleged October 4, 2014, email exchange that is part of documents released by the US Department of Justice.Referring to how the interaction allegedly began, he wrote in a post on X, “Today, Hardeep Singh Puri said that his ‘contacts’ introduced him to Reid Hoffman. But what he didn’t say matters more. On October 4, 2014, Epstein emailed Hardeep: ‘Did Reid meeting happen?’ Hardeep replied within hours: ‘I am in SF for meeting this afternoon. You, my friend, make things happen. Any advice?’ Epstein responded: ‘Tell him you will organize his trip to India, to meet with science and tech people and social networking gurus.’”Khera then raised six questions:He also added a post-script which read, “Almost surreal watching Hardeep lose his composure and stutter in anger. Hard to believe this is the same man who once represented India as a diplomat - what a dramatic fall in stature!”In a separate post, Khera accused Puri of trivialising Epstein’s conviction.“Did he just attempt to trivialise Epstein’s crimes? He says that in 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to ‘soliciting favours of a woman who was underage. That’s it? An ‘underage woman’ is a minor. Basically, a child. And you reduce sexual exploitation of a child to ‘that’s it’? Epstein didn’t just face rumours. He pleaded guilty in a Florida court and was convicted. The crime was established in law. Yet you say ‘many of you had doubts. ’ Doubts about what - his own confession?"" he wrote.The Congress leader strongly criticised what he described as an attempt to downplay the seriousness of Epstein’s conviction and questioned the minister’s remarks on the issue.He wrote, “Must God descend from the heavens personally to confirm Epstein’s crime to you? It is deeply disturbing to hear an Indian Union Minister speak about sexual crimes against minors with such casual detachment. Public office demands moral clarity, not minimisation of abuse. Do us a favour, keep this monstrosity at home, and don't ever come out justifying crimes against women and children like this!”At a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Puri accused Gandhi of making “baseless allegations” and said that his remarks in Parliament had “elements of buffoonery” and “entertainment value”.Clarifying his position, Puri said, “There are references to possibly three or four meetings in eight years… Any contact I had with him has no connection to the serious allegations of sexual abuse filed by victims.”He added, “My interaction had nothing to do with that,” stressing that the meetings were linked to his work as India’s Ambassador to the United Nations and later engagements with the International Peace Institute.The controversy began after Rahul Gandhi claimed he had “verified information” and alleged that “there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri.” The exchange has since triggered a sharp political face-off between the ruling BJP and the Congress.",Congress sharpens attack on union minister hardeep singh puri over his remarks on alleged links to disgraced financier jeffrey epstein.

She said the UPA govt had compromised the interest of farmers at Bali on agriculture, and had agreed to the trade facilitation deal, without securing India's interests.She also referred to the Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Statement and accused the Manmohan Singh govt of diluting India's position on sovereignty and security in its engagement with Pakistan.Reacting angrily to Rahul's ""sellout"" charge against PM Narendra Modi, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said no ""mai ka laal' has the audacity to do so and lauded Modi as India's strongest PM. Rijiju, who stood up to challenge Rahul's charges against govt and dared him to authenticate his claims, also said that a privilege motion may be brought against the Congress leader for making false allegations. ""You are levelling serious charges without any proof.You are making wild allegations. Please make substantive points,"" he said.BJP, in any case, would not have let Rahul's claims go unchallenged. But on Tuesday, it was enthused by a ""fact-sheet"" issued by the Trump administration which showed that India got better terms than what the bilateral statement suggested.Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnav took on Rahul for claiming the deal had compromised the ownership of data, saying it was protected under a strong legal regime.Former Anurag Thakur said in Lok Sabha that successive electoral losses had filled Gandhi with hatred.

NEW DELHI: South Block, home to all major decisions in govt for over five decades, will see the prime minister’s office (PMO) move out of the British-era building on Friday afternoon and shift to the newly constructed Seva Teerth.PM Narendra Modi will chair the last Cabinet meeting in South Block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building, which is less than a kilometre from the iconic structure on Raisina Hill.TOI has learnt that after the Cabinet meeting, Union ministers and top bureaucrats will go from South Block to Sewa Teerth, which houses the new PMO, cabinet secretariat, office of National Security Adviser and India House, the new venue to host high-level delegations. Officials said the first Cabinet meeting under PM Jawaharlal Nehru was held in South Block.Cabinet secretariat has already shifted from Rashtrapati Bhawan to Seva Teerth-2 and the shifting of NSA’s office from Sardar Patel Bhawan to Seva Teerth-3 in the new executive enclave is underway.South Block and North Block on Raisina Hill were built in 1931. The history of PMO traces to a small PM’s secretariat (PMS) in 1947 to provide basic administrative help to the PM.The first major structural change happened in 1964 after Lal Bahadur Shastri became PM when PMS got statutory status via Allocation of Business Rules. The authority of the office increased significantly during Indira Gandhi’s tenure and in 1977 it was renamed PMO during Morarji Desai’s tenure.PMO’s shift will be followed by the ministries of defence and external affairs from South Block to multiple offices over the next few weeks. The movement to the new complex means the country's power centre is completely moving out of Raisina Hill. North Block has been vacated completely with ministries moving out of the iconic building to new buildings along Kartavya Path, which was earlier called Raj Path.",Pm narendra modi will chair the last cabinet meeting in south block scheduled on that day before the inauguration of the new administrative building.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri lashed out at Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi over Congress’s repeated attacks over the infamous Epstein files, saying he met Jeffrey Epstein only ""three or four times"" in a professional capacity as part of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism.Puri said the meetings took place before he joined the Union Cabinet in 2017 and are already in the public domain.""I want to remind you that today, during the Parliament session, my name was mentioned in the context of some developments elsewhere—the Epstein files. I just want to share some information... I want to clarify that these facts are all public,"" Puri said at a press conference.He futher added: ""Three million emails have been released, covering the period from May 2009, when I joined as India’s Ambassador to the UN in New York, until I became a minister in 2017. During this period, there are references to only three or four meetings, and my interactions were entirely professional"".Puri said, ""After I resigned as India's ambassador to the UN, I was invited to join the International Peace Institute (IPI) a few months later. I was not part of the IPI per se. I was secretary general of the Independent Commission (ICM) on Multilateralism, set up in the IPI as a project.""""My boss in the IPI, Terje Rod-Larsen, was the person who knew this particular infamous person Mr Epstein and it is as part of a delegation of the IPI or the ICM that I met Mr Epstein on a few occasions, three or maximum four,"" he added.Taking a vile dig at ""yuva neta"" (young leader) Rahul Gandhi, Puri said: ""Epstein Files, the Yuva Neta should know, are about wrongdoing, criminal offences. The Epstein Files are about charges that he had an island where he used to take people to indulge their sexual fantasies, charges of paedophilia, and there are victims of this. Those victims have brought cases against people in authority. My interaction had nothing to do with that. ""Amid the criticism from the opposition over the India-US trade deal, Hardeep Puri said the pact was the best given the tumultuous global situation and that it was just a trailer.Further defending India's economic growth and slamming Rahul Gandhi for echoing Trump's ""dead economy"" claim, Puri said: ""On the one hand, you have leaders who dedicate their lives to transforming the country and work around the clock, and then you have elements of buffoonery. I am choosing my words carefully, elements of buffoonery. I did not call him (Rahul Gandhi) a buffoon; I said elements of buffoonery.”The Union minister also took a dig at Gandhi's conduct in the Lok Sabha, noting, ""Today, Rahul ji was supposed to speak on the budget. While speaking, he started reading the Economic Survey. It's as if there's a pause. Hey, my brother, please read a little. It's very important for India that we have international agreements and trade agreements.""Hardeep Puri's remarks come after Rahul Gandhi alleged that he possesses verified information, saying that ""there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani.""""There's an industrialist whose name is also mentioned, but why hasn't he been arrested? Why are you linking him? The camel is somewhere, and the dog is barking in another city. What are you linking to what? I've already said, there are elements of vulgarity in this. It's only for entertainment value,"" Puri said on Rahul's remark on Anil Ambani.""I have said that I will authenticate the data I have. There are Department of Justice files on Epstein files naming Hardeep Puri and Anil Ambani,"" Gandhi told reporters at parliament premises.Speaking with reporters outside the new Parliament building, Gandhi claimed that the names of Union minister Hardeep Puri and businessman Anil Ambani have figured in the 'Epstein Files' released in the US.He said summons have also been issued in the ongoing case against Adani and the Indian government has not responded to them for the past 18 months.""There is direct pressure on PM Modi. Without any pressure, no prime minister of India would ever compromise on matters concerning the country's farmers, data, energy security, and defence. No one would do this unless there is heavy pressure and a very chokehold over them,"" Gandhi told reporters.In a post in Hindi on X, Gandhi said, ""India-US Trade Deal has mortgaged the future of 140 crore Indians.

India understands - this deal is not one of equals, it is one of compulsion. Whether from the Epstein files or the Adani Case - Modi ji has sacrificed national interest in his bid to save power,"" Gandhi said in his post.Meanwhile, on January 31, the ministry of external affairs spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, strongly dismissed the references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2017 visit to Israel in an email purportedly part of the recently released Epstein Files.MEA spokesperson had dubbed the reference as the ""trashy ruminations"" of a convicted criminal.","Hardeep singh puri said he met jeffrey epstein only ""three or four times"" in a professional capacity as part of the independent commission on multilateralism.

'You Sold Bharat Mata': Rahul Gandhi's Sharp Attack At PM Modi, 'Not Your Servant' Message To Trump

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the recently signed India-US trade agreement, claiming the deal was poorly negotiated and compromised country's interests.Speaking in the Lok Sabha, the Congress leader laid out what he described as the approach INDIA bloc would have taken while dealing with US President Donald Trump.Rahul said that India had failed to leverage its most valuable asset, its data, while negotiating with Washington.Rahul insisted that the INDIA bloc would have taken a far firmer stand with the Trump administration.“I will tell you what we would say. The first thing we would say is President Trump, the most important thing in this equation is Indian data. You want to protect your dollar? We are your friends. We appreciate you. We want to help you protect your dollar. But please remember that if you want to protect your dollar, the biggest asset that can protect your dollar is lying with the Indian people,” he said.“We would tell President Trump, if you want access to Indian data, you will have to talk to us as an equal. We would not be made equal to Pakistan. We would have told Trump: our energy security is our energy security and we are going to protect it.INDIA bloc government would have told Trump 'we will protect our farmers,” Rahul asserted.Rahul also accused the Modi government of surrendering key digital and economic safeguards in the agreement.“If President Trump decided that the Pakistan Army Chief was going to have breakfast with him, then we would have something to say about that. Now what has happened? You've done a trade deal... The thing that is going to transform India in the 21st century, the thing that is going to make us a superpower in the 21st century, this is what the Modi government has done with our data. We give up control over our digital trade rules. Number two, there is no need for data localisation. Number three, free data flow to the United States. Number four, limit on digital tax. Number five, no need to disclose any source code. The finance minister is smiling. She likes to smile a lot. 20-year free tax holiday to anybody who wants it, to the big tax company. This is what you've done on data...” Rahul said.The Congress leader also argued that the deal would sharply increase India’s dependence on American imports while offering little in return.""For first time in history our farmers are facing a storm; you've opened door to crush poor farmers, no PM has ever done this. You have sold India; are you not ashamed of selling India,"" he said.Gandhi alleged that the government has ""sold Bharat Mata"" through the India-US interim trade deal and that it was a ""wholesale surrender"".""You have sold India. Are you not ashamed of selling India? You have sold our mother, Bharat Mata,"" he said while referring to the trade agreement.","Rahul gandhi in lok sabha: 'you sold bharat mata': rahul gandhi's sharp attack at pm modi, 'not your servant' message to trump.

BJP MP Counters Rahul Gandhi’s Trade Deal Attack, Anurag Thakur Says Grip Talk Exposed Weakness

NEW DELHI: Minutes after accusing the Centre of having ""sold out Bharat Mata"" from the floor of the House, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , went on to interrupt the ministers outside.The interuption happened when ministers Ashwini Vaishnaw and Prahlad Joshi stood outside the House, speaking to the reporters. Vaishnaw was speaking about the safety of data of the Indians and how Rahul Gandhi should authenticate the statements before making big charges against the Centre in the House.As the IT minister spoke, Rahul Gandhi walked up to him from behind and started speaking.""Come, let's stand together. Let's do it together,"" the Congress leader said as the ministers walked away.Earlier the day, Rahul alleged that the India–US interim trade deal amounted to a ""wholesale surrender"" and accused the Centre of having ""sold Bharat Mata"", compromising the country’s energy security and farmers’ interests.Speaking in the debate on the Union Budget, Rahul said he did not believe that any Indian prime minister, including Narendra Modi, would agree to such a deal unless there was a ""chokehold"" on him.""Why has he (Modi) sold India - because they (the US) are choking him. They have a grip on his neck,"" Gandhi said, beginning his speech with a martial arts analogy in which a grip is followed by a chokehold until the opponent taps out.He referred to earlier remarks by PM Modi and NSA Ajit Doval that the era of war is over. ""In fact, we are moving into the era of war. War is there in Ukraine, war was there in Gaza, war is there in the Middle East, threat of war is there in Iran, we had Operation Sindoor.""""We are moving into a dangerous world. We have to understand our strengths, and the central strength of our country is our people,"" he said, stressing the need to safeguard the country’s people, data, food supply and energy systems.Rahul said that had an INDIA bloc government negotiated the agreement, it would have insisted on parity with the United States.""The first thing we would say (to Trump) is that the most important asset in this equation is Indian data. If the US wants to protect the dollar, it must recognise that Indian data is the biggest asset. Second thing, we would say to President Trump is that ‘if you want access to it, then you will talk to us as an equal, not talk to us as if we are your servants’,"" he said.He added that an INDIA bloc government would have declared energy security non-negotiable. ""The third thing, we would have told President Trump is that ‘we understand you have agricultural voter base, you need to protect farmers, but we will also protect our farmers’,"" he said.""An INDIA bloc government would say that data is our biggest strength, and now let us talk. We would go there (for negotiating) as an equal. We will not be made equal to Pakistan. If President Trump decided that Pakistan Army chief will have breakfast with him, we will have something to say about it,"" he added.Tje Congress claimed that under the interim deal, India’s energy security had effectively been ceded to the US.""They will decide who we buy oil from, our PM will not decide. They will monitor, and if India buys oil (from where they don't want us to), they will punish us and take tariffs to 50 per cent,"" he said.Accusing the government of enabling ""energy and financial weaponisation"", Gandhi said it had allowed Americans to weaponise ""our finance and our energy against us"".""How can you come to this House and defend this? Are you not ashamed of what you are giving away?"" he asked.""I am saying you have sold India. Are you not ashamed of selling India? You have sold our mother - Bharat Mata.

Key quotes from Rahul Gandhi’s speech

“We are moving from a world of stability to a world of instability. PM Modi and NSA stated that era of war is over but we are moving into the era of war. There is war in Ukraine, Gaza, we had Operation Sindoor. The Dollar is being challenged. US supremacy is being challenged.”

“When you move into a dangerous world what is the first thing you have to understand? I'd like to tell the house our strengths, the central strength is our 1.4billion people brilliant, energetic, dynamic who can challenge anybody in the world.”

“People create data. We have the biggest data pool on the planet. 1.4 billion people means massive amount of data is being generated in India. Everybody talks about AI but talking AI is like talking about internal combustion engine without petrol. The petrol for AI is data.... meaning if you have AI and you don't data, you have nothing. Which are the two biggest pools of data on the planet? The Indian pool of data and Chinese pool of data.”

“Population is a strength but only if you recognise that data is important.”

“If Americans want to remain superpower, protect their dollar, then key to that is Indian data .”

.” “In a contest between US and China the single most valuable asset is Indian data. If US wants to remain a superpower and want to protect their dollar the key to that is Indian data.”

“If INDIA bloc was negotiating with President Trump, we would say 'most important thing in this equation is Indian data'.”

“President Trump, if you want access to this data, then please understand that you are going to talk to us as an equal. You're not going to talk to us as if we are your servants.”

“We would tell President Trump, if you want access to Indian data, you will have to talk to us as an equal.”

“We would not be made equal to Pakistan. If President Trump decided that the Pakistan Army Chief was going to have breakfast with him, then we would have something to say about that.”

“The thing that is going to transform India in the 21st century, the thing that is going to make us a superpower in the 21st century, this is what the Modi government has done with our data. We give up control over our digital trade rules. Number two, there is no need for data localisation. Number three, free data flow to the United States. Number four, limit on digital tax. Number five, no need to disclose any source code. The finance minister is smiling. She likes to smile a lot. 20-year free tax holiday to anybody who wants it, to the big tax company. This is what you've done on data...”

“Budget recognises energy and finance are being weaponised but nothing in budget that looks into this.”

“We need to protect our people, data, food supply and energy system.”

“I would warn govt AI is going to have many consequences; companies at forefront of information technology will struggle.”

“In martial arts, the sequence is grip, choke, and tap. This grip also exists in politics. But, in politics the grip, choke, and tap remain hidden.”

“... I am saying that you have sold India. Are you not ashamed of selling India? Do you have no shame in selling India? You have sold our mother, Bharat Mata. The interesting thing is that I know that the Prime Minister would not sell India under normal circumstances. You know why he sold India? Because they are choking him. They have got a grip on his neck... We can see fear in the eyes of the Prime Minister. There are two things- first, Epstein. 3 million files are still locked up...”











NEW DELHI: Leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday mounted a sharp attack on the Union Budget 2026-27, accusing the government of compromising India’s strategic interests in a volatile global order and “selling” the country’s data in its trade engagement with the United States.Speaking during the Budget discussion, Gandhi framed his remarks around what he described as a shift from global stability to instability, warning that India must protect its people, data, energy and food systems in an era of geopolitical conflict and financial weaponisation.He began by citing the Economic Survey. “I was looking at the economic survey and two points I found there, solid points, profound points that I liked. First point, that we are living in a world of intensifying geopolitical conflict... The dominance of the United States is being challenged by the Chinese, by the Russians, by other forces. The second thing is that we are living in a world of energy and financial weaponisation. The main thing they are saying here is that we are moving from a world of stability to a world of instability.”Rahul Gandhi Gandhi took aim at earlier statements by the government.“Prime Minister stated, and NSA stated, shockingly, some time back, that the era of war is over. In fact, we are moving into the era of war. You can see war is there in Ukraine, war was there in Gaza, war is there in the Middle East, threat of war is there in Iran. We had operations in Sindoor. So we are moving into a world of instability. The dollar is being challenged. The central game, as my friends on the other side understand, is that dollar is being challenged, US supremacy is being challenged. We are moving from a world of one superpower to some new world that really we can't predict...”Rahul Gandhi argued that in the 21st century, data has become India’s most valuable asset. “... What we put on the table is our people. Their wisdom, what they do, their likes, dislikes, their imagination, and their fear. This has suddenly, in the 21st century, got value. In the 20th century, it had no value. I remember so many people saying that population is a weight, population is a disaster. No, population is the biggest asset you can have. It's a strength. But it's only a strength if you recognise that data.”The Congress leader said that in a dangerous global environment, India must first recognise its strengths. “Moving into a dangerous world, we have to understand our strengths; central strength of our country is our people.”","'you sold bharat mata': rahul gandhi's sharp attack at pm modi, 'not your servant' message to trump.key quotes from rahul gandhi’s speech: “we are moving from a world of stability to aworld of instability.” “in a contest between us and china the single most valuable asset is indian data” rahul gandhi says india must protect its people, data, energy and food systems.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128196664,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-52870,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones and wish a speedy recovery to the injured. India stands in solidarity with the people of Canada in this moment of profound grief.”The shooting took place at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies have been made available to the public by Penguin Random House India. Any copies currently in circulation constitute an infringement of PRHI’s copyright and must immediately be ceased. PRHI shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. ”The memoir is yet to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence.The excerpt was published by an online portal. In it, Naravane, who was the 28th Chief of Army Staff from December 2019 to April 2022, quotes defence minister Rajnath Singh as conveying Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s message: “Jo uchit samjho woh karo” (take whatever action you deem appropriate).The purported remarks were made in August 2020, at the height of the India–China military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Opposition has claimed that the vagueness of the alleged instructions amounted to an “abdication” of responsibility by PM Modi during the crisis.","Former army chief gen naravane endorses penguin statement on his ""unpublished"" memoir.

'Modi Sold Bharat Mata': Rahul Blasts Centre Over India-US Trade Deal, Govt hits back

‘Farmers left to mercy of mechanised US farms’

Leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi accused the govt Wednesday of “completely surrendering” India’s core data, food and energy interests in the trade deal, in a sharp attack in Lok Sabha on PM Modi who, he alleged, had caved in to pressure due to the leverage that country has over him.Participating in the discussion on the Budget, Gandhi began his speech with mention of the concept of grip and chokehold players are taught in martial arts to floor rivals and then used the metaphor to target Modi in the US’s handling of him. Gandhi’s condemnation of the interim pact as a sellout of national interest was the theme of his speech.Rahul said the data of 140 crore Indians is the country’s most valuable asset, while the nation needs to secure its energy and food interests in these turbulent times.The LoP’s controversial references to a convicted child sex offender in the US, two Indian businessmen and Bharat Mata as he sought to corner govt was met with resistance from treasury benches and were expunged from records.He alleged that minister Hardeep Puri had introduced an Indian businessman to the child sex offender, and the files released by the US govt mention their names. The Chair asked him not to level the allegations.Rahul Gandhi’s condemnation of the interim trade pact as a sellout of national interest was the theme of his speech, hitting the BJP-led NDA govt on a plank which it has practically owned since coming to power in 2014.He alleged, “The most valuable asset (data) of India has been handed over. Our farmers have been left to the mercy of mechanised American farms. Our textiles have been wiped out. Our energy security has been handed over. We cannot buy oil from who we want to buy it from. This is a wholesale surrender.”Unlike Modi’s and NSA Doval’s assertion that it is not an era of war, Rahul said the world is in fact “moving into an era of war and instability” amid intensifying geo-political conflicts. Dollar’s supremacy is being challenged and world is moving away from the era of one superpower, he said.While the budget recognises these challenges, including the weaponisation of energy and finance, it offers no future pathways, he said, before turning to the agreement to hit out at govt.He alleged the deal has compromised security in all three critical things needed to run a modern country: data, food supply and energy.","Opposition leader rahul gandhi accused the govt of “completely surrendering’ india’s core data, food and energy interests in the trade deal.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THRISSUR: CPM on Tuesday launched efforts to pacify pro-Left writer and Sahitya Akademi president K Satchidanandan , who caused embarrassment to LDF govt ahead of assembly polls by warning against dangers of returning the same political formation to power repeatedly.Party district secretary K V Abdul Khader and Sahitya Akademi vice-president Asokan Charuvil met Satchidanandan at his residence, in an apparent conciliation bid.After the meeting, Khader and Charuvil sought to underplay the row. According to them, Satchidanandan clarified that he was making a general observation and wasn’t referring specifically to the situation in Kerala. They said Satchidanandan also alleged that media had distorted some of his remarks.However, Satchidanandan said he stood by his statement on the dangers of returning a party to power repeatedly. He said he had personally witnessed the disastrous consequences of such an experience in West Bengal.“I have seen the degeneration of Bengal communist party. As the party came to power repeatedly, more and more corrupt and power-hungry people flocked into the party. Dictatorial tendencies can take a firm grip over a party which remains in power for a long period.This is true, not just for CPM, but for any party,’’ he said.“I wasn’t suggesting a change of ruling party every five years. I’m not referring to a particular time limit at all, but I’m raising my concerns of dangers to democracy if any political formation remains in power for a long period,’’ he said, referring to former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac’s criticisms against him.He chastised suggestions that he shouldn’t criticise govt, which was paying him as president of Sahitya Akademi. “That is only a reminiscence of reactionary thinking that the relationship between Akademi president and govt is akin to feudal landlord and a tenant,’’ he said.Satchidanandan dismissed cyber attacks against him by Left sympathisers, saying, “It is evident that virtual fools’ paradise of cyber crowds didn’t even try to understand the implications of what I was trying to convey and which was completely lost in the verbal bullfight on this Lilliput.”General education minister V Sivankutty alleged that Satchidanandan had criticised without doing proper homework and analysis of political ground realities.Unlike CPM leaders, CPI functionaries took a softer approach to Satchidanandan’s criticisms of ruling LDF. CPI state secretary Binoy Viswam and minister K Rajan said LDF considered Satchidanandan a genuine ally and his criticisms would be heeded with utmost respect. There won’t be any attempt to stifle dissenting voices from friends of the Left like Satchidanandan, they said.Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan continued to support criticisms by Satchidanandan and activistwriter Sarah Joseph against the CPM-led govt and said the cultural leaders were actually giving voice to the opinions of a vast majority of people.",K satchidanandan caused embarrassment to ldf govt ahead of assembly polls.

His behaviour during parliamentary proceedings has been lethargic.""The BJP MP said, ""The behaviour of the Congress party in the House has been no better than what one might witness on the roadside. Such conduct is unbecoming in a parliamentary setting. We saw how women were used as a shield as people moved towards the treasury bench, holding banners, recalls the memories of Shaheen Bagh.""Right after Rahul Gandhi's speech in the House, Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju, trading barbs at Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi, remarked that Congress does not like the idea of a progressing India. Responding to Rahul Gandhi's comment about ""the PM selling India,"" Rijiju remarked that no ""mai ka laal"" could ever sell India.Rijiju said, ""Rahul Gandhi claims that our country, India, has been sold.I want to say this in front of the House, nobody could ever sell India.
