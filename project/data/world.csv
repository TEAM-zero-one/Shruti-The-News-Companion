30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas.

From Vadodara and Ahmedabad, a small band of 70-plus Indians is rewriting the script of retirement - skydiving, scuba diving, bungee jumping, even trekking across Antarctica's frozen expanse.Gautam Kothari, 74, has lost vision in one eye. His wife Beena, 72, cannot walk long distances. Together, they have leapt from aircraft, plunged into oceans, and dangled over canyons. The Kotharis stood at the edge of the world in polar cold. They cruised icy waters, met a lone lighthouse family in one of the planet's remotest outposts. In four years, they have travelled to 14 countries.

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Created in collaboration with RMZ Foundation and India Art Fair and supported by Alkazi Foundation, the show revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘The Great Hedge of India’.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.The hedge entered public conversation again in recent years. In 2022, UK-based runner Hannah Cox set out to trace the forgotten border by running 100 marathons in 100 days, following the path of the Great Hedge across the country. Her journey — physically retracing a line most Indians have never seen — sparked renewed interest in how a structure so long, so intrusive, and so central to colonial revenue vanished almost without a trace.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”","'salt lines' is the first indian solo exhibition by artist duo himali singh soin and david soin tappeser who go by hylozoic/desires. The show revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘the great hedge of india’ the hedge of halomancy is a 23-minute film about a courtesan known to history for resisting the british.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126206642,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-269872,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the us were carried out from washington dc (3,414) and houston.

'If Pakistan Comes in Dowry...': Rajnath Singh Recalls The Humorous Side of Atal Bihari Vajpayee

India's beloved former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained unmarried his entire life, but there was a time when he was proposed to by a woman, a Pakistani woman to be precise.On the late prime minister's 101st birth anniversary on Thursday, defence minister Rajnath Singh narrated the anecdote, recalling Vajpayee's repartee and sense of humour.Singh recalled that during Vajpayee's visit to Lahore, a Pakistani woman reporter proposed to him, inspired by his speech.""I would like to share one incident. Inspired by his speech, a Pakistan i reporter said she was ready to marry him, but sought ceding of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan in Mehr,"" Singh said.Atalji, with a smile on his face, said, 'Madam, I am ready to marry you, but in return, I want Pakistan as dowry,"" Singh said, drawing laughter and applause from the audience.Vajpayee definitely had a way with his words. He was admired for his oratory skills across parties and was an accomplished poet known for his patriotic and humanist compositions.Once, when a supporter urged him to remain ""atal"" (unshakeable), Vajpayee quipped back playfully, with, ""Atal toh hoon, lekin Bihari bhi hoon!"" (“I am Atal, but I am also a Bihari!”).Vajpayee travelled to Lahore by bus in 1999 and embraced Pakistan’s then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, a gesture that came to symbolise hope for better ties between the two neighbours.However, the bonhomie did not last long. Just months later, the Pakistan Army carried out a covert operation to send troops into the Kargil sector of Jammu and Kashmir, triggering a limited conflict that Pakistan ultimately lost.Rashtra Prerna Sthal was inaugurated by PM Modi on Thursday and has been developed as a landmark national memorial and inspirational complex of enduring national significance.

Bangladesh Unrest: Another Hindu Man Lynched; Police Claim Extortion Bid





LONDON: A protest by Hindus over the lynching of Dipu Das and general persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh outside the Bangladesh high commission in London was met with a counter-protest by Khalistanis on Saturday.More than 500 protesters, mostly Bangladeshi and Indian-origin Hindus shocked by the brutal lynching of garment factory worker Dipu Chandra Das on Dec 18 in Mymensingh, joined the protest and shouted “Hindus Lives Matter”.They carried placards calling for justice for Das, for minorities to be saved, and raising the incarceration of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das.A digital van drove around with flashing images that read “Hindus have right to live.”The protest, organised by Bengali Hindu Adarsha Saangha (UK), was peaceful. Protesters stood behind barriers, on the opposite side of the road to the mission.Then around 10 men arrived directly in front of the high commission holding yellow Khalistani flags, shouting anti-India and anti-Hindu slogans, and praising the recently assassinated extremist Sharif Osman Hadi . Police then arrived to keep the two sides apart.One of the organisers, Prajjwal Biswas, from West Bengal, said, “I don’t know why Khalistanis are protesting as this is not their cause.They are trying to instigate us.”Bangladesh-born Shuchishmita, whose wider family still live in Bangladesh, said, “The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh is something that has been going on for centuries and no media speaks about it. I am here to ask for justice for the Hindu community. We shouldn’t tolerate what is happening.”Vikram Banerjee, a British PIO whose family migrated from then East Pakistan to India, said: “We want India and the UK to take assertive action.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team.Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars. Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity.The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick mahomes' 15 and the mahomies foundation is making a significant community impact.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that negotiations were showing “slow but steady progress,” but Russia continues to press its own demands, reported AP.The Kremlin insists that Ukraine surrender the territory it still controls in the Donbas, a demand Kyiv has rejected. Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he will meet us president donald trump in florida over the weekend.

From December 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-US citizens, including Green Card holders, at border points comes into effect. This means their photographs would be taken by US Customs and Border Protection officials at every entry and exit point across airports, land crossings and seaports. This new rule is applicable to all non-US citizens entering or exiting the country. Children below 14 years and adults over 79 years are also included.The biometric system aims to address security and visa-overstay concerns. DHS says it is not for broad surveillance, though critics remain wary.This is not entirely new. Biometric collection at exit for the US was limited to pilot programs at select ports. Now this is mandatory.The CBP may also decide to collect fingerprints and iris scans and match them against existing travel documents as part of the Traveler Verification Service.The CBP confirmed that the diplomats are not exempt from the program. They will also have to give their biometrics.Previous regulations allowed diplomats to bypass certain biometric collections; however, the new mandate explicitly removes this exemption, requiring them to provide biometrics upon both entry and exit.Yes, Canadians too are not exempt from the new rule. The new rules are applicable to all non-US travellers even those who are traveling on private aircraft or crossing the border on foot.The rule applies to almost all non-U.S. citizens, including Green Card holders who are the lawful permanent residents and Canadian visitors who were previously exempt from certain requirements.Yes, the biometric collection is not meant for US citizens but the CBP said that US citizens, if they want, can voluntarily participate in the facial biometrics process at entry and exit. U.S. citizens who prefer to opt out of the facial biometrics process may simply notify a CBP officer or airline representative and undergo manual inspection of their passport, as required for international travel.CBP said it discards US citizens' photos within 12 hours of the identity verification process and enrolls noncitizens in the DHS Biometric Identity Management System, which retains the photos for up to 75 years.","From december 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-us citizens, including green card holders, at border points comes into effect.

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny stills believes ‘trump curse’ played a part in detroit’s late-season setback.

Nicholas J Fuentes, an American white nationalist known for his racist and sexist rants, has been after India for a very long time.He had several times used anti-India slurs at his podcasts, especially targeting Usha Vance, US Vice President's JD Vance's wife, and Vivek Ramaswamy In his recent podcast, while speaking about the Christmas celebration in the United States, said that no one celebrates the festival in Texas, Minneapolis and Seattle because there are all Indians, Somalians, and Asians.""What would America be without Christmas? Because pretty soon we're going to have a country of. A lot of people that don't celebrate Christmas aren't Christian, don't speak English, don't play baseball, don't eat hot dogs, don't eat apple pie. So imagine in 50 years, it's December 25th, and there. There are no Christmas trees. And it isn't Christmas in Dallas anymore or Frisco in Texas because it's all Indians. There is no Christmas in Minneapolis this year because it's all Somalians. There is no Christmas in Seattle anymore because it's all Asians,"" he said in the podcast.""And nobody's watching Christmas movies and nobody's going to visit a nativity scene and nobody's eating a turkey or a ham or singing Christmas carols and there are no Christmas lights or ornaments.Is that America? Nobody's even speaking English,"" he added.Speaking anti-India slurs, Fuentes asked that people are watching the soccer match on a tv, in a bar, in some hovel, eating rice with their hands, speaking Hindi to each other. Is that America? That look like any America you've ever heard of?On a report on X about the Donald Trump administration announcing “full suspension” of immigration and naturalisation for citizens of 19 countries, he commented, “Now do India”.These countries with full or partial travel restrictions include Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The US has intensified its crackdown on immigration after an Afghan national was accused of shooting one National Guard member and critically wounding another in Washington, DC.""I really appreciate the invitation. It's very gracious. I have said a lot of negative things about JD Vance. So for him to extend an invitation like that to me to have dinner, a traditional Indian dinner, with his family...it actually moved me. It actually touched me a little bit. I have been nothing but antagonistic to this guy, really unprovoked; I started the beef,"" Nick Fuentes said, suggesting that Indians eat s**t.""And so for him, in the spirit of the holiday and Christmas, for him to extend an invitation in public like that, to enjoy a traditional Indian dinner prepared by his wife with his family at the Naval Observatory, he is a better man than me. Credit where it is due,"" Fuentes said.Fuentes added that he would have to decline the invitation respectfully as he does not want to eat s**t. ""That's why we don't want them here,"" Fuentes said adding that he knows that Indian eat cow dung and they scratch their a** and prepare the food.Fuentes has used anti-India slurs against her multiple times. He in one of the podcasts called her J**t, which is a common slur used against Indian-origin people. In one of the podcasts, Fuentes used racist slurs, saying, ""Your guy (JD Vance) is literally a fat, gay, race traitor that married a J***.""Earlier, Fuentes launched his attack on Vance and his family after Vance joined Trump’s re-election campaign last month.Fuentes questioned Vance's loyalty to white identity, citing his marriage to an Indian woman and the name of their child, Vivek.Not only this, recently, the podcaster mocked the photo featuring JD Vance celebrating Thanksgiving with his Hindu wife Usha’s Indian-origin family.Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes mocked the Thanksgiving photo in a manner that many netizens deemed 'racist' on this year's Thanksgiving.Pointing at the image, Fuentes mocks its composition, claiming there are “two white people” and “24 Indian or East Asian people” dressed in what he calls “indigenous garb.” He sarcastically challenges viewers to “spot the differences,” using the moment to ridicule the family’s multicultural setting. Fuentes goes on to make a historically warped joke, insisting the first Thanksgiving involved Indigenous Americans, “not real Indians from India. ”He then takes a crude swipe at a red drink on the table, comparing it to street beverages in India prepared “with flies” and unsanitary handling. Using the photo as political ammunition, Fuentes argues that anyone considering Vance as a leader should simply look at the image, framing it as all they “need to know.”""This is not your home. And you know it's not your home. That's why you married an Indian and you had Indian kids, You gave them Indian names and you didn't assimilate, you didn't even adopt the religion of our country. And you go around telling us that we don't even have to speak English to be American. F**k you. You should go back to India where there's a lot more people like you. There's a billion and a half Indians in India and you don't have to worry about being called a J**t there because there's a billion and a half f**king J**ts in India and they won't call you one over there,"" Fuentes said in the recent podcast after his AmFest speech.""Go live there if it makes you feel uncomfortable. If you want to live here, give ounce and a shred of respect to the people that built this country. We're not asking anymore. We're telling you. And if you think now that you're gonna become the governor of Ohio, telling white people that you're as American as them, you got your anchor baby, birthright citizenship from your H1-B f****ng parents, you think you're gonna go around Ohio telling people that have been there since the civ or since the Revolutionary War, you're as American as them, you're now going to be their governor,"" he added.Over his Op-ed piece on New York Times, Fuetnes said, ""“Reminder that Vivek Ramaswamy is an actual anchor baby, so everything he says can be completely disregarded ...
