'Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan?': Chidambaram's remark on Pahalgam attackers stirs row; BJP hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-do-you-assume-that-they-came-from-pakistan-chidambarams-remark-on-pahalgam-attackers-stirs-row-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/122943979.cms,"P Chidambaram

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former home minister P Chidambaram has raised several questions about the Union government’s handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent Operation Sindoor In an interview with news outlet The Quint, Chidambaram said the government has not provided enough information and accused it of being unwilling to share key details.""Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?"" he asked, referring to the April 22 attack in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.Chidambaram also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information. ""We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that give you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?"" he said.Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Chidambaram responded, ""I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised...The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so. ""He also questioned the role of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the investigation. ""They are unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There's no evidence of that,"" he said.Chidambaram further added, ""They are also hiding the losses. I said it in a column that in a war, losses will occur on both sides. I understand that India would have suffered losses. Be upfront.""His comments come ahead of a scheduled debate in Parliament from Monday, where the ruling BJP and the Opposition are set to discuss the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at Chidambaram’s remarks, accusing the Congress of defending Pakistan. BJP leader Amit Malviya said, “Once again, the Congress rushes to give a clean chit to Pakistan — this time after the Pahalgam terror attack.""He added, ""Why is it that every time our forces confront Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, Congress leaders sound more like Islamabad’s defence lawyers than India’s opposition?”",P chidambaram has raised several questions about the union government’s handling of the pahalgam terror attack and subsequent operation sindoor.

Despite US warnings against participation, India hopes the conference will pave the way for concrete steps towards a two-state solution, advocating for an immediate ceasefire and hostage release.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: India is expected to participate in the UN high-level conference on peaceful settlement of the Palestine question and implementation of the 2-state solution, amid renewed international efforts to end the Gaza war. According to a list of delegates, 123 countries and agencies, including India, have signed up so far for the 3-day meeting beginning Monday that will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, both key strategic partners for India.India had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.The US had last month warned governments around the world against participating in the conference, saying it would mar ongoing efforts to end the war and free hostages, according to a diplomatic cable witnessed and reported by Reuters from Paris and Washington.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society.The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron this week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so. The US has condemned France’s decision and will skip the conference along with Israel.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council on the Palestinian question had taken note of the high-level conference. “While engaging in a forward-leaning and constructive manner, it is our hope that this Conference would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a two-State solution,” said the official, while strongly calling for a ceasefire to be put in place and seeking release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference. The level of India’s participation is still under consideration.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.","India is set to participate in the un high-level conference addressing the palestine question and the two-state solution, co-chaired by france and saudi arabia.

Government tells Air India to 'end backseat driving' in key departments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-tells-air-india-to-end-backseat-driving-in-key-departments/articleshow/122928239.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two key messages given by the Union aviation ministry to Tata Sons and Air India chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday were to ""end the culture of backseat driving"" in key AI departments with a direct bearing on safety, and that people holding posts in these core departments should have the final authority to take decisions and not be there merely to be fall guys when things go south, thereby protecting the alleged backseat drivers.Union minister Ram Mohan Naidu, secretary Samir Kumar Sinha and DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai had met Chandrasekaran on Friday to discuss steps to improve airline's safety. Chandrasekaran is learnt to have agreed to these suggestions.""Some departments, like safety, training, maintenance, engineering and 'integrated operation control centre' (IOCC), are key to ensuring overall operations take place safely. There were observations about some of these departments having a dichotomy in terms of someone being the post holder but someone else calling the shots. This needs to be resolved and we are hopeful the same will happen,"" said people in the know.After the June 12 AI 171 crash and subsequent minor incidents, the ministry has been holding high-level discussions with AI management headed by CEO Campbell Wilson. Three days of intense discussions culminated in the Chandrasekaran-Naidu-Sinha-Kidwai meeting on Friday.Following the minor incidents (AI 171 is being probed separately), AI post-holders were called to regulatory agencies concerned multiple times. With knowledge of AI's inside functioning, regulatory officials often ""felt bad"" for the ""scapegoats"" as those really calling the shots were not before them. ""Unko kyan bolein hum (What can we say to them),"" shrugged some officials who face this dilemma.On June 21, the DGCA had ordered the removal of three AI officials in charge of crew scheduling following ""lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements"", while warning it could go to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses in crew scheduling continued.One other thing that has been subtly pointed out to the management by officials following the June 12 crash is the airline's decision to keep items from planes that have crashed in the past (not AI 171) at its mega Gurgaon complex. Things like seats, instruments and flight data recorders have been kept on display. While it was perhaps meant to serve as a reminder of the need for safety, it is intensely disliked by a large number of employees.""We need positive energy and that place brings just negativity. We look at those seats and feel someone might have perished on them,"" said many employees.A senior govt official said: ""With Tatas and Singapore Airlines as its stakeholders, this is the best chance AI has to become the airline of JRD's dreams. Along with IndiGo, India today is looking at the possibility of two big Indian airlines, with some promising newbies that can also make it big some day. Govt will help Indian airlines, and that is what it is doing with AI handholding at this difficult time. Also, safety is govt's responsibility also in a highly regulated sector like aviation. ""All airlines have their own issues, and AI is not alone. ""Our attention on AI as of now is like a teacher paying extra attention to a promising student who might not be doing well for some reason,"" govt officials said, adding, ""It is time the well-run Singapore Airlines helps its JV come out of this huge crisis.""","After the june 12 ai 171 crash and subsequent minor incidents, the ministry has been holding high-level discussions with ai management.

'It Is Reasonable That...': Indian Envoy's Big Remark On Russia-India-China Troika Revival

‘Rudra brigades to have all combat elements, to be deployed together’

NEW DELHI: With the collusive military threat from China and Pakistan figuring high on India's radar screens, which was reinforced during Operation Sindoor , the Army is now setting up some new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades and 'Bhairav' light commando battalions for a greater and swifter offensive punch along the borders.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is also going in for 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and will also progressively equip all its 400-odd infantry battalions with drone platoons, against the backdrop of drone warfare upending all conventional military tactics in conflicts across the globe.Announcing these steps towards transforming and modernising the Army into ""a future-ready force"" during the Kargil Vijay Diwas in Drass on Saturday, General Upendra Dwivedi said India had delivered ""a well-planned, precise, and decisive response"" to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities to ""achieve a decisive victory"".We gave them (Pakistan) a chance for peace but they acted with cowardice. We then answered with only valour...Operation Sindoor is our resolve, our message, and our response,"" General Upendra Dwivedi said, warning Pakistan against misadventures in the future. ""With the unwavering trust of the countrymen and the strategic autonomy granted by the govt, the Army delivered a well-planned, precise, and decisive response.The Army chief's transformation announcements involve conversion of existing units and formations, without fresh troop accretions, a senior officer told TOI. Some of the existing over 250 single-arm brigades (over 3,000 soldiers each) are now being converted to all-arms ones with integration of fighting elements like infantry, mechanised infantry, armoured (tanks), artillery, Special Forces and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), which will be backed by customised logistics and combat support. The bulk of the existing brigades are from the infantry, with the others being from other arms like the artillery, armoured, mechanised infantry, air defence and the like. At present, these brigades, commanded by one-star officers or brigadiers, come together only during exercises or actual combat.""Now, the ones being converted to Rudra brigades, tailor-made for specific areas and tasks along the borders, will have all combat elements and be permanently deployed together in peace and war. Their re-structuring has been validated and approved. Two Rudra brigades have already been set up,"" the senior officer said.This is in tune with the long-pending proposal to restructure some Army formations into self-contained 'integrated battle groups (IBGs)', with 5,000-6,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units to be commanded by Major-Generals, which is yet to be approved by the govt.The new Bhairav light commando battalions will be in addition to the existing specially-trained and equipped 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) meant for covert warfare deep behind enemy lines.The plan is to raise at least 40-50 Bhairav battalions, drawn from existing infantry units and equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, in phases. Indicating that a few have already been raised, Gen Dwivedi said, ""The agile and lethal special forces Bhairav units are ready to surprise the enemy on the borders.""""Every infantry battalion will have drone platoons, while the firepower of the artillery has been multiplied many times through Divyastra batteries and loiter munitions batteries. The Army Air Defence (AAD) is being equipped with indigenous missile systems,"" he added.The AAD is slated to get two new regiments of the Akash Prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China for Rs 8,160 crore as well as three regiments of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems for Rs 36,000 crore (which includes three squadrons also for IAF), as was reported by TOI earlier.Akash Prime has the capability to intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a 25km range, it is 30km for the highly-mobile QRSAMs. They will add to India's existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.","Army to add more muscle on pakistan, china fronts.

Oppn plans to point to big terror attacks under ‘PM Modi’s watch’

GANGAIKONDA CHOLAPURAM/NEW DELHI: A day ahead of the parliamentary debate on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor , PM Narendra Modi on Sunday reasserted that the precision strikes on terror dens in Pakistan was India's message that there are no safe havens for terrorists and their masters.India places the highest priority on its national security and the operation has created a new awakening and a new self-confidence across the country, Modi said at an event in Tamil Nadu's Gangaikonda Cholapuram to honour Chola emperor Rajendra Chola.The world witnessed India's firm and decisive response to the threat against its sovereignty during Operation Sindoor and it has sent a clear message, there is no safe haven for terrorists and enemies of the nation, he said, setting the tone for the govt's response for the debate in Parliament, starting in Lok Sabha on Monday.The upcoming discussion in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the attack and the operation comes as a significant opportunity for the govt to reaffirm its strong stance on national security and counter-terrorism.The debate - after a first week of disruption of Parliament's Monsoon session - is likely to be a fiery one between the ruling alliance and the opposition as they prepare to lock horns over the issues steeped in national security and foreign policy imperatives.The two sides have consented to a marathon 16-hour debate in each House, which invariably stretches longer in practice. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh is likely to initiate the debate immediately after the question hour in Lok Sabha.Sources said home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will be speaking on the issues amid indications that the PM may make an intervention to convey his govt's ""robust"" stand against terrorism Leaders of opposition in LS and RS - Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge - may lead the charge against the govt along with Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav, besides a host of others. Congress , however, plans to attack the govt and particularly PM Modi on what BJP has claimed to be their calling card over a decade, and have used incessantly to target Congress over national security.More than Operation Sindoor, the opposition would be looking to hammer home that the country has been extremely unsafe from cross border threats, pointing to repeated big terror attacks under Modi's watch, from Uri to Pahalgam. This will also put Shah in the oppositions crosshairs.It is here that the opposition plans to undercut Modi's claim on national security. As has been seen since the terror attack, Congress and opposition have been pointing to the fact that the terrorists singled out the tourists by religion to execute them - a point that the opposition would have been reluctant to touch in the past for fear of polarisation.Congress ahead of the debate raised the issue of US President Donald Trump's claims of halting Operation Sindoor. Party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said since May 10, Trump has claimed ""26 times"" that he stopped the operation by ""threatening to cut off trade with India, and claimed that five fighter jets may have been shot down"".Ramesh on X said ""even though Congress had been demanding a special two-day session of Parliament immediately after Operation Sindoor was abruptly halted that demand was ignored. ""Nevertheless, better late than never,"" he said.","Parliament to debate operation sindoor; bjp, congress trade barbs ahead of clash.oppn plans to point to big terror attacks under ‘pm modi’s watch’ the two sides have consented to a marathon 16-hour debate in each house.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122940652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-689291,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Ahmedabad: The next time you see the armed forces on a parade ground, chances are high that you might hear ‘Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja,' the anthem of the Indian National Army, instead of ‘Colonel Bogey March' from 1914.Marking a cultural shift, the armed forces bands in 2022 embraced ‘Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo' during the Beating Retreat ceremony at Kartavya Path instead of the traditional ‘Abide with Me'. Aiming to take the initiative further is the newly inaugurated School of NCC and Police Martial Music Band (SNPMMB) at Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU). At the RRU school, officials aim to train the state police and central armed police forces (CAPFs) in newly created Indian tunes and compose new ones to ‘Indianize martial music. 'This is the first such school in a university setting in the country. Until now, bands in uniformed services were traditionally trained at special colleges and training schools.Senior RRU officials say the inspiration is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to make the music of India ‘not merely entertainment, but a vehicle for expression, connection, and identity'. The initiatives started in 2016 with the use of Indian tunes on major occasions, they added.Major (Retd) Ashok Kumar, principal of the school and former director of music at the Joint Services Training Institute, AEC Training College & Centre, Pachmarhi — which trains musicians for the armed forces — says that military bands are traditionally taught tunes that have been part of military tradition for over a century.""We have over 200 such tunes which are used for different functions and ceremonies. In the past decade or so, Indian experts have been creating several notations and tunes that are rooted in our culture. Our aim would be to both create new tunes for the bands of CAPF and police forces and to teach the newly created Indian tunes to these bands,"" says Major Kumar.Some examples of such tunes include ‘Veer Bharat' and ‘Amar Senani', composed by Indian military musicians. These are now played regularly at various state and armed forces events. ‘INS Vikrant,' ‘Veer Bharat,' ‘Desh Pukare,' 'Vayu Shakti,' ‘Hindustan,' and ‘Priyadarshini' are some more examples that reflect a rich Indian voice.Renjith G, senior instructor at SNPMMB, says the school is attempting to go a step further and create Indian raga and taal-based music in a global musical language. ""Our initiative is to create original Indian tunes rooted in the country's rich musical heritage and legacy,"" he adds.Dr Gaurav Singh Kushwah, in-charge director of the school, calls Indianizing martial music tradition in India a major initiative.""Our aim is to teach Indian tunes primarily to CAPF and state police bands. We aim to provide trained musicians to security forces who will learn the Indian tunes and notations,"" he says.The first batch of 40 musicians from Rajasthan Police Central Band is already being trained at the university. RRU officials say that the courses are designed both for in-service musicians and aspiring candidates at multiple levels – from diploma to PhD. Students will be taught Indian and Western musical systems, orchestration, band drill protocols, ceremonial etiquette, and theoretical training.The first initiative for the overhaul will be the formation of the National Music Classification Forum that will attempt to find Indian alternatives for Western bugle calls like Reveille, Last Post, and Retreat.","New school at rashtriya raksha university aims to 'indianize' martial music.

Trump Defied? Cambodia Accuses Thailand Of Fresh Attacks Amid Trump Truce Call

US president Donald Trump on Sunday once again brought up the India-Pakistan ceasefire, this time while speaking about the situation between Thailand and Cambodia.Trump said the US does a lot of trade with both Thailand and Cambodia. He claimed he personally called the prime ministers of both countries and warned them that no trade deal would move forward unless they stopped the fighting.“This should be an easy one for me because I settled India and Pakistan,” Trump said, repeating a claim he has made several times in the past. “By the time I got off the call, I think they want to settle now.”He added that India and Pakistan were “really getting ready to go at it” back when he intervened. “If I can use trade to settle wars, then it’s my honour,” he said.","Trump said the us does a lot of trade with both thailand and cambodia.

Unlike most regional parties that have focused on restoring statehood following the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, PDP has consistently called for full restoration of the article — and now appears intent on re-centring the political discourse around its self-rule narrative, sources said.Delivering the official message this year was Irtiqa Mufti, US-educated eldest daughter of party president Mehbooba Mufti . Irtiqa, who edits PDP’s monthly mouthpiece Speak Up, said the party’s foundation day was a moment to “reflect on the idea that gave birth to PDP”.“In 1999, my grandfather Mufti Mohammad Sayeed founded this party with the belief that the people of J&K deserve dignity, dialogue, and democratic rights,” she said in her widely circulated message.Her appearance has fuelled speculation of her entry into politics, especially as her younger sister Iltija Mufti has been a prominent voice since 2019. However, PDP spokesperson Mohit Bhan said Irtiqa’s current role remains within the party’s communications team.Irtiqa has gradually stepped into the public sphere over the past few months, mirroring the political ascent once made by Iltija.

Among the restricted locations are Phu Chong-Na Yoi National Park, Prasat Ta Muen Thom, and Khao Phra Wihan National Park. Travellers were urged to contact local TAT offices for further updates and assistance.More than 100,000 people have already fled the bloodiest border fighting in over a decade, Thai authorities confirmed. The clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have involved tanks, jet fighters, and artillery, leaving at least 15 people dead 14 civilians and one Thai soldier and injuring 46, including 15 soldiers.Nearly 300 temporary shelters have been set up across four Thai border provinces to house the displaced.Cambodian authorities have not released their own casualty figures, but shelling has been reported in the town of Samraong, just 20 kilometres from the border. “We are scared because they began shooting again at about 6:00 am,” a local man told AFP, as his family fled to a nearby Buddhist temple.Despite calls for calm from Asean Chair and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, hostilities resumed early Friday. The Thai army accused Cambodian forces of launching attacks with BM-21 rocket systems, prompting retaliatory strikes.The fighting stems from a decades-long border dispute, with the current flare-up beginning in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed.

'Wrong Bodies' Of Ahmedabad Air India Crash Victims Sent to Families: India Dismisses UK Media Claim

NEW DELHI: Brainstorming is on at the highest levels of Tata Group and the aviation ministry to put Air India back on track after the spate of bad news led by the deadly AI 171 crash and regulatory actions in past few months. Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Friday met Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu and aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha. The meeting came after three days of detailed discussions between the airline management led by CEO Campbell Wilson and officials led by the secretary that have led to concrete suggestions emerging from the same.“We have discussed all issues threadbare including those related to maintenance, leadership and communications. Something positive will come out of this. India needs strong carriers and govt will support airlines wherever needed. The results will hopefully be visible in coming days once the suggestions are implemented,” said people in the know. One such meeting went on till well after 10 pm earlier this week.Sources say Chandrasekaran informed govt about the steps being taken by the airline post AI 171 crash and some recent incidents o bolster safety.“Basically, it was informed how AI plans to win back flyers’ confidence,” they said.It is learnt the areas identified during the recent meetings for immediate attention include airworthiness, engineering and maintenance. A lack of spares, for instance, often forces aircraft to fly under “minimum equipment list” (MEL) for a long time. MEL is a list that conditionally allows aircraft to be used with some equipment inoperative with the condition that the same does not impact safety and that it would be replaced within a certain timeframe.The main issue, say multiple people involved in the exercise, is of culture. “Vistara was merged into AI last Nov, ideally it should have been the other way round. But that is done. Both the airlines have a very different culture and AI is now facing post-merger issues. During the meetings, solutions were suggested. The main issue is not operations but it is about engineering and maintenance,” they said.For some time, having the better run Singapore Airlines (SIA) — which has 25.1% stake in AI with the rest with the Tatas — play a more visible handholding may be considered. It’s not about the image of AI alone, which has taken a beating, but also the Maharaja’s new promoters — Tatas and SIA.The focus has to be on ensuring 100% safety and not growing rapidly. AI has cut flights post the Ahmedabad crash. “The culture has to change to safety first not just for AI but all airlines. Sacrifice growth but ensure safety. That has to be the firm message across the board,” they said.The example being cited is of Boeing which has been through a rollercoaster in recent years from being a “marvellous organisation once celebrated for engineering excellence” to an airline cutting corners for commercial reasons when it tried to counter competitor Airbus’ best-seller A320NEO planes with a hurriedly made B737 MAX. After two MAX crashes in quick succession, Boeing is now trying hard to win back customer airlines’ and flyers’ faith by making safer planes.",Tata sons chairman n chandrasekaran met union aviation minister ram mohan naidu and aviation secretary samir kumar sinha.

Political fallout and historical tensions





A deadly border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand has entered its fourth consecutive day, with both nations exchanging heavy artillery fire and reporting mounting civilian and military casualties.The hostilities, the worst in over a decade, have prompted international concern and intervention from US President Donald Trump , who urged both sides to agree to a ceasefire.The clashes, sparked by a long-running dispute over ancient temple sites and aggravated by political tensions, have already killed at least 33 people and displaced more than 150,000 along the heavily contested 800-kilometre border.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Sunday that his government was open to discussing a ceasefire and welcomed US efforts to mediate.“Just spoke to the Prime Minister of Cambodia relative to stopping the War with Thailand. I am calling the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand, right now, to likewise request a Ceasefire, and END to the War, which is currently raging,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hun Manet confirmed that Cambodia’s foreign minister would coordinate directly with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and work with Thailand to pursue dialogue, according to AFP.However, he also warned Bangkok against backtracking on any agreement.Thailand, meanwhile, said late Saturday that it “agrees in principle” to a ceasefire and the start of “bilateral dialogue” aimed at ending the violence. “Thailand agrees in principle to have a ceasefire in place,” the foreign ministry stated in a post on X.The Thai foreign ministry also confirmed the phone call between Trump and Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, adding: “Thailand would like to see sincere intention from the Cambodian side.”Fighting spreads to coastline as casualties mountIt further said Phumtham requested Trump to “convey to the Cambodian side that Thailand wants to convene a bilateral dialogue as soon as possible to bring forth measures and procedures for the ceasefire and the eventual peaceful resolution of the conflict.”Despite growing calls for peace, hostilities have continued. Early Saturday, fighting erupted along the countries’ coastal regions near the Gulf of Thailand, approximately 250 kilometres southwest of the main conflict zone.Cambodia’s defence ministry reported that 13 people- including eight civilians and five soldiers- had been killed on their side, with 71 injured. Thai officials said 13 civilians and seven soldiers had died in their territory.AFP journalists stationed in Samraong, a Cambodian town 20 kilometres from the conflict zone, reported hearing the consistent sound of artillery since dawn on Sunday.The conflict has forced more than 138,000 people to flee Thailand’s border regions and displaced over 35,000 inside Cambodia.“It feels like I'm escaping a war zone,” said 76-year-old Samlee Sornchai, sheltering at a temple in the Thai town of Kanthararom after fleeing his farm near the frontline, told AFP.Each side has blamed the other for escalating the violence. Cambodia accused Thailand of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into Pursat province, while Thailand alleged that Cambodia targeted civilian infrastructure, including a hospital. Cambodia has also claimed Thai forces used cluster munitions, a charge Thailand denies.Following an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to immediately cease hostilities.“The Secretary-General condemns the tragic and unnecessary loss of lives, injuries to civilians and the damage to homes and infrastructure on both sides,” said his deputy spokesman Farhan Haq.He added that Guterres remained “deeply concerned” and urged both governments to hold talks for a peaceful solution.The fighting has revived long-simmering disputes over territory and ancient temples along the rugged, jungle-covered border. A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the issue temporarily, but tensions flared again in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a skirmish, followed by two Thai soldiers losing limbs in landmine blasts in July.Tensions quickly escalated, reviving a century-old dispute over the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, which both nations claim. Though the International Court of Justice ruled in 1962- and reaffirmed in 2013- that the temple and surrounding land belong to Cambodia, Thailand continues to contest a 4.6 sq km area around it, making the site a persistent flashpoint.",Cambodia open to ceasefire talks as trump steps in too.
