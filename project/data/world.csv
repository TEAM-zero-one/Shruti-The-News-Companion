Gold price prediction today: Amidst ongoing US-China trade deal talks, gold prices are likely to continue fluctuating, with geo-political uncertainties adding to volatility. Where are gold prices headed in the short-term and what are the factors that investors need to watch out for?Top trade deputies of the US and China began their talks in London on Monday. Gold gained on Monday on a weaker US Dollar. MCX August gold contract was at Rs 97200, up 0.16% on the day.Earlier, spot gold prices fell 1.25% to close at $3310 on Friday as the US non-farm payroll report (May) came in somewhat better than expected, though details were not so encouraging.Easing US-China trade tensions pressurized the yellow metal further. Despite falling for two straight days on June 5 and June 6, the metal closed nearly 0.63% higher on a weekly basis in the week ending June 6.The metal rose to $3403 on June 5 --highest since May 8- as traders piled into the metal on safe haven demand as US-China tensions escalated.US Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick and US Trade Representative Greer met a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng Monday at London's Lancaster House. Presence of high-profile officials in Trump's Team reflects willingness of the US administration to allow some relaxations in the US exports to China, which may include technical supplies, jet engine parts, etc. China, in turn, is expected to ease rare earth exports to the US.Total known global gold ETF holdings stood at 88.394MOz as of June 6. ETF holdings witnessed net inflows for the second consecutive week following net outflows for five straight weeks. ETF holdings are up around 6.70% YTD.China's inflation data released Monday showed that China's CPI (May) declined 0.1% y-o-y vs the forecast of -0.2%. It was the fourth straight monthly decline as the Chinese economy continues to struggle with sluggish demand amid a raging trade war. China’s factory deflation continued for the 32nd straight month as PPI (May) declined 3.3% y-o-y as against the estimate of 3.2% and 2.7% decline in April. The deflation threat will continue to linger unless consumer demand remains sluggish.China's exports slowed from 8.1% y-o-y in April to 4.8% y-o-y (forecast 6%) in May as shipments to the US declined 34% y-o-y, worse than a 21% decline registered in April. Chinese imports dipped 3.4% y-o-y due to trade uncertainty as against the forecast of a decline of 0.8%.The US non-farm report (May) released Friday was somewhat better-than-expected as US employers added 139K jobs Vs the forecast of 126K jobs, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Average hourly earnings m-o-m and y-o-y rose 0.4% and 3.9% respectively Vs the respective estimates of 0.3% (prior 0.2%) and 3.7% (prior 3.9%). However, two-month payroll net revision showed a decline of 95K jobs as labor force participation rate slid from 62.6% to 52.4%. The household survey reflected a weakening job market. Even as the population increased by 188k, the labor force dropped by 625k. Thus, even though employment fell by 696k, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.20%.Traders will closely monitor US CPI (May) and PPI (May) data to be released on June 11 and June 12 respectively for clues to the Fed rate cut path.The US Dollar Index, at the time of writing, was seen at 98.95, down nearly 0.24% on the day. The Index fell 0.14% in the week ending June 6. Ten-year and 30-year US yields were a tad lower at 4.48% and 4.95% respectively.Money managers increased their net bullish gold bets to a seven-week high in the week ending June 3.China's gold reserves were up for the seventh consecutive month as PBoC bought around 2 tons of gold in May. China's gold holdings reached 73.80 MOz at the end of May.The lingering deflation threat to China’s economy, positive ETF inflows and not so strong US non-farm payroll report (May) are positive factors for the yellow metal. However, in the near-term, the metal is expected to take its clues from the ongoing US-China trade talks in London. Positive outcomes from the talks will weigh on the shiny metal. In that case, gold may fall to as low as $3260 (Rs 95,000). Interim support is at $3292 (Rs 96,000). Resistance is at $3365 (Rs 98,000)/$3405 (Rs 99,200).In all the possibility, there may be some tentative positive developments in the trade deal talks. In that case, gold may decline to test the support at $3292. However, full resolution of all the trade related issues looks to be elusive for the time being. Nonetheless, traders need to take cognizance of the ongoing US-China trade deal talks. In the meantime, a light sell position can be initiated with due risk management in place.","Gold gained on monday on a weaker us dollar.

'Is This Your Achievement?': Oppn Trashes Development Claims As BJP Celebrates 11 Years Of Modi Govt

Poll Do you believe the position of Deputy Speaker should be filled promptly? Yes, it's essential for democracy No, it's not a priority right now

NEW DELHI: Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who is also the Rajya Sabha leader of opposition, wrote to PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker.Highlighting the vacant status of the position for the two consecutive Lok Sabha terms, Kharge said this ""does not augur well for India's democratic polity and is also in violation of well-laid-out provisions of the Constitution"".""From the First to the Sixteenth Lok Sabha, every House has had a Deputy Speaker. By and large, it has been a well-established convention to appoint the Deputy Speaker from among the members of the principal opposition party,"" Kharge wrote on X with a letter he wrote to the PM.He further wrote: ""No Deputy Speaker was elected during the Seventeenth Lok Sabha, and this concerning precedent continues in the ongoing Eighteenth Lok Sabha.""The Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha is a key constitutional position in India’s lower house of Parliament.The Deputy Speaker is elected by the members of the Lok Sabha, usually from among themselves, soon after the Speaker is elected. The primary role of the Deputy Speaker is to preside over the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in the absence of the Speaker and to ensure the smooth conduct of the House. The Deputy Speaker has the same powers as the Speaker when presiding, including maintaining order, deciding on points of order, and managing debates.Importantly, the Deputy Speaker is expected to function in a non-partisan manner, similar to the Speaker, despite being elected from a political party. Traditionally, this post is often offered to a member of the opposition or another party to maintain a balance, although this is not mandated by the Constitution.The position is significant for upholding the parliamentary process and ensuring continuity in the functioning of the Lok Sabha when the Speaker is unavailable.The last Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha in India was M. Thambi Durai from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He served as the Deputy Speaker during the 16th Lok Sabha (2014–2019).","Mallikarjun kharge wrote to pm narendra modi on tuesday, urging him to hold the election of the lok sabha deputy speaker.

NEW DELHI: Continuing with the high tempo of military exercises with other countries after last month’s hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , India has now conducted anti-submarine operations with the UK in the northern Arabian Sea, undertaken Special Forces drills with the US and is set for trilateral wargames in Mongolia.The Navy deployed stealth frigate INS Tabar, a Kalvari-class submarine and a long-range maritime patrol P-8I aircraft for the tactical exercise with an aircraft carrier strike group of the UK, which included HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Richmond, on June 9-10.India had forward deployed several frontline warships and submarines led by aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, with its MiG-29K fighters, in a dissuasive deterrent posture in the northern Arabian Sea when the IAF and Army had launched deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK on May 7. The deployment had bottled up the Pak Navy within its own shores in a defensive mode.The IAF’s Garud commandos, in turn, conducted intensive combat drills with their counterparts from the USAF at different locations in north India from May 26 to June 10, in the first-ever such Special Forces exercise called “Tiger Claw”.“The exercise aimed at expanding partnerships, mutual exchange of best practices in special operations, and joint training between the two air forces to develop interoperability,” an officer said.An Army contingent of Kumaon Regiment soldiers and some other units, including a woman officer and two women soldiers, also reached Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Wednesday to take part in the “Khaan Quest” exercise, with the US as the third participant in the drills from June 14 to 28.“The exercise’s aim is to prepare Indian armed forces for peacekeeping missions while operating in a multinational environment, thereby increasing interoperability and military readiness in peace,” an officer said.","India has conducted anti-submarine operations with the uk in the northern arabian sea.

NEW DELHI: Amid apparent differences with the Trump administration over critical issues like Pakistan's support to cross border terrorism, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said that India's aim is to advance the relationship with the US as it serves India's interests.

And the countries that were most supportive of that? Western countries,"" he said.'If those same countries - who were evasive or reticent then - now say 'let's have a great conversation about international principles', I think I'm justified in asking them to reflect on their own past,"" added Jaishankar.Asked about India's ties with China, the minister recalled his meetings with several European companies in India that have chosen to set up there specifically to de-risk their supply chains.""Many companies are becoming increasingly careful about where they locate their data - they'd rather place it somewhere secure and trustworthy than simply go for efficiency.

There was no substantial outcome. After the delegation returned, a report was submitted to the Prime Minister, but no clear achievement was mentioned.”“Our objective was to isolate Pakistan on the global stage and expose its role in terrorism. But that mission was not fulfilled. Ironically, Pakistan still enjoys substantial international support — it has been made co-chair in United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and chairs a US-formed committee to monitor the Taliban in Afghanistan. Pakistan also got funds from the World Bank and other global institutions like the IMF,” the Congress MP said.“We sent this delegation with the hope of creating international pressure on Pakistan, but nothing has changed. The exercise turned out to be ceremonial rather than strategic,"" he told news agency IANS.The Congress also reacted strongly to the remarks of US Army General Michael Kurilla, Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM) who said that the United States has to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India, and noted that it cannot be a ""binary switch"" where Washington cannot have ties with Islamabad if it has relations with New Delhi.Kurilla made the comments during a testimony before the US House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.In his remarks, Kurilla said, ""We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has. ISIS Khorasan (ISIS K) is perhaps one of the most active in trying to do external plots globally to include against the homeland.

NFL Rumors: Cleveland Browns could trade Rookie QB Dillon Gabriel in strategic quarterback move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-cleveland-browns-could-trade-rookie-qb-dillon-gabriel-in-strategic-quarterback-move/articleshow/121785459.cms,"Browns may trade rookie QB Dillon Gabriel to clear up roster (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Dillon Gabriel might be the odd man out





The Cleveland Browns are staring down one of the most intriguing quarterback dilemmas of the 2025 NFL offseason. With veteran names like Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett already in the mix, and two freshly drafted prospects—Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders—added to the fold, the Browns are overloaded at the game’s most important position. And now, all signs point to one reality: someone’s got to go.While the Browns selected Dillon Gabriel nearly 50 picks ahead of Shedeur Sanders in this year’s draft, draft order doesn’t always translate to roster security. As camps approach, speculation is growing that Cleveland may look to trade Gabriel rather than risk exposing him to waivers where another team would likely scoop him up for nothing.The Browns' front office is reportedly weighing the possibility of flipping Gabriel in a pre-season deal. Doing so would not only free up a roster spot but also help recoup value for a player who may not crack the final depth chart. With most NFL teams desperate for even a serviceable backup, Gabriel could fetch interest from franchises looking to bolster their QB room.But there's more at play than just numbers. Gabriel brings a dual-threat edge that makes him appealing to modern offenses. However, Shedeur Sanders brings buzz, branding, and the undeniable “star power” that makes it harder for a team to move on from him regardless of draft position.Letting either rookie walk is risky. Both have developmental upside, and both could turn into long-term assets. But keeping four quarterbacks simply isn’t realistic in today’s NFL. Joe Flacco showed his value down the stretch last season, and Kenny Pickett still holds trade value of his own, though less than what a recent rookie might command.Also Read: Chiefs eye future beyond Travis Kelce with potential trade for Raiders’ Michael Mayer If the Browns don’t act fast, they risk losing one of their young QBs to waivers with nothing in return. Trading Gabriel could be a calculated move not just to maintain control, but to protect long-term flexibility in the quarterback room. The Browns have made quarterback mistakes before. This one, they can’t afford to screw up.","Browns may trade rookie qb dillon gabriel to clear up roster. Gabriel brings a dual-threat edge that makes him appealing to modern offenses.

Houthi Revenge Hits Israel: Ballistic Missile Breaks Mid-Air, IDF Scrambles 7 Interceptors | Watch





A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on Tuesday evening.The missile was intercepted by Israeli air defenses, preventing a potential mass casualty event instigated by Iranian-backed terrorists, claimed the Israeli war room. ""A Houthi ballistic missile launched at Israeli civilians nearly hit a civilian plane. If not for the competence of Israeli air defenses, there could have been a mass casualty event caused by Iranian-backed terrorists,"" it said in a post on X, while sharing a video.In the video, the plane can be seen flying away just moments before the missiles were intercepted.The Israeli military stated that the missiles fired from Yemen, were intercepted after breaking into multiple fragments upon impact with an interceptor.Consequently, the Israeli Air Force deployed additional interceptors to neutralise the debris. At least seven interceptors were launched during the operation. In previous instances, partially intercepted Houthi missiles have resulted in casualties when intact warheads fell to the ground. The Houthis, an Iran-backed group, claimed responsibility for the attack, announcing the launch of two ballistic missiles targeting Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel.According to a military official quoted by The Times of Israel, the second missile either fell short or disintegrated in the air, consistent with several Houthi projectiles in recent weeks.The missile attack triggered sirens shortly before 8 pm across central Israel, the Jerusalem area, southern West Bank settlements, and selected regions in southern Israel. Two minutes prior to the sirens, an early warning was sent to residents through push notifications on their phones, alerting them to the long-range missile threat.The Israel Defence Forces issued a statement regarding the incoming attack approximately five minutes before the sirens activated. No injuries were reported from the attack. Debris from the intercepted missile and interceptors landed near Jerusalem and in the West Bank, causing no significant damage.Then on Tuesday morning, the Israeli Navy conducted its first-ever strike on Yemen by destroying infrastructure at the Hodeida port. The operation involved two guided missiles launched from advanced Sa’ar 6-class corvettes positioned hundreds of kilometres away. This action marked the 11th Israeli strike against the Houthis since the conflict began, with the previous ten strikes executed by the Air Force.The Houthis, whose slogan proclaims “Death to America, Death to Israel, [and] a Curse on the Jews,” initiated attacks on Israel and maritime traffic in November 2023, a month following the October 7 Hamas massacre. The group ceased its attacks when a ceasefire was established between Israel and Hamas in January 2025. By that time, the Houthis had launched over 40 ballistic missiles and numerous drones and cruise missiles at Israel, including one that caused civilian casualties in Tel Aviv in July, triggering Israel’s initial strike in Yemen.Since March 18, when the Israel Defence Forces resumed their offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after a temporary ceasefire, the Houthis have launched 48 ballistic missiles and at least 11 drones at Israel, with several of the missiles failing to reach their targets.","Houthi ballistic missile launched at israeli civilians nearly struck a civilian plane on tuesday evening. The missile was intercepted by israeli air defenses, preventing a potential mass casualty event instigated by iranian-backed terrorists. The houthis, an iran-backed group, claimed responsibility for the attack.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121782639,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24000,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

FBI director Kash Patel , an Indian-origin official leading the agency, announced Tuesday the extradition of Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada to the United States on terrorism charges.Khan is accused of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York.“Major news… earlier this afternoon, Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a Pakistani citizen residing in Canada, was extradited to the United States on charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and attempting to commit acts of terrorism,” Patel wrote on X.According to the FBI, Khan allegedly planned to travel from Canada to New York and carry out a mass shooting on October 7, 2024 — the anniversary of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel — in support of ISIS. He was arrested by Canadian authorities on September 4, 2024, before the attack could be executed.“Thankfully, the great work of FBI teams and our partners exposed those plans and shut them down,” Patel said. “He has now arrived in the U.S. and will face American justice.”Calling it a reminder of the “constant threat of terrorism facing every corner of the world,” Patel also highlighted the “disturbing rise in threats against our Jewish communities.”He credited multiple FBI field offices, including in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, for their role in the operation.Though the announcement came from Indian-origin Patel, many in India have long remained skeptic on the United States for allegedly providing safe haven to Pakistan-backed terrorists. However, under the Trump administration, Washington’s stance appears to be shifting.Just after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the White House, President Donald Trump approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, to India.Rana was handed over in April to face trial for his role in the attacks.Still, another central figure in the case, David Headley, remains imprisoned in the United States.President Trump also strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of at least 26 people. Expressing solidarity, he said, “PM Modi and the incredible people of India have our full support and deepest sympathies.”","Fbi director kash patel announced tuesday the extradition of muhammad shahzeb khan, a pakistani citizen residing in canada.

Who is Christy Walton? Why has she sponsored an anti-Trump advertisement ?







Amid a major 'boycott' call over the advertisement that the company's heiress gave on NYT, asking Americans to take part in the protest against Donald Trump on his birthday on June 14, Walmart VP Dan Bartlett said that advertisements were in no way connected to Walmart.""We condemn violence, including when it’s directed towards law enforcement, and the damaging of property.

How Dave Portney’s vote is a reflection of his personal beliefs

Dave Portnoy on Trump, the 'manosphere' and 'Barstool conservatism' | Morning Edition | NPR

""How Many Jews Have To DIE?"" - Barstool’s Dave Portnoy EXPLODES Over Jew Joke BACKLASH





When Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says he cast his vote for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, it resonated far beyond a simple political preference—it signaled deeper concerns about today’s cultural landscape. Portnoy, a self-made media mogul and known pizza critic, framed his choice not as wholehearted support for Trump, but as a statement against “woke politics” and what he sees as the denigration of hard-working men. His explanation has sparked both surprise and reflection, prompting a closer look at how modern cultural battles intertwine with political expression. This article takes a fresh perspective: exploring Portnoy’s vote as a cultural outlook, rooted in identity, values, and a growing movement known as “Barstool conservatism.”Portnoy shared his political rationale in a revealing NPR interview, stating, “It’s more an indictment of, I would say, the Democrats (than an) endorsement of Trump’s politics” . He added that he’s “pro-choice,” noting people assume that isn’t “a typical bro standpoint” . His remarks reflect frustration with left-leaning “blunt talk,” overemphasis on identity issues, and what he perceives as public shaming of men.Portnoy also critiqued Democrats’ messaging, saying their moral certainty alienates many, including hard-working independent men.This candid stance places him squarely in what’s become known as Barstool conservatism, a cultural-political identity championing libertarian views, male-centric pop culture, anti-woke attitudes, and pro-Trump leanings. Portnoy’s loyal fanbase—young, outspoken, and looking for authenticity—has gravitated toward this balance of counterculture and freedom.Yet, Portnoy’s support has its limits. He didn’t shy from criticizing President Trump’s tariff decisions, admitting losses up to $20 million, calling the market turbulence “tariff city”. Still, he remains impartial on policy, valuing governmental consistency and directness.Rooted in humble beginnings, Portnoy’s rise from Swampscott to Boston entrepreneur speaks to a self-made ethos. Barstool Sports began in 2003 as a free four-page zine, evolving into a digital media empire known for brash honesty and unapologetic content.Dave Portnoy’s vote for Trump offers more than a political headline—it exposes a cultural divide, highlighting a longing for no-nonsense values, work ethic, and pride untainted by public scorn. Whether you agree with his method or not, his stance taps into a powerful sentiment: many feel talked down to and overlooked. As the lines between culture, media, and politics blur, Portnoy’s act underscores the importance of understanding why people vote for what they perceive as an outlet, not just a candidate. In our charged era, this vote reminds us of one truth: identity, respect, and voice matter. And for many, they matter more than platform alone.","Barstool sports founder dave portnoy says he cast his vote for donald trump in the 2024 election.

US President Donald Trump has ordered to pull out troops from from the potentially ""dangerous"" Middle East on Wednesday as nuclear negotiations appear to stall and regional instability looms. The State Department on Wednesday ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad, citing a commitment “to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad.” The embassy had already been operating with limited staff.""Well they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. We've given notice to move out and we'll see what happens."" Trump said, adding that ""they can't have a nuclear weapon, very simple. We're not going to allow that.""Additionally, the State Department is authorising the optional departure of nonessential personnel and family members from diplomatic posts in Bahrain and Kuwait. The US military is also following suit, with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth approving the voluntary departure of military dependents from multiple locations across the region. US Central Command said it is “monitoring the developing tension.”White House spokesperson Anna Kelly noted that the decisions came after a regular review of American personnel abroad. “This decision was made as a result of a recent review,” she said.The move comes as efforts to revive the stalled US-Iran nuclear negotiations face fresh setbacks. Talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief have reportedly reached a deadlock, with the next round—originally planned for this weekend in Oman—now in doubt. Two US officials, speaking anonymously, said it was increasingly unlikely the talks would go ahead.President Donald Trump offered a pessimistic assessment in a recent interview, saying he is “getting more and more less confident about” reaching a deal. “They seem to be delaying, and I think that's a shame,” he told the New York Post podcast Pod Force One.Iran, meanwhile, rejected threats of force. “Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, and US militarism only fuels instability,” its mission to the UN wrote online. Defence Minister Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh added that if war were imposed, “the opponent's casualties will certainly be more than ours,” warning the US that its regional bases “are within our reach.”Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors is considering a censure resolution against Iran, which could trigger the reimposition of UN sanctions under the still-active 2015 nuclear deal. The US withdrew from that deal during Trump’s first term.Amid the growing risk of conflict, the UK’s Maritime Trade Operations Centre warned ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman—areas where Iran has previously seized or attacked vessels.",The state department ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the us embassy in baghdad.

The

Trump Card

is coming!

What the card promises — and what it doesn’t

A replacement for EB-5?

Major tax advantage for card holders

The much-hyped “Trump Card” is now officially open for registration, offering wealthy foreigners a chance to join a waiting list.US President Donald Trump describes it as a premium route toward US citizenship, for a hefty $5 million price tag.The official website, TrumpCard.gov, features an image of the shiny gold-coloured card, complete with Trump’s photo, signature and name. The form asks for basic details like name, email, region of origin, and whether the applicant is applying as an individual or a business.Trump announced the launch on his social media platform Truth Social, “For five million $DOLLARS, The Trump Card is coming! Thousands have been calling and asking how they can sign up to ride a beautiful road in gaining access to the greatest country and market anywhere in the world.”“The waiting list is now open,” he added.The website lists eight regions for applicants to choose from: Europe, Asia (including the Middle East), North America, Oceania, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Africa.Above the details, the site ensures that applicants will be notified when access opens: ‘Enter your information below to be notified the moment access opens.’Trump claims the card offers a “path to citizenship,” but he has clarified that it does not guarantee immediate entry or naturalisation. “It’s somewhat like a green card , but at a higher level of sophistication,” the POTUS has claimed.The Trump administration insists the new card does not require approval from Congress, as it doesn’t provide citizenship outright. White House officials have said more information will be released soon, reports USA Today.Under the existing US naturalisation system, immigrants must typically be lawful permanent residents for at least five years, meet age and language criteria, and have a clean record.Trump first proposed the Trump Card earlier this year as a replacement for the EB-5 investor visa programme, which grants green cards to foreigners who invest between $800,000 and $1.05 million into US job-creating projects. The EB-5 programme has long suffered from backlogs and accusations of fraud.“Wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card,” Trump said in February. “They'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful, and they'll be spending a lot of money, and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people.”He added, “It’s a road to citizenship for people and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”One of the key selling points of the Trump Card appears to be its potential tax benefits. Trump has suggested that gold card buyers would only be taxed on their US earnings, unlike green card holders, who are taxed on worldwide income. This is likely to appeal to many high-net-worth individuals who have avoided relocating to the US due to its global tax obligations.Trump Card does not seem to require applicants to create US-based jobs or launch businesses, unlike the EB-5 visa programme. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has claimed that 1,000 cards were sold in a single day, even though the programme has yet to officially launch. According to Lutnick, some 37 million people worldwide could afford the Trump Card.Trump has claimed he was the first to purchase the Trump Card himself. “I had no idea who would be the second,” he said. However, the programme is not designed for American citizens.","The much-hyped ‘trump card’ is now officially open for registration.

: US President Donald Trump claimed on Wednesday that Washington and Beijing have a ""done deal"" on trade amid broad skepticism given his penchant for verbal overreach and a cautious statement from China which only said a ""framework "" had been reached to implement a ""consensus"" reached between the two sides.""Our deal with China is done, subject to final approval with President Xi and me,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social account on Wednesday morning following two days of talks in London between negotiators, inviting cynical response from skeptics who likened the announcement to a runner saying, ""I just completed the Marathon, subject to running the last 10miles successfully.""The Chinese side left no doubt that a full deal was still a work in progress and the two leaders were yet to sign off on it, saying while the talks in London were “professional, rational, in-depth and candid,” the two sides have, ""in principle, reached a framework for implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state during the phone call on June 5th and the consensus reached at the Geneva meeting.""That consensus centered largely on a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs the two countries had imposed on each other. The Chinese side did not disclose any progress made in London.But Trump announced that ""full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China"" and ""Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities (which has always been good with me!""""WE ARE GETTING A TOTAL OF 55% TARIFFS, CHINA IS GETTING 10%.RELATIONSHIP IS EXCELLENT! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!"" he concluded in his customary all-caps post.The two sides have engaged in bruising negotiations over the past fortnight, included the in-person meeting in London, leveraging each others' critical stranglehold on the other to reach a broader trade deal. While China shut off supply of critical rare earths required for US weapons and automobile advances in response to Trump's tariff hike, Washington responded by curtailing exports of American products and technology, including chemicals, airplane parts and software, while threatening to bar Chinese students from enrolling in the US.Which side is backing down is hard to say. While Trump's MAGA flock insists that China had ""bent its knee"" before their great dealmakers, Trump critics said he has had to retreat in the trade war he initiated, and the matter is far from settled absent a full readout of the talks and the prospective deal, with details.The skepticism stems from Trump's bombastic claims on a range of topics, from stopping the Russia-Ukraine war on ""Day One"" to promise of a ""gold card"" in two weeks, to claims of having brought about truce between India and Pakistan, all of which have turned out to be premature, hollow, or false.US markets appeared to acknowledge the skepticism, barely budging despite the announcement.","Us president donald trump claimed on wednesday that washington and beijing have a ""done deal"" on trade amid broad skepticism.

Dr Rupa Marya, an Indian-American professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, has sued the university for suspending her for her social media posts about Israel's war in Gaza. Marya was placed on leave in September 2024 by the university in a statement that did not name Marya but said that it condemns ""tired and racist conspiracy theory"" that ""Zionist doctors were a threat to Arab, Palestinian, South Asian, Muslim and Black patients, as well as the US healthcare system.""Marya filed a lawsuit saying that she received rape and death threats and repeated harassment and threats because of her posts. She said suspending her violated her right to free speech. ""We all need to urgently speak up against these kinds of attacks on our basic rights to advocate for justice, and we expect the court will agree with us that Dr Marya’s rights have been violated and must be remedied,"" the lawsuit said.“As a medical doctor, American citizen and as a person of south Asian descent raised in the Sikh religious tradition, Dr Marya has long been concerned about American foreign policy, including in the Middle East and the issues surrounding the conflict between Israel and Palestine,”it said.In a September 2024 post, Marya wrote that her students were concerned that a first-year student from Israel may have served in the IDF. She asked if that meant he had participated in the genocide of Palestinians and asked her colleagues what to do about it.Senator Scott Wiener posted Dr Marya's post and said that Dr Marya was creating a toxic, hostile environment at the USCF by promoting the age-old antisemitic theory that Jewish doctors are harming patients. The post was later deleted. Wiener said this wasn’t the first time Marya has been accused of posting antisemitic content and said the professor has pushed the idea that Jewish doctors harm patients.

Rockland county rigged for Trump? 2024 US election results under scrutiny; NY lawsuit moves forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rockland-county-rigged-for-trump-2024-us-election-results-under-scrutiny-ny-lawsuit-moves-forward/articleshow/121772808.cms,"



A legal challenge questioning the accuracy of the 2024 election results in Rockland County, New York, is moving forward, according to a report by Newsweek.The lawsuit, filed by SMART Legislation, the legal advocacy arm of nonpartisan watchdog SMART Elections, raises concerns about vote counts and statistical anomalies in both the presidential and US Senate races.In May, New York Supreme Court Judge Rachel Tanguay ruled in open court that the allegations were serious enough to proceed to the discovery phase, where evidence will be formally gathered and reviewed.While the lawsuit is unlikely to affect the overall outcome—Congress has already certified President Donald Trump’s victory—it could reignite debate over election integrity.The complaint includes affidavits from voters who claim they voted for independent US Senate candidate Diane Sare, but their votes were not reflected in the certified count by the Rockland County Board of Elections.Additionally, Newsweek reports that the suit cites multiple voting districts where hundreds of voters selected Democratic Senate candidate Kirsten Gillibrand but allegedly cast no votes for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. These patterns raised red flags for analysts.Max Bonamente, a physics and statistics professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said the results in four out of five Rockland County towns were “statistically highly unlikely” compared to the 2020 election.“These data would require extreme sociological or political causes for their explanation, and would benefit from further assurances as to their fidelity,” he wrote.Lulu Friesdat, SMART Legislation's founder, said, “There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely. The best way to determine if the results are correct is to examine the paper ballots in a full public, transparent hand recount.”Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek that such statistical irregularities deserve investigation, though they may stem from non-malicious sources like error or miscalculation.He emphasised that the discrepancies were not significant enough to alter the outcome but said reviewing them could strengthen trust in the electoral process.A hearing in the case is scheduled for September 22.The plaintiffs are demanding a full hand recount of the presidential and Senate ballots cast in Rockland County.","A legal challenge questioning the accuracy of the 2024 election results in rockland county, new york, is moving forward.
