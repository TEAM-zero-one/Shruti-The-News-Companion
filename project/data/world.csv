NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in both the houses of Parliament, describing it as a ""watershed moment"".The contentious legislation cleared both houses of Parliament after extensive debates, with the Rajya Sabha passing it following a marathon 13-hour discussion. The bill received 128 votes in favor and 95 against in the upper house, while the Lok Sabha had earlier approved it with 288 supporting and 232 opposing votes.In a post on X, PM Modi emphasised that the legislation would particularly benefit marginalized sections of society.""The passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Bill and the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill by both Houses of Parliament marks a watershed moment in our collective quest for socio-economic justice, transparency and inclusive growth. This will particularly help those who have long remained on the margins, thus being denied both voice and opportunity,"" he said.The Prime Minister thanked parliamentarians for their participation in discussions and acknowledged public contributions to the Parliamentary committee.""For decades, the Waqf system was synonymous with lack of transparency and accountability. This especially harmed the interests of Muslim women, poor Muslims, Pasmanda Muslims. The legislations passed by Parliament will boost transparency and also safeguard people’s rights,"" PM Modi said.""We will now enter an era where the framework will be more modern and sensitive to social justice. On a larger note, we remain committed to prioritising the dignity of every citizen. This is also how we build a stronger, more inclusive and more compassionate India,"" he added.The bill faced strong opposition from INDIA bloc parties, who labeled it ""anti-Muslim"" and ""unconstitutional."" Opposition leaders, including those from Congress, TMC, DMK, and other parties, alleged that the legislation was designed to facilitate the takeover of Muslim properties for corporate interests.Parliament also approved the complementary Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, during the same session.The government defended the legislation as a ""historic reform"" aimed at benefiting the minority community and promoting inclusive growth.

"India gets slapped with tariff, others punched",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-slapped-with-tariff-others-punched/articleshow/119961287.cms,"India's reaction:

At a White House Rose Garden event on Wednesday on what he called “Liberation Day” for the US, India became a middling victim in Trump’s take-no-prisoner approach that treated friend and foe alike with a two-tier tariff: a baseline tax of 10% on all countries that will go into effect on April 5, and additional tariffs on some countries that he considers to be the “worst offenders”, which will be imposed on April 9.India, described by Trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the US President’s ‘worst offender’ checklist because, by his calculation, New Delhi taxes US imports to the tune of 52%, a dubious figure arrived at by adding perceived non-monetary, nontariff barriers, ‘currency manipulation’ etc. China was assessed at 67%, Taiwan at 64%, and South Korea at 50%.But out of the ‘kindness of his heart’ he would impose not a ‘commonsense reciprocal tariff’ but give a 50% ‘discount,’ Trump said, thus making it 27% tariff on imports from India.“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far – both friend and foe alike. Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president of the richest country on earth raged in remarks that were borderline offensive and distasteful.Financial markets plunged in response. Some $2tn of market value was wiped out in S&P 500 stocks alone as the index fell 4%, its worst day since Sept 2022. The dollar experienced its largest single-day decline on record, dropping 2.1% against major currencies.The ripple effect of Trump’s sweeping tariffs will reshape global trade flows, disrupt supply chains, and test longstanding diplomatic alliances. As countries scramble to respond, the economic and geopolitical fallout is likely to be deep and enduring.The govt said it would seek to “expeditiously” clinch a “mutually beneficial” bilateral trade deal with the US and reiterated its commitment to strong strategic relations.Sources said the commerce department is consulting export councils and ministries to gauge the fallout and explore support for affected businesses.With PM Modi and Trump agreeing to a bilateral trade agreement later this year, India and the US have finalised the broad contours of detailed discussions with technical negotiations expected to be launched this month. This, sources said, gave India a lead over others who will now begin an engagement with the US to seek tariff cuts. “India was an early mover and over the last 50 days a lot of work has been done. The idea is to settle all outstanding bilateral trade issues,” an official said. The assessment is that the Trump administration too is keen to engage and a deal can be crafted by lowering a few duties in India.","India, described by trump as the ‘tariff king’, makes the us president’s ‘worst offender’ checklist.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by thailand pm paetongtarn shinawatra.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court judges led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna have unanimously decided to make public their assets and liabilities as a dormant issue about wealth of constitutional court judges was revived after the alleged discovery of a huge amount of cash at high court judge Justice Yashwant Varma's official residence on March 14, reports .CJI Khanna mooted the proposal before the collegium comprising himself and Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, A S Oka and Vikram Nath and later, the issue was put forth before a full court meeting Tuesday. All judges agreed to the proposal to make public their assets and liabilities by posting it on the SC's website. The SC in a press release said 30 of the 33 SC judges, including the CJI, have declared their assets.Two newly-appointed judges - Justices K Vinod Chandran and Joymalya Bagchi - are yet to declare their assets and liabilities to the CJI. The SC has a sanctioned strength of 34 judges but one post is vacant.""The assets and liabilities statements of judges, which are mandatorily declared before the CJI by every judge of the SC and, thereafter, kept in sealed cover, is likely to be uploaded on the SC website by the end of this month,"" an SC source told TOI.The full court of the SC in Aug 2009, during the tenure of CJI K G Balakrishnan, had decided to upload the assets and liabilities declared by judges immediately after getting appointed to the SC, on the SC website after Justice Shylendra Kumar of Karnataka HC publicly joined issue with CJI Balakrishnan for his stand that judges should not be required to disclose their assets to the public.But the practice petered out four or five years later when a judge stirred a huge controversy by mentioning ""daughters' marriage"" as a liability in her declaration. Moreover, judges, who as lawyers had roaring practices prior to joining constitutional courts, were reluctant to share details of their huge assets.In Nov 2019, a five-judge SC bench, of which Justice Khanna was a part, had ruled that the office of CJI was a public authority and amenable to RTI Act. Justice Khanna had said independence of judiciary and transparency went hand in hand. Justice N V Ramana, who became CJI in 2021, had concurred with Justice Khanna and said there should be a balance between right to information, transparency and independence of judiciary.Declaration of assets and liabilities by judges started with a full court resolution of the SC on May 7, 1997, which read, ""Resolved that every judge should make a declaration of all his/her assets in the form of real estate or investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or in the name of his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her) within a reasonable time of assuming office and in the case of sitting judge within a reasonable time of adoption of this resolution and thereafter whenever any acquisition of substantial nature is made, it shall be disclosed within a reasonable time.""

The US stock market plunged sharply on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 1,400 points, or 3.3%, amid widespread concerns triggered by President Donald Trump ’s latest set of severe tariffs.According to news agency AP, the S&P 500 fell 4%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.1%, reflecting a broader global market sell-off. At one point in the morning, the S&P 500 was on track for its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.The announcement of new tariffs on imports, including a 10% baseline tax on a range of products, caused significant alarm among investors, fuelling fears of rising inflation and slowing economic growth. The impact was felt globally, with major stock indexes in Europe and Asia also suffering sharp losses.The tariffs have rattled markets, with commodities like crude oil, tech stocks, and even gold—all traditionally seen as safe havens—declining in value. The Russell 2000 index of smaller US companies dropped 5.9%, dipping more than 20% below its record.Trump’s new tariffs include heightened taxes on imports from countries like China and those in the European Union . Economists warn that the tariffs could lower US economic growth by as much as 2 percentage points this year and push inflation close to 5%, potentially dragging the economy into a recession ""Markets may actually be underreacting, especially if these rates turn out to be final, given the potential knock-on effects to global consumption and trade,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.The Federal Reserve faces a challenging dilemma. While it may consider cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, such moves could further fuel inflation. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note dropped to 4.04% from 4.20% late Wednesday, reflecting growing concerns about the economy’s future.Despite the ongoing economic growth, data released Thursday showed signs of strain. Unemployment claims remained lower than expected, suggesting a stable labour market, but weaker-than-anticipated growth in US service industries highlighted the broader effects of the tariffs. Businesses reported supply chain disruptions, higher costs for materials like aluminium, and delays in deliveries.Corporate stocks took a major hit, with retailers and airlines among the worst affected. Best Buy dropped 15.2%, United Airlines lost 12.3%, and Target fell 10.3%, as investors grew worried about the impact of the tariffs on consumer spending and business activity.Internationally, European and Asian markets followed suit. France's CAC 40 dropped 3.3%, Germany's DAX lost 3%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.5%.

Stock market recommendations:Nifty during last week on expected lines consolidated in the range of 23,000-23,800 after a 8.5% rally in the preceding 15 sessions. Index in the process worked off the overbought condition developed after the recent sharp rally.Key observation in the daily chart of Nifty is that it has already taken 7 sessions to retrace just 50% of its preceding 6 sessions up move (22,353-23,869). A shallow retracement signals overall positive price structure and a higher base formation above the 50 days EMA. Nifty during the current consolidation phase has absorbed the entire volatility related to US tariff highlighting strength. Hence, we believe the current breather should be used as a buying opportunity in quality stocks in a staggered manner.Going ahead, in the coming week we expect the index to resume up move after the recent breather and gradually head higher towards 23,869 (last week high) and then towards 24,200 levels in the coming weeks being the high of January 2025 and 50% retracement of the entire 5 months decline (26,277-21965)On the downside, 23,000-22,700 would act as strong support being the confluence of the recent breakout area and 50% and 61.8% retracement area of the recent up move from 21965-23869.The recent sharp decline of US 10-year yields below 4.2%, Dollar index below 104 and Brent crude staying below $ 75 is positive sign for India’s economy and Equity market.","According to bajaj broking research, nhpc and symphony are the top stock picks for today.

The claim originated on X, where a user alleged that Edwards made the staggering offer to Ayesha Howard to settle child support obligations upfront. The rumor quickly spread, with another post asserting that the 23-year-old NBA star had already paid $1,080,000 in a single lump sum.Ayesha Howard swiftly shut down the speculation circulating online. Speaking to The Shade Room, she made it clear that no such arrangement had been made. “There are no court documents, motions, or proceedings that have occurred, nor have I been offered or agreed to such terms,” she stated, directly refuting the viral claim.Howard also took to Instagram to express her frustration over the spread of misinformation, posting a message that read: “You ever heard a rumor about yourself and actually wanted to hear more?

Tim Tebow’s White House visit was a reunion of Florida icons with a shared Gator connection

Has Tim Tebow ever supported Donald Trump? Here’s the truth behind their connection

NFL legend and former Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow made headlines with a surprise visit to the White House, accompanied by his wife, Demi-Leigh Tebow, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio . The trio met with former President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, where they posed for photos while proudly doing the famous "" Gator Chomp ""—a signature gesture from Tebow’s alma mater, the University of Florida.As soon as images from the meeting surfaced, social media buzzed with speculation about the nature of their visit. While some fans saw it as a simple, friendly gathering, others questioned whether it hinted at a deeper political connection between Tebow and Trump. Given Tebow’s longstanding efforts to remain apolitical, the visit has naturally sparked curiosity and debate.Tim Tebow and Donald Trump have crossed paths before, but this latest visit to the White House was anything but ordinary. Tebow, a celebrated Florida Gators legend, and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida native, were invited to meet Trump in the Oval Office. The trio bonded over their Florida roots, with photos capturing them smiling and performing the ""Gator Chomp,"" a beloved symbol among University of Florida alumni and fans.The meeting was centered around advocacy for child trafficking prevention , not political alignment. This isn’t the first time Tebow has been linked to Trump, but he has historically stayed clear of political endorsements. However, his presence at the White House has left many wondering whether the former quarterback is stepping into new territory.Tim Tebow has been very vocal about the fight against human trafficking and is working hard to make a difference. Through his foundation, he has launched several programs to help rescue and support victims. He also teamed up with Congress to push for stronger laws and better protection for those affected. His goal is to spread awareness and take real action to end human trafficking for good.Back in 2016, Tebow was invited to speak at the Republican National Convention, but he later backed out, explaining that he wanted to focus on his foundation and charitable work instead. While he has met Trump on multiple occasions, including a well-documented golf outing years ago, he has never officially supported the former president—or any politician for that matter.Tebow has built his reputation on faith, sports, and philanthropy rather than politics, which makes this visit particularly intriguing.Also read - New photos of Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld show why he’s the most supportive fiancé","Tim tebow made a surprise visit to the white house with his wife, demi-leigh tebow, and florida senator marco rubio.
