In 1861, the British Raj had an epiphany. To better assert their control over the Indian population, they felt they needed to know more about the region’s history and culture. This, combined with the passion of a young army engineer named Alexander Cunningham for mapping and restoring India’s historical remains, led to the establishment of the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Cunningham went on to become its first head.The ASI, which holds guardianship of over 3,600 monuments across the nation today, was initially tasked with preserving historical landmarks as well as studying the history of the Indian subcontinent through archaeological discoveries and excavations. In later years, its role expanded to include boosting India’s image as a prime tourist destination with vast historical assets.Of late though, ASI has waded into fraught terrain by investigating contentious claims that ancient mosques were built over pre-existing Hindu temples. The most recent is Sambhal where ASI is conducting surveys in the Shahi Mosque vs Harihar Mandir case. Last month, it submitted a report saying it had found evidence of a temple at the Gyanvapi mosque complex in Varanasi. While the survey on the Shahi Idgah mosque in Mathura has been put on hold by the Supreme Court, the ASI has been directed to conduct surveys and excavations following a petition claiming a temple exists below the famed Ajmer Sharif.As ASI lines up archaeologists, surveyors and field experts to dig deep into each case, it also raises questions as to whether the custodian of monuments has lost its original focus on protecting cultural heritage, and become more aligned with resolving centuries-old religious disputes on the pretext of archaeological research.Most ASI officials declined to comment, saying it was a politically and legal ly sensitive issue. “ASI’s role is to discover the truth. We are not driven by any local or political pressure. Our job is to explore archaeological evidence in the disputed sites and present our findings to the courts. Excavations have always been a mandate of ASI and well within our designated purview,’’ says an ASI official.However, some archaeology officials who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed the importance of ASI maintaining its secular image and felt it should not become involved in religious disputes. Former ASI director K N Dixit , who was recently honoured with the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to archaeology, was of the viewpoint that history should never be influenced by politics, a perspective shared by many officials of the organisation, former and current.Dr B R Mani , senior archaeologist, former ADG, ASI, and currently DG, National Museum, observed that avoiding an ideological and communal battle between Hindu and Muslim stakeholders is a tricky task. “Ultimately, you can’t please both contesting parties, and this is where ASI’s role becomes crucial. ASI is a government body and any verdict delivered by them on a disputed site becomes the official mandate. So, one has to be careful to ensure the powers of ASI are not misused on the behest of any faction,’’ he says.Mani pointed out that the Ayodhya case set a precedent. “The Ayodhya case should ideally have been treated as an exception, but now all courts are asking ASI to do similar archaeological excavations in other disputed religious sites. Resolving religious disputes was never the mandate of ASI, but when the courts give directions to carry out surveys at these sites, ASI has to follow,’’ he says.Alok Tripathi Silchar, who led a team of surveyors to examine whether Gyanvapi mosque was built on the remains of a demolished temple, was also clear. “The survey has been done in compliance with court orders. There can be no other interpretation and we do not comment on legal issues,’’ he says.Within ASI, there are differing views on the controversial excavations in the current political climate. The more popular view is that archaeological excavations at any site (religious or not) will yield new findings which can be an asset to the nation. The contrary view is that almost every Indian structure has layers of history associated with it and excavations should take that into account. “At one time, the country was a majority Hindu civilisation. Then Islamic rulers started to invade the Indian sub-continent and brought their own beliefs, philosophy, and teachings.There was widespread destruction of temples across the country and they built their own structures over them. This has been widely documented in many instances. But at the end of the day, all such relics, irrespective of when they were constructed, are a part of Indian history. So, which chapter of history do we want to preserve,” asks an official.A number of archaeologists and historians also wonder why ASI is no longer prioritising excavations at historically rich places like Rakhigarhi or other sites of Harappan and Indus Valley civilisations. Conservation work is also suffering, they say, with the ministry of culture itself admitting last year that over 50 monuments had gone missing. “The focus now seems to be primarily on excavating sites of Islamic structures to prove the existence of temples. Where does it end? There is documented proof that World Heritage Site Qutub Minar was built on the ruins of 27 temples. Are we ready to revisit history here as well,’’ asks an expert. In fact, cultural appropriation began in the Indian sub-continent long before the arrival of Islam or Hinduism. “India had a rich Buddhist history before the arrival of Hindu kings. Some believe that notable sites like Jagannath temple in Puri were built over Buddhist and Jain sites. There may or may not be archaeological evidence, but can we go on excavating every historic structure to find what predates it? At some point, we need to accept history as it stands today,’’ says a historian, requesting anonymity.Historian Swapna Liddle said the problem was not surveys but the motives behind them. “The purpose of archaeological excavation or any kind of scientific investigation is to further our knowledge and understand the site and the history. It is always done with an open mind. But it becomes problematic when these investigations are done with a preconceived notion. If we are not open about our motivations, then what are we even doing,” asks Liddle. She gave the example of Delhi’s Purana Qila monument, which is widely believed to be the original site of ancient Indraprastha. “There is an incessant need to prove it is there, despite no concrete evidence unearthed after decades of excavations. How long will we keep digging?’’ says Liddle.Reacting to the archaeological surveys at disputed mosque sites, conservationist AGK Menon questioned what purpose they served. “As per my understanding, these recent court-ordered surveys are in contravention of the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, which clearly stated that you cannot disturb any existing place of worship anymore. But what’s been happening of late is setting a dangerous precedent,” he says. The recent SC order may have put a temporary pause on new pleas for excavations but there is no telling what the future might dig up.","As temple-mosque disputes rise, archaeology becomes a minefield. The most recent is sambhal where asi is conducting surveys in the shahi mosque vs harihar mandir case. Most asi officials declined to comment, saying it was a politically and legal ly sensitive issue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118516449,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1203792,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After India called upon authorities in Dhaka to not spread negativity in the relationship, external affairs minister S Jaishankar again raised the issue of its hostile behaviour, saying Bangladesh has to make up its mind about what kind of a relationship it wants with India.Speaking barely a week after a meeting with his counterpart Touhid Hossain in Muscat, the minister said Dhaka can't say it wants good relations with India and at the same time blame India for everything that goes wrong domestically.""If every day someone in the interim govt stands up and blames India for everything, some of those things if you look at the reports, are absolutely ridiculous.

Kash Patel, the FBI nominee for former President Donald Trump, appeared before the Senate for his confirmation hearing last week. He was accompanied by a close-knit group of friends and family seated in the front row. Kash Patel 's girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , who was primarily raised in Arkansas, spent her early years in England and Switzerland. The attendees included Alina Habba, Ric Grenell, Special Presidential Envoy for Special Missions, as well as Patel's sister and parents, who travelled from India to witness the hearing.In a show of support, Patel sat behind country music star Alexis Wilkins, who has been revealed as his girlfriend, according to the Daily Mail.A source told the outlet that Patel and Wilkins met at a conservative ReAwaken America event in October 2022.

NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections. They don't need money,"" US president said.""They take advantage of us pretty good. One of the highest tariffed nations in the world. We try and sell something. They have a 200 per cent tariff. And then we're giving them a lot of money to help them with their election,"" he added.The criticism follows Trump's ongoing scrutiny of alleged USAID funding across various nations.

Italian Prime Minister GIORGIA MELONI'S Full Speech at CPAC 2025

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has claimed that the Left is panicking over US President Donald Trump ’s victory, accusing liberals of hypocrisy and global conservatives of being unfairly called a “threat to democracy.”Speaking via videolink at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington DC on Saturday, Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.The Italian PM argued that the Left’s frustration had turned into “hysteria” following Trump’s return to power, not only because conservatives were winning elections but because they were now working together internationally. “When Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created the global leftist liberal network in the 90s, they were called statesmen,” she said.“Today, when Trump, Meloni, Milei or maybe Modi talk, they are called a threat to democracy. This is the last double standard, but we are used to it, and the good news is people no longer believe in their lies, despite all the mud they throw at us. Citizens keep voting for us,"" she added.Meloni backed Trump as a strong leader, dismissing any suggestion that his presidency would create rifts within the conservative movement . “Our adversaries hope that President Trump will move away from us, but knowing him as a strong and effective leader I bet that those who hope for divisions will be proven wrong,” she said.Meloni also defended JD Vance, who faced criticism for his speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he said Europe’s greatest threat came “from within.” Meloni dismissed the backlash, claiming liberal elites were uncomfortable with conservatives speaking openly about identity and democracy. “Vice President Vance was discussing something deeper: identity, democracy, freedom of speech,” she said.Meloni’s participation in CPAC came amid calls from Italian opposition leaders to cancel her appearance. The controversy followed former Trump advisor Steve Bannon’s speech at the event, during which he appeared to make a Nazi-style salute. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein condemned CPAC as a “neo-fascist gathering” and urged Meloni to disassociate from it. However, Meloni went ahead with her speech, aligning herself with the conservative movement and dismissing left-wing criticism.She reiterated her belief in a conservative vision of leadership and said that, “We serve the people, we do not rule over them.”","Italian prime minister giorgia meloni spoke at the conservative political action conference in washington dc on saturday.

On Wednesday evening, a large group of activists gathered outside SpaceX 's Washington, D.C., office to protest recent federal job cuts announced by the Trump administration. The demonstration, which blocked traffic in front of the aerospace company's headquarters, was a result of mounting frustration over government layoffs. The protest followed a march that began at Federal Triangle and concluded at 11th and F Street Northwest.The demonstrators, including former federal employees and labor union members, held signs criticizing Elon Musk’s influence in the current administration. One protester’s sign read, ""No one voted for Elon Musk ,"" referencing his role in establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been central to recent budget cuts. These layoffs have disproportionately affected employees in various government agencies, including the National Park Service.Union organizers have called for continued protests, highlighting the adverse impact of these job cuts on essential public services such as housing, environmental conservation, and historical preservation. As tensions escalate, the movement against these workforce reductions continues to gain traction.The primary catalyst for Wednesday’s demonstration was the Trump administration’s implementation of extensive federal job cuts. These layoffs, reportedly part of a broader effort to reduce government spending, have led to uncertainty and distress among public sector employees.Tiffany Montes, a former National Park Service worker, shared her frustration and disappointment after being unexpectedly dismissed from her role in historic preservation. Despite two years of dedicated service as an intern and securing a permanent position, she received a termination email on Friday.Montes told NBC News. She further expressed disbelief at the justification for her termination.Montes was among hundreds of National Park Service employees dismissed under the new measures. The National Park Service plays a crucial role in maintaining historical landmarks, including the White House, and the job cuts have raised concerns about the potential neglect of these important sites.Paul Osadebe, a representative of the Federal Unionists Network, emphasized the risks posed by these job losses.he stated.Union leaders have warned that these cuts could have severe consequences for government services, affecting infrastructure, housing, and public safety.Elon Musk has gained significant influence within the Trump administration since Donald Trump assumed the presidency last month. One of his most controversial moves was the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency tasked with reducing federal spending.DOGE's primary goal is to streamline government operations and eliminate what it deems unnecessary expenditures. However, critics argue that its aggressive cost-cutting measures have led to the indiscriminate removal of employees essential to public services.Protesters outside SpaceX's office held Musk accountable for his role in implementing these workforce reductions. Many view his growing political influence as a concern, particularly since the agency’s budget reduction strategy has resulted in widespread job insecurity.The Trump administration has justified the job cuts as necessary for achieving fiscal responsibility. DOGE has outlined a plan to reduce federal spending by $2 trillion within the next year.To facilitate this process, DOGE previously sent mass emails to over two million federal employees, offering a voluntary resignation program. Those who accepted the offer were promised continued salary and benefits through September of this year. However, the administration had warned that if an insufficient number of employees opted for voluntary resignation, involuntary layoffs would follow.As a result, mass terminations were implemented across multiple agencies, affecting thousands of workers. The administration argues that these cuts will lead to a leaner, more efficient government, though critics contend that the measures disproportionately impact lower-level employees while leaving higher-ranking officials unaffected.In response to the job cuts, activist groups and labor unions have vowed to continue their demonstrations. The Federal Unionists Network, the organization behind Wednesday’s protest, has planned a mutual aid event on Friday evening to provide support for affected workers.Union leaders anticipate further demonstrations in the coming weeks, particularly as more workers begin to feel the effects of the layoffs. Protesters have also urged lawmakers to intervene and reconsider the restructuring efforts led by DOGE.","Elon musk faces heat as federal layoffs spark protests at spacex hq.

Has any gold been removed?



US President Donald Trump on Saturday said that Elon Musk will be looking at gold depository at Fort Knox ""to make sure the gold is still there"".The United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox has served as the storage facility for the country's precious metal bullion reserves since 1937, earning a reputation for its robust security.""We're going to open up the doors. We're going to inspect Fort Knox,"" Trump said in a speech to Republican governors Thursday evening.""I don't want to open it and the cupboards are bare,"" he added.In addition to safeguarding the gold, Fort Knox also functions as the Army's human resources command center and hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.The Army post, located about 35 miles south of Louisville, covers 109,000 acres across three Kentucky counties—Bullitt, Hardin, and Mead.Established during World War I, Camp Knox was initially an artillery training center. It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known as Fort Knox ever since. In 1937, the first shipment of gold arrived at Fort Knox, with the 1st Cavalry Regiment assigned to guard it.When World War II broke out in Europe, the Army formed the Armored Force at Fort Knox, where thousands of soldiers were introduced to tank training. For nearly 80 years, the post was called the ""Home of Cavalry and Armor.""In 2005, the Army moved the Armor Center and School to Fort Benning, Georgia, and established the Human Resource Command Center of Excellence at Fort Knox. In 2013, ROTC Cadet Summer Training was consolidated at the base, and it now hosts the Army's largest annual training event each summer.According to the US Mint, Fort Knox currently holds 147.3 million ounces of gold, which accounts for about half of the US Treasury's total gold reserves.""There's like 5,000 tons of gold in Fort Knox. We all want to see it. This is your gold. It's the public's gold. I don't know if it's there. We just want to see it and make sure someone didn't spray paint some lead or something. Part of this is also let's have some fun and it's the public's gold so we have a right to see it,"" Elon Musk said.""The President seems into it. It should be a live tour, let's open the door and see what's behind it. I'd watch that. What does 5000 tons of gold even look like? Maybe there's some other stuff in there too,"" he added.Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold’s book value is $42.22 per ounce.It is said that no single person knows all the procedures to open the vault.","Us president donald trump said that elon musk will be looking at gold depository at fort knox ""to make sure the gold is still there"" fort knox has served as the storage facility for the country's precious metal bullion reserves since 1937.

Becoming the second largest party in terms ofnumbers in Germany, far-right Alternative for Germany party (German: Alternative für Deutschland) has achieved a significant milestone, securing the position merely 12 years after its establishment.AfD garnered approximately 20% of votes, reflecting a twofold increase from its 2021 electoral performance, and emerged as the dominant political entity in eastern Germany.During the victory celebration, AfD's lead candidate Alice Weidel expressed openness to forming a coalition with the victorious centre-right alliance comprising the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), whilst criticising CDU leader Friedrich Merz.Addressing supporters, Weidel said, ""They wanted to halve us, but the opposite has happened!""The AfD dominated political discussions through its anti-immigration stance , advocating for restricting refugee and asylum seeker entry.Tesla CEO Elon Musk and US vice president JD Vance publicly endorsed AfD during the campaign. German security authorities partially classify the party as far-right extremist, with certain chapters under surveillance.AfD officials have questioned equal rights for Germans with immigrant backgrounds and some even faced scrutiny for using prohibited Nazi-era symbols. Notably, Thuringian AfD chair Björn Höcke received two convictions in 2024 for using banned Hitler-era paramilitary slogans.Mass demonstrations against the AfD occurred nationwide before the election, with protesters viewing the party's ascent as threatening democracy and immigrants.Despite electoral gains, the AfD's performance fell short of internal aspirations for first place. In a televised debate, Merz firmly rejected coalition possibilities, citing fundamental policy disagreements, particularly regarding EU membership, currency, and Ukraine support.Looking ahead, Weidel has positioned herself for the 2029 chancellor candidacy, declaring on AfD TV: ""We will overtake the CDU/CSU. And then we will get a mandate to govern.""","Far-right alternative for germany (afd) has achieved a significant milestone, securing the position merely 12 years after its establishment.
