‘US Controlled Pak Nuclear Arsenal’: Ex-CIA Agent’s Bombshell, Says ‘Pak Can’t Win Against India’

'Millions of dollars' to Pak intel

'Qaida Plant' & Osama Escape

The US intelligence community believed that India and Pakistan were on the brink of war in 2002, following the Parliament attack (Dec 2001) and the tense military standoff that followed under Operation Parakram, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said. Such was the threat perception that families were evaucated from Islamabad, he added. The State Department at the time was urging restraint on both sides, essentially advising that if a fight were unavoidable it should be kept short and strictly conventional, because the introduction of nuclear weapons would transform the situation for everyone.Even as the CIA in 2002 chanced upon evidence connecting al-Qaida and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the US decided that its relationship with Pakistan ""is bigger than India, Pakistan...we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at this point"".""...In March of 2002, we raided a Lashkar-e-Taiba safe house in Lahore. And in that house, we captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters who had with them a copy of the al-Qaida training manual. And it was the first time, analytically, that we were able to connect Lashkar-e-Taiba with al-Qaida. I remember receiving a cable from the deputy director of the CIA for intelligence congratulating us on finding this training manual, saying it was the very first time that we could attach the Pakistani govt to al-Qaida,"" he said.Asked about the issue not being highlighted, he said the decision was made at the White House. ""And the decision was that that the relationship is bigger than India, Pakistan. At least temporarily. The relationship, we needed the Pakistanis actually more than they needed us at that point. We were happy to throw money at them. That's what they responded to. But we really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,"" he said.Kiriakou pointed to India's stated posture on nuclear coercion, saying New Delhi has warned it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail and will respond decisively to any terror attack. He highlighted a string of Indian responses to terrorism over recent years, including surgical strikes across Line of Control in 2016, Balakot airstrikes in 2019, and Operation Sindoor in May of this year.American defence contractor funds and cash rewards handed out in Pakistan over decades of counterterrorism cooperation with US enriched some ISI officers, former CIA officer he said. ""I feel that Pakistani groups with an eye towards India benefited because of those American defence contractor monies. Their defence parts were all turned towards India. We paid tens of millions of dollars in cash as rewards to the Pakistani intelligence service. And God knows what they did with that money,"" he said.The former CIA officer also referred Osama bin Laden escaping after CIA had tracked him down soon after 9/11. ""We believed in Oct of 2001 that we had Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership cornered at Tora Bora. We did not know that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an al-Qaida operative who had infiltrated the US military. We told him to come down the mountain. And he said through the translator, can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we'll give up. .. What ended up happening was bin Laden, dressed as a woman, escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,"" he said.",Former cia officer john kiriakou: 'millions of dollars' to pak intel enriched some isi officers.

India to hold major tri-service exercise on western frontier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-hold-major-tri-service-exercise-on-western-frontier/articleshow/124820830.cms,"Operation Trishul

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Stresses Tri-Services Integration After Operation Sindoor’s Success

NEW DELHI: India is now conducting a major tri-Service combat exercise called “Trishul” on the western front with Pakistan, with a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued for all aircraft to avoid a vast swathe of airspace along the border in Rajasthan and Gujarat from Oct 30 to Nov 10.Pakistan, too, has issued a notification restricting multiple air traffic routes along its central and southern airspace, though somewhat away from the border, possibly for an exercise or weapons test on Oct 28-29.This muscle-flexing is reminiscent of the multiple NOTAMs issued by both countries in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor during which India conducted deep precision strikes against nine terror hubs as well as 11 airbases and radar sites from May 7 to 10.A senior military officer told TOI that the ongoing wargames are “routine”, in accordance with the practice to conduct a major tri-Service exercise at least once a year. The sheer scale, complexity and area of operations, however, is quite huge. “Multiple joint combat drills, both offensive and defensive in nature, will be executed during Trishul,” an officer said.Moreover, the exercise comes soon after defence minister Rajnath Singh warned Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, the 96-km-long tidal estuary between the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat and the Sindh province of Pakistan, which is a major bilateral dispute.“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek Sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” he had said.Under the overall Trishul exercise, the armed forces will conduct joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational drills.The Army has deployed well over 20,000 soldiers with main-battle tanks, howitzers, armed helicopters and different kinds of missile systems. Drills like `Trinetra’ with a focus on “full-cycle electromagnetic spectrum operations and counter-unmanned aerial system kill-chains” are already being conducted by the 21 `Sudarshan Chakra’ strike corps in the desert sector.The IAF, in turn, will soon swing into action with `Mahagujraj” high-tempo operations, with frontline fighters like Rafales and Sukhoi-30MKIs, special aircraft, helicopters, remotely-piloted aircraft and force-enablers like IL-78 mid-air refuellers and airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft being deployed from several air bases.The Navy, too, has deployed some frigates and destroyers off the Gujarat coast for the intensive combat manoeuvres. “Remember, the Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat will be a target for Pakistan in any full-scale war,” said the officer.“Different indigenous weapon systems and innovations will be fully tested during the Trishul exercise. In the non-kinetic domains, ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), EW (electronic warfare and cyber capabilities will also be a focus area,” the officer said.",India is conducting a major tri-service combat exercise called ‘trishul’ on the western front with pakistan.

"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","Cji b r gavai and justice surya kant, the next cji, stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges. They said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124772954,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24012,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"PM Modi to attend Asean summit virtually, Congress takes a swipe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-attend-asean-summit-virtually-congress-takes-a-swipe/articleshow/124772222.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by modi might be preoccupation with bihar assembly elections.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (aon) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (lpds) another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles for the s-400 triumf air defence systems for over rs 10,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-717429,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan ranks 104th on the global passport index, making its passport the weakest in the world. Afghan citizens can travel visa-free to only 25 countries.This limited mobility is largely due to prolonged conflict, political instability, and restricted diplomatic reach. For most international destinations, Afghan travelers must undergo lengthy visa application processes, and approvals are often uncertain.Syria is on number two on the list. Its low ranking is shaped by years of civil war and political instability. Only a few countries grant visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to Syrians. The passport holders also have to face severe entry requirements. Security is the main concern here.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan has also a low ranking because of its ever-changing political scenario, security, and cross border tensions. Pakistani passport holders often have to go through lengthy visa procedures, their rejection rate is also high.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity.","Afghanistan ranks 104th on the global passport index, making its passport the weakest in the world.

Gisele Bündchen’s shocking confession on The Tonight Show

Reflecting on the struggles behind the supermodel image





Supermodel Gisele Bündchen has spent decades dazzling the fashion world, but behind the glamour lies a lesser-known story of survival. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in March 2024, the 43-year-old model opened up about a harrowing moment from her early career that nearly cost her life, an icy photoshoot gone wrong in Iceland more than two decades ago.While playing the segment “True Confessions,” Bündchen stunned both Jimmy Fallon and fellow guest Wayne Brady with a revelation that sounded almost too wild to be true. “I did a photo shoot on a fake iceberg in Iceland and I almost fell off into the ocean,” she admitted, referring to a late-’90s campaign for Lanvin’s Oxygene fragrance.The model went on to explain that the set was surrounded by real icebergs and freezing waters. “I would’ve been dead in seconds because you know what happens inside of the freezing water of the icebergs? [In] seconds you’re dead — dead!” she said. Despite the life-threatening conditions, Bündchen had to maintain her composure, posing elegantly in a slip dress while the crew, safely aboard a boat, wore heavy jackets and life vests. Fallon, initially skeptical, asked, “Wait, you almost died?” to which the supermodel confirmed, yes, the story was entirely true.That terrifying shoot was just one chapter in Bündchen’s extraordinary yet demanding career. Around the same time, she was dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks brought on by the relentless pressures of the modeling industry. During a 2024 appearance on The View, she opened up about the “long journey” to recovery, crediting a naturopath’s advice for changing her life.“I wanted to feel better, I didn’t know what to do, so I found this amazing naturopath and he said to me, ‘Gisele, we have to change your diet,’” she shared. Through meditation, yoga, and breath work, she eventually found balance, transforming not only her body but her mindset.Today, as she promotes her wellness cookbook Nourish, Gisele Bündchen stands as proof that even the most glamorous icons have faced icy waters, both literally and metaphorically and found the strength to rise above them.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen leaves fans speechless after revealing her secret to conquering anxiety naturally",Supermodel gisele bundchen shared a harrowing experience from her early career.

Pop sensation Madison Beer is entering a deeply emotional and introspective phase of her music career with her upcoming album, Locket, set for release on January 16, 2026. The 25-year-old singer has described this record as her “most personal project to date,” one that captures nostalgia, heartbreak, and personal growth through songs that feel like pieces of her life preserved in time. The album title itself, a locket, symbolizes cherished memories and emotional moments that fans believe might reveal subtle hints about her love life.In a recent interview on The Travis Mills Show, Beer revealed that the inspiration behind Locket came from real-life experiences and emotional connections to the past. She explained, “I knew I wanted it to be something very personal and tangible. It’s like every song is a memory, something you’d want to keep close.”While she hasn’t named names, listeners suspect the album could touch on her rumored romance with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and her past relationship with influencer Nick Austin.

Although neither has publicly confirmed their relationship, sources close to them describe their bond as genuine and supportive despite demanding careers.From her early discovery by Justin Bieber to her acclaimed debut album Life Support, Madison Beer has evolved from a viral teen talent into a confident artist who channels her real emotions into timeless music.

'Won't Rely On America': Canada's Big Message To Trump As Tariffs Strain Bilateral Ties

Why Donald Trump is angry with Canada over a Ronald Reagan ad





But is the ad fake?









Ontario premier Doug Ford whose ad campaign is believed to be the reason that rankled US President Donald Trump to the point that he announced the end of trade talks with Canada, reacted to Trump's announcement and shared a full YouTube link to Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address. In the address, Reagan speaks against tariffs and discuss the importance of free but fair trade.“Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together. God bless Canada and God bless the United States,” the premier wrote.After a few hours, Ford confirmed that he will pause the ad. ""Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses. We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels. I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games,"" he said.Doug's government launched the $75 million ad campaign earlier this month using clips of Reagan saying how he dislike tariffs. Trump said the ad was fake and Canada got caught cheating.Trump said Regan loved tariffs for the US and its national security. “TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED,” Trump wrote in a major setback for the Carney government who's trying very hard to come across as a stronger force than Justin Trudeau who was reduced to the status of a 'governor' by Trump.The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also reacted to the ads, accusing the Ontario government of “using selective audio and video” clips and misrepresenting Reagan’s remarks.“The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is reviewing its legal options in this matter,” a written statement from the foundation read.Experts have gone through the ad and the actual address of Reagan and found out that the as was not fake but edited.Ford had said earlier that they placed the ad on every major US network so that people get to know what Reagan used to think. “That ad, it’s not a nasty ad,” Ford said. “It’s very factual. And coming from a person like Ronald Reagan, every Republican is going to identify that voice.”'Liberal elbows gone'Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre mocked Carney for his earlier promise to negotiate a win with Trump. ""Mark Carney promised to “negotiate a win” with President Trump and to get a deal by July 21st. Still no deal. Still no win. Liberal elbows gone. US tariffs up. Jobs headed south,"" Poilievre posted.","Mark carney comes under attack as trump ends trade talk with canada, doug ford claims he didn't make a fake ad featuring reagan.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie javice, founder of fintech company frank, found guilty of defrauding jpmorgan chase of $175 million.

US Fed rate cuts: America might still see another rate cut in 2025; govt shutdown clouds economic outlook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-fed-rate-cuts-america-might-still-see-another-rate-cut-in-2025-govt-shutdown-clouds-economic-outlook/articleshow/124821490.cms,"



The US may see another rate cut this year, even as uncertainty looms over the economy due to the ongoing US government shutdown.The Federal Reserve's second-to-last rate meeting of 2025 takes place amid a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies, which has halted the publication of nearly all official economic data. Without these insights, officials must decide on interest rates without the comprehensive information they usually rely upon.Analysts expect the Fed to proceed with a quarter percentage-point cut, lowering its key lending rate to between 3.75 and 4.00%, while remaining cautious about signalling any final rate move in December.The shutdown has intensified debate within the Fed. Policymakers are weighing whether to cut rates quickly to support a weakening labour market or hold steady in the face of inflation that remains stubbornly above the bank’s long-term target of 2%, partly driven by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on major trading partners.""They'll have to decide how much (inflation) is still to come versus how much is just never going to come, and that's the big question right now,"" former Fed official Joseph Gagnon told AFP. He added that “the strength and inflation is only temporary... but the weakness of unemployment might be more long lasting.”""In my view, that argument is going to continue to hold sway this month, because the data are still in that direction,"" Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), said.Since the shutdown began on October 1, the only major data released was US consumer inflation, which showed a 3% rise over the year to September, slightly below expectations. The news buoyed financial markets, with stocks closing at fresh records.The Fed, however, relies on a different inflation measure, which remains well above its target according to pre-shutdown data.Employment has also slowed in recent months, with only 22,000 jobs added in August, although the unemployment rate remained low at 4.3%.""The goal is to get it just right, and that's a hard thing to do with such a blunt tool,"" KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told AFP, referring to the Fed’s key interest rate. Swonk expects two more rate cuts this year and predicts the central bank will also announce an end to its quantitative tightening programme next week amid rising liquidity risks.Political pressures have added to the Fed’s challenges. President Trump has repeatedly attacked chair Jerome Powell on his Truth Social platform and has also sought to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage fraud.Cook has contested the removal, taking the case to the US Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear arguments in January. A ruling is unlikely before February, the deadline for the Fed board to decide on reappointing regional Fed presidents, a process conducted only once every five years.""It seems like the odds that he could do this maneuver are greatly diminished,"" Gagnon said, referring to the administration’s efforts to influence the Fed’s appointments.","The federal reserve's second-to-last rate meeting of 2025 takes place amid a standoff between republicans and democrats over healthcare subsidies.
