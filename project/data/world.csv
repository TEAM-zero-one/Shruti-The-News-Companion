I wished him a very Happy Birthday! He is doing a tremendous job. Narendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine!""

The Asean bloc, after a rather lackluster round of AITIGA (Asean India Trade in Goods Agreement) review in Delhi last month, has offered a new package that will create a ""landing zone"" for India to address the widening trade imbalance concerns. India's trade deficit with Asean stood at approximately $43.57 billion in FY 2022-23.Talking to TOI, Mastura Ahmad Mustafa, deputy secretary general (trade), ministry of investment, trade and industry, Malaysia, said, ""We convened special AEM (Asean Economic Ministers) meetings subsequent to our discussions at the Delhi AITIGA review, to reach key decisions that will help us achieve a substantial conclusion of the review process before this year ends.

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC dismissed Wednesday a petition from Elon Musk's X Corp against content takedowns, ruling that American free speech standards can't be transplanted into Indian constitutional thought and no global platform can evade the nation's laws. It said social media is ""a modern amphitheatre of ideas"" that cannot be left to ""anarchic freedom"".""Regulation is a must, more so in cases of offences against women, failing which the right to dignity as ordained in the Constitution gets railroaded,"" Justice M Nagaprasanna said.

A petitioner who seeks sanctuary under its canopy must be a citizen of the nation, failing which its protective embrace can't be invoked,"" the judge said, stressing that foreign corporations can't take refuge under fundamental rights.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has reportedly halted the issuance of tourist and work visas temporarily for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a comprehensive travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working without issue in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also closely aligns with broader efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification measures, and fully digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working diligently to overhaul its immigration systems to significantly reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

India–Canada Relations Set For Reset; Modi And Carney Seek To Mend Broken Ties | G7 Summit

NEW DELHI: After PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with counterpart Mark Carney in June this year, India and Canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month to New Delhi by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand.This will be the first bilateral visit by the foreign minister of either country since ties nosedived in 2023, following claims by Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau that the Indian government had a role in the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. Both sides remain in touch to finalise the dates for the visit in October.The breakthrough in Modi-Carney meeting on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada led to the return of the high commissioners to each other’s capital earlier this month. High-level bilateral exchanges also seem to have resumed with Canadian National Security and Intelligence Adviser (NSIA) Nathalie Drouin and deputy foreign minister David Morrison visiting India in September.India and Canada have appointed veteran diplomats, Dinesh Patnaik and Christopher Cooter respectively, as high commissioners. According to Anand, Canada backs step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India.India is seeking a constructive and balanced relationship based on respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities.India’s foreign ministry and Global Affairs Canada in talks last week reaffirmed the importance of India–Canada ties, anchored in “shared democratic values, respect for the rule of law, and commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity”. They also agreed to resume bilateral dialogue across key sectors like trade, defence, energy, civil nuclear, security, law enforcement and critical minerals. Amid global uncertainties that have been exacerbated by the US tariff policy, both sides seem keen to expand their economic partnership and build upon people-to-people contacts.Significantly, India and Canada have also agreed to address the shortage of diplomatic staff at their respective missions that resulted from expulsion of diplomats by both sides amid rising tensions last year over Nijjar’s murder. This is important for restoring diplomatic services in both countries for ordinary citizens, students and businesses. In Drouin’s meeting with counterpart Ajit Doval, according to an Indian readout, both sides had acknowledged the “clear momentum” for rebuilding trust and expanding cooperation at the highest levels of political leadership.",India and canada seem set take another decisive step forward to normalise the relationship in the form of a likely visit next month by canadian foreign minister anita anand.

Positive for global stability Negative for US relations

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has suggested that the Donald Trump administration may be willing to “fix” the additional 25 per cent tariffs imposed on India over its purchases of Russian oil.In an interview with NBC News, Rubio said the US expects European nations to step up their own sanctions against Moscow. “I think it’s important for Europe to impose sanctions, too. Right now, there are countries in Europe that are still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas from Russia, which is absurd. They’re asking for the US to impose more sanctions, but there are countries in Europe that are not doing enough,” he said.Rubio added that while the US had taken measures against India, “that’s something we hope we can fix.” He further noted that President Trump retains the option of introducing more sanctions on Russia. “At some point, he may have to decide to impose new sanctions. The President has the ability to do more, and he’s considering doing more because of the direction this has taken,” he said.The Trump administration has levied an additional 25 per cent tariff on India, taking total duties on Delhi’s trade to 50 per cent, among the highest globally.Rubio said Trump remained “deeply disappointed” with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s course of action in Ukraine despite their Alaska summit in August. “But let’s remember, he didn’t start this war. He inherited it, and all he’s wanted to do is end it,” Rubio said.His remarks followed a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “Our conversation covered a range of bilateral and international issues of current concern.

NEW DELHI: With Supreme Court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from November 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years, amicus curiae and senior advocate Indira Jaising said on Wednesday adolescents, who are attaining puberty sooner than ever, can give mature consent for sexual relationships.With a host of interveners supporting Center's stand against lowering age of consent, Jaising told a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria that in the present age and time, adolescents increasingly getting sexually aware is part and parcel of natural attraction between sexes leading to development of sexual relationships of choice.The amicus argued that there is no empirical data or research to indicate that persons aged between 16 and 18 are incapable of making mature decisions in relation to their sexual preferences and activities. On the contrary, global trends indicate that decisions in relation to sexual activity can be made from the age of 16.She said decriminalising consensual sexual activity between adolescents in the age bracket of 16-18 years along with focus on sexual education will ensure non-abusive and non-exploitative sexual relationships.""It will also lower cases that every HC in this country has to grapple with, where romantic relationships have been criminalised, leading to incarceration of young adolescent couples, which was never the intention of the statute,"" Jaising said.However, as many as seven interveners, including Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti and Centre for Social Development, argued that reducing the age of consent would be misused to manipulate young children and take the crime out of Pocso Act, which was enacted to protect them against sexual exploitation. It may also lead to child marriages, they feared.Jaising said criminalising such consensual sexual relationships would force teenagers to get married to avoid prosecution. Citing National Health and Family Survey-5, she said 45% teenage girls in the age group of 15-19 had sexual intercourse.Dr Ambedkar Jankalyan Samiti apprehended that lowering age of consent will also lead to increasing offences of illegal religious conversion and marriage through mala fide inducement. The Samiti and CSD argued that the age of consent and its genuineness can be decided by courts on a case to case basis without giving blanket immunity from Pocso Act.","Supreme court scheduling day-to-day final hearing from november 12 on petitions seeking lowering of age of consent from 18 to 16 years.

Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance.""

NEW DELHI: A little over four months after India conducted deep precision strikes against Pakistan under Operation Sindoor , the govt has approved General Anil Chauhan’s extension of service as the Chief of Defence Staff and secretary of the Department of Military Affairs till May 30 next year when he turns 65.Gen Chauhan, who was commissioned in the 11 Gorkha Rifles in 1981, was appointed the country’s second CDS in Sept 2022 after his predecessor, Gen Bipin Rawat, died in a helicopter crash in Dec 2021.The appointments committee of the cabinet on Wednesday approved the extension of Gen Chauhan, who was the military advisor to national security advisor Ajit Doval before becoming the CDS, till May 2026 “or until further orders, whichever is earlier”.The move was expected since a CDS can serve till 65, unlike the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs who serve till 62 or for three years, whichever is earlier. Moreover, the CDS’ main charter of spearheading the creation of integrated theatre commands (ITCs) to ensure a cost-effective and unified war-fighting machinery remains unfinished.The Modi govt has been pushing for the long-pending creation of the ITCs, in what will be the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence.Even the BJP manifesto in the run-up to the 2024 general elections had also promised to “establish military theatre commands for more efficient operations” after creating the CDS post in December 2019.While Gen Chauhan has been working towards bringing in some much-needed synergy among the Army, Navy and IAF in operations, logistics, plans and doctrines as well as inter-service prioritization of capital arms procurements, the progress on ITCs has been very slow.India currently has 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which do not have the requisite synergy in planning, logistics and operations. The plan is to have two “adversary-specific” ITCs -- one for the northern borders with China at Lucknow and the other for the western front with Pakistan at Jaipur. The Maritime Theatre Command at Thiruvananthapuram, in turn, will be for the Indian Ocean Region as well as the larger Indo-Pacific, as reported by TOI earlier.","General anil chauhan was appointed the country’s second cds in sept 2022 after his predecessor, gen bipin rawat, died in a helicopter crash in dec 2021.

"Rs 66,500 crore deal for 97 Tejas jets, largest ever, may be inked today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-66500-crore-deal-for-97-tejas-jets-largest-ever-may-be-inked-today/articleshow/124101986.cms,"HAL Battles US Delays, But Delivers Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jets To IAF With ₹67,000 Cr Boost Coming

NEW DELHI: The largest-ever contract worth Rs 66,500 crore for 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is now all set to be inked with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), though the IAF is yet to get even the first such `improved’ jet of the 83 ordered earlier for Rs 46,898 crore in Feb 2021.The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation Tejas could be inked as early as Thursday, a day ahead of the retirement of 36 old MiG-21s that will drag down the IAF to its all-time low of 29 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), defence sources told TOI.Pakistan, in contrast, is cruising close behind with 25 fighter squadrons, and will get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, of course, is leagues ahead, with more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.After Operation Sindoor, which saw Pakistan use Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200-km, an IAF internal assessment has held it will need far more than even its “authorized” 42.5 fighter squadrons to tackle the collusive and fused threat from its adversaries.The IAF has repeatedly set the alarm bells ringing over the excruciatingly slow development saga of the single-engine Tejas fighters, stressing that operational preparedness cannot be sacrificed at the altar of `atmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) endlessly. Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself said IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.All the 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets under the 2021 contract were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security approved the acquisition of another 97 such jets on Aug 19 this year.“The IAF was insistent the new contract should not be inked before deliveries of the earlier 83 jets begin, with HAL being held accountable. The defence ministry, however, must spend its budget within specified timelines…the initial payment will go to HAL once the contract is signed,” a source said.HAL, on its part, contends it will be able to deliver the first two of the 83 Tejas jets in Oct. Deliveries of the 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, now appear to be stabilizing, an official said.GE has delivered three engines till now, with another seven slated by Dec. Thereafter, GE is expected to deliver 20 engines every year. For the 97-jet deal, HAL will ink another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion, as earlier reported by TOI.The IAF, however, wants to accept the first two fighters only if the ongoing firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs from them are successfully completed and properly certified.“The weapon trials and integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system will take time. I don’t see the delivery happening before year-end unless IAF is forced to accept the fighters without certification,” a senior officer said.HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains",The mega 97-jet contract for the fourth-generation tejas could be inked as early as thursday. Iaf has repeatedly set the alarm bells ringing over the excruciatingly slow development saga of the single-engine tejas fighters. The pm-led cabinet committee on security approved the acquisition of another 97 such jets on aug 19 this year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124101989,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1226066,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday highlighted the lack of engagement from the Indian-American community on issues affecting India, such as H-1B visa restrictions and trade tariffs, as he welcomed a visiting US Congressional delegation in New Delhi.Tharoor said the five-member delegation, all Democrats with four of them from California expressed “tremendous interest in India” and reiterated that the US Congress continues to value and support the India–US strategic partnership. Some members of the delegation were headed by Ami Bera, who is of Indian origin, and they shared similar views.“We had a very good visit from a US Congressional delegation which consisted of five members of the US House of Congress. They spoke very warmly and positively of the relationship, and the most important message that came out was that a lot of American opinion, including in Congress, is strongly committed to the Indian relationship despite recent setbacks like the H1-B visa issue, the 50% tariff setback and the sanctions on Chabahar Port ,” Tharoor said.However, the Congress leader also questioned why the Indian-American diaspora had not been vocal on these matters. He pointed out that one of the visiting congresswomen said she had not received a single phone call from any Indian-American voter urging her to support a change of policy.“This is something that is surprising,” Tharoor remarked, adding that the diaspora must speak up if they truly care about India. “If you care about the relationship with your motherland, then you also have to fight for it, speak for it and press your political representatives to stand up for India.”Tharoor noted that the delegation members were already “friends of India” and “well disposed” towards the country. He said the US lawmakers also praised the strength and resilience of the Indian economy and highlighted the contributions of the Indian diaspora, even as concerns were raised over the Trump administration’s steep hike of the H-1B visa fee to USD 100,000.Other issues raised in the meeting included the US sanctions waiver for Iran’s Chabahar Port, which is being developed by India and the 50% tariff on Indian goods. Some US lawmakers criticised the Trump administration for these decisions.“India is valued, and they remain determined to strengthen the relationship despite the recent setbacks we are familiar with,” Tharoor said.The new US policy on H-1B visas has introduced a one-time fee of USD 100,000 for new applicants, which does not apply to existing holders or renewals and is not an annual recurring charge.US President Donald Trump had also imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, doubling duties on key exports such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, furniture and chemicals. The move was seen as a major setback for Indian exporters and trade ties.A parliamentary panel on Tuesday raised concerns over recent US decisions affecting India during an interaction with a visiting delegation of US Congresspersons.

Poll Do you think India should reconsider its energy ties with Russia? Yes, stronger global alignment is needed No, current energy strategy should continue

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope that stronger diplomatic engagement between India and the West could prompt New Delhi to reconsider its energy imports from Russia. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy underscored the need to keep India aligned with the Western bloc amid the ongoing war with Russia.He also called on the West, particularly the United States and Europe, to deepen strategic engagement with India and discourage its energy ties with Russia.“We have to do everything not to withdraw India, and they'll change their attitude to the Russian energy sector. I'm sure,” Zelenskyy told Fox’s Bret Baier, suggesting that greater diplomatic efforts could encourage India to rethink its approach to sourcing energy from Russia.While acknowledging concerns over India’s energy imports, he expressed confidence in US President Donald Trump’s ability to manage those issues. “Yes, we had these questions with energy, but I think President Trump can manage it,” he said.His remarks came in the broader context of discussing global alignments, particularly countries perceived as closer to Russia. Commenting on Iran, the Ukrainian president stated: “Iran will never be on our side.Because it will never be on the side of the United States.”Also read: 'Without China, Russia is nothing’ - Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Beijing could pressure Moscow to end war; criticizes silence He went on to add, “I think India's mostly with us,” reinforcing his belief that India remains a potential strategic partner for the West.Zelenskyy also indicated that closer cooperation between Europe and India could help shift New Delhi’s position. “With Europeans, make more close and strong relationship with India,” he added.He also spoke positively about his recent interaction with Trump, describing him as supportive of Ukraine's position. “President Trump was more positive. He showed that he wants to support Ukraine to the very end,” Zelenskyy said.“We are ready to finish this war as soon as possible. He wants and I want and our people want,” he added, while also noting that Trump recognises the challenges posed by Russia. “He understands that Putin doesn't want that and is not winning but he says to everyone that he’ll win.”","Ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy called on the west to deepen strategic engagement with india and discourage its energy ties with russia. “we have to do everything not to withdraw india, and they'll change their attitude to the russian energy sector.
