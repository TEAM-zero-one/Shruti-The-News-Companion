EU-India summit on Jan 27; EU says both can protect rules-based international order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-india-summit-on-jan-27-eu-says-both-can-protect-rules-based-international-order/articleshow/126556476.cms,"Image: IANS

European Council President António Luís Santos da Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit India for the 16th India-EU summit on January 27 and also participate in the Republic Day parade as chief guests a day earlier, said the government in an official announcement.The summit will be the culmination of months of hard work by both sides to ramp up bilateral ties that has seen the EU finalising a new strategic agenda for India amidst mounting global uncertainties and its own rupturing transatlantic alliance.Both sides are currently scrambling to finalise a free trade agreement (FTA) that tops the list of expected deliverables from the summit, along with a formal EU-India defence and security partnership to facilitate defence industrial cooperation despite friction over India’s ties with Russia.According to the EU, trade, security, defence, clean transition and people-to-people contact will top the agenda of the discussions. “India is a crucial partner for the EU. Together, we share the capacity and responsibility to protect the rules-based international order. This meeting will be a key opportunity to build on our partnership and drive progress in our cooperation,” said Costa.This will also be the first time that the leaders will attend the Republic Day parade celebrations as guests of honour signalling, according to the 27-nation bloc, the strengthening of the bilateral relationship between the EU and India.“In October 2025, the Council of the EU endorsed the new strategic EU-India agenda, and its objective of further developing EU-India ties. In so doing, it placed specific focus on prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence, and connectivity and global issues,” it said in a simultaneous announcement about the visit.On the trade front, both sides have found differences related to critical areas like cars, steel and EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a carbon tax on certain goods, the hardest to address. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri had said last week that the CBAM issue was being discussed and India’s effort is to ensure that all its interests are safeguarded when the FTA is finalised.Brussels also wants commitment to the Paris Agreement, the international treaty for climate action, enshrined in the FTA even though India sees it as a sovereignty issue that should not be mixed with trade. Both sides are hoping political intervention at the highest level will help break this deadlock.“India and EU are strategic partners since 2004. The 15th India-EU Summit was held virtually on 15 July 2020. Bilateral ties have expanded and deepened across a wide range of areas, particularly following the historic visit of EU College of Commissioners to India in February 2025,” said the Indian government, adding that the visit will advance cooperation in areas of mutual interest.Progress is also expected in efforts by the EU to advance, within the IMEC framework, the EU-Africa-India Digital Corridor through a submarine cable system connecting Europe to India via the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Eastern Africa. This EU initiative, as the new strategic agenda says, will provide ultra- high-speed, secure, and diversified data connectivity resilient to disruptions caused by natural disasters or acts of sabotage.",European council president antónio luís santos da costa and european commission president ursula von der leyen will visit india for the 16th india-eu summit on january 27.

Democracy delivers in India: PM Modi at CW meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/democracy-delivers-in-india-pm-modi-at-cw-meet/articleshow/126555452.cms,"PM Modi said India has been voicing the interests of Global South countries at international platforms

NEW DELHI: Democratic spirit runs in India’s veins and is underpinned by its values, PM Narendra Modi said Thursday, asserting that the country had belied post-Independence apprehensions about its future as it turned its diversity into strength and showed the world that its democratic institutions and processes deliver stability, speed and scale.Addressing the 28th conference of speakers and presiding officers of the Commonwealth at the central hall of Samvidhan Sadan, the old Parliament building, after inaugurating the event, he said democracy in India means last-mile delivery for citizens and working for everyone’s welfare without any discrimination. “In India, democracy delivers,” he said.With representatives from many Global South countries present in the audience, Modi said India has been strongly voicing their interests at international platforms and has striven to ensure that its innovations benefit them. Under its presidency of G20, India put Global South’s concerns at the centre of global agenda.“When the world is undergoing unprecedented changes, then it is also time for Global South to chart a new path,” Modi said, adding that India is home to over 50% of the population of Commonwealth countries and is fulfilling its commitment to their sustainable development goals. In this context, he recalled vaccines and other medical aid India had provided to many countries during the Covid outbreak.Turning to India’s ancient democratic culture, he said its over 5,000-year-old Vedas have referred to assemblies where people met to deliberate and arrive at agreements on different issues while the Buddhist Sangha used to have open discussions and made decisions through consensus or voting.He said, “A 10th-century inscription from Tamil Nadu describes a village assembly that worked with democratic values. There were clear rules for accountability and decisionmaking. Our democratic values have been tested by time, supported by diversity and strengthened generation after generation.”Hundreds of languages are spoken in India’s diverse democracy, while over 900 TV channels are broadcast and thousands of newspapers and periodicals are published, he said. “Very few societies manage diversity at this scale. India celebrates such diversity because our democracy has a strong foundation. India is called the Mother of Democracy.” He noted that with 980-million registered voters, the 2024 LS election was not only the largest democratic exercise in human history but also witnessed record participation of women.Addressing delegates, who included 61 presiding officers from 46 countries, Speaker Om Birla flagged concerns over the misuse of emerging technologies like AI, while noting these have also boosted efficiency. Their misuse has presented challenges of misinformation, cybercrime and social disharmony, and effective solutions are needed to counter the threat posed to democracies, he said. India’s over seven-decade-long parliamentary journey has been strengthened through people-centric policies and welfare-focused legislation, he said.",Pm modi said india has been voicing the interests of global south countries at international platforms.

U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

H-1B Visa Stamping Delays

Indian H-1B visa holders are facing a fresh headache! Amidst the Donald Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, existing H-1B visa holders now face the prospect of job loss, salary cuts and local income tax payouts due to ongoing visa stamping delays.Indian professionals holding H-1B visas who have travelled to India for visa renewals are increasingly finding themselves stranded because of prolonged stamping delays. According to immigration experts, many such workers have been unable to return to the United States after the Trump administration tightened scrutiny of applicants’ social media activity, leading to longer processing times.With visa interview appointments being deferred to March, April or even later, job prospects have become uncertain for some, particularly those employed by smaller firms and startups, according to an ET report.Not only that, any extended stay in India carries the risk of income tax implications. Individuals who stay in the country beyond specified thresholds may become liable to pay Indian income tax, either as non-residents or as tax residents, adding to their financial burden.US companies with employees unable to return are now reportedly consulting immigration specialists, legal advisers and professional services firms to address any compliance and taxation relation challenges.In some cases, employers are even directly approaching US embassies and consulates in an effort to secure earlier interview slots for their staff.“If for any reason, employees of US companies need to spend time in India, there could be potential tax implications both for such employees as well as their US employers that need careful evaluation,” Parizad Sirwalla, partner and national head, tax – global mobility services, at KPMG was quoted as saying.Ankita Singh, founder of law firm Sarvaank Associates notes that if an H-1B visa holder stays in India for 182 days or more during a financial year, they are treated as a tax resident in India. To manage the situation of employees who are unable to return to the United States, some American companies have permitted limited remote working from India or have even temporarily shifted such staff to their India-based subsidiaries.However, it’s not as simple as that. Experts note that, from an employer’s standpoint, this arrangement requires a careful assessment of whether the employee’s work activities in India could give rise to any corporate tax exposure for the overseas entity. Singh says that US employers are currently more focused on compliance risks and potential tax liabilities than on immigration-related issues when they allow remote working from India.“The question of H-1B professionals continuing to work remotely from India during visa stamping delays is being addressed through legally cautious, interim arrangements rather than any settled legal position,” said Tanmay Banthia, partner, Taraksh Lawyers and Consultants.Banthia also said that pay arrangements during this period of remote work from India vary from company to company and are guided by contractual terms and internal policies. At the same time, some professionals stranded in India have approached legal advisers in an effort to avoid losing their jobs.“There are a few instances where the firms in the US have given an ultimatum to employees to join back once they exhaust their paid leaves or face termination,” Sukanya Raman, country head at immigration law firm Davies & Associates, told ET.Prolonged visa processing delays have begun to take a heavy personal and financial toll on affected workers and their families. According to Raman, some employers are attempting to ease the situation by approaching US consulates to seek faster visa appointment dates for employees stranded in India. However, many large corporations are simultaneously limiting the type of work these employees are permitted to carry out remotely from India.The disruptions have also led to families being separated, with cases where one spouse or children remain in the United States while the main income earner is stuck in India, or the reverse, said Ankita Singh of Sarvaank Associates. In such situations, families often continue to bear US living costs, including rent, vehicle leases and utility bills, even as incomes are reduced or temporarily halted.Smaller US firms, particularly those without the legal resources to manage such complex cross-border arrangements, have in some cases asked affected employees to resign or take unpaid leave. A range of human resources challenges has also emerged, including difficulties in assessing performance, restrictions on carrying out core job responsibilities, questions around insurance and benefits coverage during overseas stays, as well as issues related to time zone differences and team coordination.Immigration specialists also noted that H-1B visa holders are facing increased scrutiny at US ports of entry, with some being denied re-entry over concerns related to unauthorised remote work while abroad. “Prolonged periods spent outside the US—nearing six months—can invite questions at the port of entry about whether the individual has effectively disengaged from US employment,” said Keshav Singhania, head - Private Client at law firm Singhania & Co.","Indian professionals holding h-1b visas who have travelled to india for visa renewals are increasingly finding themselves stranded because of prolonged stamping delays.

Students from Golestan University and a few students from SBUMS and TUMS are likely to be part of the first evacuation batch. The final passenger list will be shared later tonight once confirmed by the authorities.Iran has been witnessing nationwide protests for over two weeks, initially triggered by anger over the collapse of the national currency and worsening economic conditions. The unrest has since escalated into broader protests against the country’s theocratic leadership, driven by discontent over economic mismanagement and restrictions on personal freedoms.The evacuation move has brought relief to families, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, who have been concerned about the safety of students amid the deteriorating security situation in Iran.",'leave by any means': india issues fresh advisory as iran protests intensify across cities.

'Leave By Any Means': India Issues Fresh Advisory As Iran Protests Intensify Across Cities

""IndiGo flight 6E1808 is now the last non-Iran-registered passenger aircraft in Iranian airspace,”

Flightradar24 said on X at 3.49 am (IST) Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Flights between India and the west will get longer as airlines have stopped overflying the Iranian and Iraqi airspace due to the evolving situation in the region. The sudden closure of Iranian airspace for some time on Wednesday-Thursday night meant Air India had to cancel Thursday morning’s Delhi-New York JFK (AI 101), Delhi-Newark (AI 105) and Mumbai-JFK (AI 119). The return flights were consequentially also cancelled.IndiGo’s Baku-Delhi flight early Thursday morning returned to the Azerbaijan capital within an hour as it was to overfly Iran after crossing the Caspian Sea. Air India will cancel some flights where rerouting is not possible. For Indian carriers, avoiding Iran and Iraq will mean not overflying the entire stretch from Iraq right upto Pakistan. Accordingly, IndiGo could take a call on its Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights shortly as flying between those places and India will mean taking an extraordinary long route that will require a felling halt some place like Jordan.The Iranian airspace was suddenly closed on Wednesday-Thursday night.A notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued Thursday at 22:15 (UTC or GMT) said: “Tehran flight information region (FIR) closed to all flights except international civil arrivals and departures to and from Tehran FIR with prior permission from Iran Civil Aviation Authority.”Subsequently another NOTAM was issued saying “Tehran FIR resumed normal operations” but multiple airlines are avoiding the airspace for safety reasons.Air India said on X Thursday morning: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled. We request passengers to check the status of their flights on our website before heading to the airport. Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption. Safety of our passengers and crew remain top priority.”A Lufthansa spokesperson said: “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the Lufthansa Group has decided, after careful evaluation, to operate flights to and from Tel Aviv and Amman as day flights from Thursday, January 15 up to and including Monday, January 19, 2026. This means that crews fly back immediately afterwards without an overnight stay on site. In some cases, there may also be flight cancellations. In addition, Iranian and Iraqi airspace will be circumnavigated by all Lufthansa Group airlines until further notice.”“The Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to assess the situation in the coming days. Affected passengers will be automatically rebooked and proactively contacted. Alternatively, guests can rebook to a later travel date. The safety of our guests and crew members is always our top priority,” the spokesperson said.A Jan 11 analyst update by Osprey Flight Solutions titled “Iran: Main urban centres: Further violent clashes near certain in the short term amid deteriorating security situation” says: “Operators are advised that the security situation in Iran's main urban centres remains fluid and subject to rapid change amid the ongoing violence. While airport operations have remained largely unaffected, disruption is possible in the short term, to include airport worker involvement in protests, impacting staffing levels at facilities. Additionally, fuel shortages at airports and direct protest action at/near facilities are possible in the short term….”","Indigo flight 6e1808 is now the last non-iran-registered passenger aircraft in iranian airspace.

NEW DELHI: Defence sources on Thursday told ANI that two incident of drone spotting were reported in the Jammu sector, marking third such incident in recent days. Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems measures were activated by the Indian Army following the sightings, the sources said.The latest sightings come on Army Day, as the Indian Army underlined its focus on future-ready capabilities and indigenous systems. Speaking after the Army Day parade in Jaipur, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi said the Army is moving ahead with well-trained soldiers, modern equipment and multi-domain operational capabilities, with technology playing a key role in enhancing combat readiness.Referring to Operation Sindoor , General Dwivedi said it established a “new normal” by demonstrating the Army’s ability to respond with speed, coordination and precision. “The operation reflected a mature and confident force, capable of safeguarding national interests through measured, firm and responsible action,” he said.The drone sightings follow a series of similar incidents earlier this week along the Line of Control and the International Border in Jammu and Kashmir. On Tuesday, ANI sources said suspected Pakistani drones were sighted for the second time in 48 hours in areas along the LoC and the International Border, including Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts.Counter-UAS measures were deployed, and ground search operations were launched in several locations.In the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district, Army troops opened fire with medium and light machine guns after observing drone movement over Gania-Kalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said. Another drone was spotted over Khabbar village in the Teryath area of Rajouri district, while a drone-like object with a blinking light was seen hovering over Chak Babral village in the Ramgarh sector of Samba district. Similar activity was reported in the Mankote sector of Poonch district.The heightened alert along the border comes amid a strong warning from General Dwivedi to Pakistan over active terror camps across the LoC and the International Border. “At least 6 terror camps still active across the LoC & 2 across the International Border after Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Will act, if any (nefarious) attempts are carried out,” the Army chief said during the Army Day press conference.","Multiple pak drones sighted in j&k, second time in 48 hours; locals recall horror.

SRINAGAR/LUCKNOW: Ladakh and UP saw a coordinated surge of pro-Iran sentiment as thousands rallied in Kargil district Wednesday and prominent Shia clerics in Lucknow called for sanctions relief, dialogue and Indian support for Tehran.In Kargil, a Shia-majority district in eastern Ladakh bordering PoK, large crowds gathered at multiple locations to back Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and denounce the US and Israel. The rally, organised by Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, was led by chairman Sheikh Sadiq Rajai, who accused Washington and Tel Aviv of seeking to dominate the region and destabilise Iran.“We have come out to protest against America and to stand with the brave people of Iran,” Rajai said, urging Islamic nations to unite against what he called US “evil designs”.Demonstrators waved banners praising Ruhollah Khomeini and Khamenei and shouted slogans in Persian and Urdu, while shouting “down with America” and “down with Israel”. Several women addressed the gathering. Police and paramilitary forces were deployed. Officials said protests remained peaceful and also took place in some blocks Thursday.Asgar Ali Karbali, a senior community activist in Ladakh, said Iran has long supported oppressed communities from Lebanon to Palestine.“With this huge protest in Kargil today, we want to show that Iran is not alone,” he said.On Thursday, Shia clerics and community figures in UP echoed support for Tehran and warned against escalation.Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, a leading cleric in Lucknow, said Western sanctions have crippled Iran’s economy and created unrest. “On allegations of uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons, Western powers imposed sanctions on a Shia country. But in reality, they want Iran’s oil… Remove the sanctions, and Iran will flourish,” he said, urging New Delhi to back Tehran rather than remain neutral.Maulana Yasoob Abbas of All India Shia Personal Law Board accused the US and Israel of fuelling unrest and dismissed reports of mass casualties, saying life in Iran was normal. Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, chairman of Islamic Centre of India and Shahi Imam of Lucknow, said war was no solution and called on the UN to intervene, stressing Iran’s sovereignty and historic ties with India.From Kintoor village in Barabanki district — about 30km southeast of Lucknow and ancestral home of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s grandfather — Dr Rehan Kazmi said Western media was distorting events, citing family contacts in Iran who reported large pro-govt rallies.“If Israel or the US attacks, Iran will respond strongly. They have been prepared for this for the past 20 years,” Kazmi said.","Ladakh and up saw a coordinated surge of pro-iran sentiment as thousands rallied in kargil district wednesday.

Their consistent calls for secession of an integral part of India amounted to a complete ""rejection of India's constitutional framework"", he added.The court cited instances where Andrabi sought support from Pak-based platforms and referred to a 2018 interview in which she stated that ""gun is a must"" for a referendum. The court said such statements went beyond political dissent and reflected endorsement of violent means to achieve secession.On defence's claim of right to self-determination based on UN resolutions, court flagged a clear contradiction. It noted that while the accused claimed such a right, they simultaneously asserted that Kashmir was part of Pakistan and under ""illegal occupation"" by India.","Asiya andrabi and her associates did not bear an allegiance to the constitution of india, a delhi court said.

NEW DELHI: Abdul Rauf, a top-ranking commander of Lashkar-e-Taiba , has publicly acknowledged the devastating impact of the Indian military's Operation Sindoor on the group's headquarters. Addressing a fresh cohort of graduates at a ceremony in Muridke, he provided a rare and vivid account of the destruction visited upon their primary training facility during the strikes on May 6 and 7.Rauf's address focused heavily on the physical obliteration of the site, specifically referencing a structure used as a mosque that served as a central hub for the organisation. He described a scene of total ruin, noting that the building which once stood there has completely collapsed, leaving the ground unusable for their usual gatherings.""What happened on May 6-7, that place is no longer a mosque. Today, we cannot even sit there. It is finished; it has collapsed,"" he said.His testimony serves as the most detailed Lashkar confirmation yet of the significant losses in the Indian strike. This admission is particularly striking given the group's tendency to downplay or outrightly ignore operational losses in an effort to maintain an image of invulnerability.Beyond the physical wreckage, the commander also inadvertently highlighted the strategic pressure the organisation felt leading up to the strike.He revealed that the trainees participating in the graduation had actually been evacuated from the Muridke camp just moments before the Indian missiles struck.Rauf is a prominent ideological and operational leader who famously presided over the funeral rites for those killed during the initial waves of the strikes. While images of those burials had previously circulated and hinted at the severity of the casualties, Rauf's latest remarks mark the final confirmation, leaving no room for denials.","Abdul rauf, a top-ranking commander of lashkar-e-taiba, has publicly acknowledged the devastating impact of the indian military's operation sindoor.

MCX Gold has regained its bullish momentum after a short consolidation phase and is now trading around the all-time high of 143,500. With upward strength reasserting itself and minimal signs of a reversal, the rally is likely to extend to higher levels. The recent breakout reinforces the strength of the move, and the overall outlook remains positive as long as prices stay above the breakout zone.From a weekly perspective, the 139,000 level remains a key support area, marking the lower boundary of the consolidation range. Any dip toward this zone is expected to attract fresh buying interest, thereby cushioning the downside in the near term. Holding above this support strengthens the bullish structure and maintains positive momentum.Gold appears well placed to advance toward the 151,000 level in the upcoming sessions. This prospective rise is in line with the broader bullish trend and underscores the strength of prevailing market momentum. Additionally, a decisive and sustained breakout above the consolidation range resistance has attracted fresh buying interest, reinforcing positive sentiment and setting the stage for a continued upward move.Overall, Gold remains well positioned to maintain its positive bias, with the broader technical structure clearly favouring trend continuation. As long as prices stay above the crucial 139,000 support, the bullish setup remains valid. With momentum indicators and overall market sentiment continuing to be supportive, the precious metal looks well placed for further upside in the sessions ahead.MCX Silver has recorded a new all-time high this week, continuing its pattern of higher highs seen over the past several months. With little indication of a slowdown, the overall bias stays positive, and any pullbacks are likely to attract buying interest. We advise trading in line with the prevailing trend, which remains strongly bullish.Silver’s early-week rally has underscored a renewed strength in the trend, increasing the probability of further upside. As long as prices hold above the weekly support levels, the bullish bias should remain intact. The immediate key support lies around the 266,000 mark, which may offer a favourable buying opportunity. Any dip toward this zone is expected to draw fresh buying interest, aiding price stability and preserving upward momentum.On the upside, Silver appears well placed to test the 320,000 resistance in the near to medium term.
