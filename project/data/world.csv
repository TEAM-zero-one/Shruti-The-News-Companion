AHMEDABAD: A wave of despair spread across many parts of Gujarat as 33 illegal immigrants, including 13 women and eight children, landed in Ahmedabad early Thursday from Amritsar after they were deported from US. Faces covered by masks, without any luggage and a few with backpacks, they were taken to Gujarat Police vehicles stationed at the airport and whisked away to their homes.Having paid Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore to chase their 'US dreams', all they were left with were shattered dreams and mounting debts.All of them were deported under the 'catch and release' policy of Trump administration and were part of a larger group of 104 Indians who were sent back from the US this week.""My sister was handcuffed during the deportation.

""They were smuggled into US through Mexico border,"" said a source connected with human smuggling network. ""The smugglers pushed them to enter US way before Trump took the oath, fearing stricter immigration policies. But for some reason, they could not cross over in time.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk-led task force – Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ) recently announced the cancellation of 20 consulting contracts on February 3, primarily related to ""strategic communication"" and ""executive coaching,"" resulting in a $26 million savings for taxpayers.Announcing the same on X (formerly known as Twitter), it wrote “This morning, 20 consulting contracts, mostly focused on “strategic communication” and “executive coaching,” were terminated for immediate savings of $26mm.”Quoting the post, the Tesla CEO wrote “Another description for these types of payments is ‘ money laundering ’,”.This comes after reports claimed that DOGE gained access to sensitive Treasury data, including Social Security and Medicare payments to focus on identifying and eliminating waste and fraud. However, this rumoured access raised concerns among Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups regarding potential privacy violations and the extent of DOGE's authority.Replying to this, Musk claimed that Treasury officials approved payments to fraudulent and terrorist groups without scrutiny, alleging they were instructed never to deny payments.President Donald Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) through an executive order, appointing the billionaire Elon Musk to lead the initiative. DOGE's primary objective is to modernize and streamline federal operations, aiming to reduce government spending and enhance productivity.Talking about DOGE, Democrat leader Chuck Schumer recently said, ""The American people will not stand for an un-elected secret group to run rampant through the executive branch.

As the 2025 Invictus games in Vancouver and Whistler are underway, experts are calling on the royal family to mend their fractured relationship with Prince Harry ahead of the 2027 event in Birmingham, England.PR expert Ryan McCormick told The Mirror US that the royal family should extend an olive branch to Harry, as it would not only be beneficial for their public image but also send a strong message of unity. “I think the Royal family should attend the event (it's good PR for them) and should also include Harry,” McCormick said. “When respected leaders and figureheads can show that differences can be put aside, it can inspire others to do the same”, Ryan added.McCormick also encouraged Harry to move forward with his Invictus games commitments despite recent health challenges within the royal family. Kate Middleton recently announced she is in remission after undergoing chemotherapy, while King Charles continues treatment for cancer.“Yes, Charles' diagnosis (and Kate's cancer treatments) has been an unpredictable cloud of uncertainty but, forging ahead with the games focuses on the beauty of life in the moment,” McCormick added.Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were recently spotted at the Invictus games at Rogers Arena in Canada. As per The Mirror, the couple looked cheerful, with Meghan showing affectionate gestures toward Harry, which body language expert Judi James described as “a very tender, playful moment.”However, questions remain over Meghan’s potential attendance at the 2027 Invictus games in Birmingham.Royal expert Kinsey Schofield told The Mirror US that Meghan may opt out of the UK event due to personal concerns. “I currently lean towards Meghan not attending Prince Harry's 2027 Invictus games in the UK because we have seen Meghan prioritize herself and her mental health over the last few years,” Schofield explained, adding that Harry’s security concerns and Meghan’s fear of negative media attention might influence her decision.Prince Harry launched the Invictus games in 2014 to support sick and injured veterans through sports, an initiative that has gained international recognition.","Royal family urged to 'put difference aside' and reconcile with prince harry ahead of 2027 invictus games in birmingham, england.

Israeli forces have begun withdrawing from the strategic Netzarim corridor in Gaza as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement with Hamas , an Israeli official confirmed on Sunday.The move is seen as a significant step in implementing the terms of the 42-day truce.New agency AP quoted an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity and said that the withdrawal fulfills one of Israel’s commitments under the agreement. While the exact number of troops being pulled back remains unclear, the decision marks a shift in Israel’s military presence in the region.The Netzarim corridor is a strip of land that bisects northern and southern Gaza, effectively restricting movement between the two areas. At the start of the ceasefire, Israel permitted Palestinians to cross the corridor under controlled conditions.Now, with the troop withdrawal, Palestinians are allowed to move freely to the north without Israeli inspections, which is a key requirement under the ceasefire deal.The truce’s first phase includes the gradual release of 33 Israeli hostages by Hamas in exchange for several conditions: a pause in hostilities, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners , and an increased flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.However, with the ceasefire reaching its halfway mark, concerns remain over the negotiations for an extension.The second phase of the agreement is expected to involve the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the establishment of what has been termed a “sustainable calm.” However, diplomatic progress has been slow.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to send a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in the ceasefire discussions. However, as per AP, the delegation consists of lower-ranking officials, sparking speculation that a major breakthrough may not be imminent.Netanyahu is also expected to hold a high-level meeting with Cabinet ministers this week to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire deal. However, no specific date has been set, leaving the future of the truce uncertain.","Israeli forces have begun withdrawing from the strategic netzarim corridor in gaza as part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement with hamas.

His long-awaited return to Israel was marred by unimaginable heartbreak after he learned that his wife, Leanne, and daughters, Noya (16) and Yahel (13), were killed during the October 7 Hamas attack .In a heart-wrenching moment captured on video, Sharabi was seen expressing his joy upon release, saying, ""I am very happy today to return to my wife and daughters,"" unaware of the tragedy that had struck his family in Kibbutz Be'eri. According to BBC, as he was set to be freed, he received the devastating news that his brother, Yossi Sharabi, had died in captivity, with his body still held in Gaza.Sharabi was among three hostages freed as part of a prisoner exchange deal under an internationally brokered ceasefire agreement, which saw Israel release 183 Palestinian prisoners . The other two hostages, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy, were handed over to the Red Cross before reuniting with their families in Israel.In South Wales, Gillian and Pete Brisley, Sharabi's in-laws, watched his release on TV, clutching a teddy bear that once belonged to their late daughter, Leanne. The stuffed toy served as a poignant reminder of the family's profound loss and the emotional ties that spanned continents. ""While Gill was crying, she was holding on to the teddy bear, which was Lianne's from the age of about 10,"" Pete Brisley shared. ""When we went to the house [in Kibbutz Be'eri], it was filthy, bullet holes everywhere. We tidied up so if Eli wanted to come home to it, it looked reasonable because it was an absolute shambles.""For months, the Brisleys had received no news of Sharabi's fate until a sudden call informed them of his pending release. Watching him walk free was both a relief and a shock. ""He looks as though he's been to Belsen,"" Pete remarked, comparing Sharabi's gaunt, frail appearance to survivors of World War II concentration camps. ""The spark that always glinted in his eyes was gone.""The release also unleashed a flood of suppressed grief. ""The emotion of seeing him brought the grief of losing our girls right up to our throats,"" said Gillian Brisley. ""We just sat here and cried—for our loss, with relief that Eli was on his way home, and for Yossi. Just, you know, mixed emotions.""Sharabi was informed of his family's deaths only after returning to Israel. The family had hoped he would have been told earlier to help him process the grief gradually, said Stephen Brisley, Leanne's brother.Meanwhile, Palestinian prisoners released in the exchange were welcomed in Ramallah and other parts of the occupied West Bank, with representatives claiming many required medical care, though specific details were not provided.","Eli sharabi was among three hostages freed as part of a prisoner exchange deal under an internationally brokered ceasefire agreement.

Sam Nujoma , Namibia’s first president and the leader who guided the country to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990, died on Saturday at the age of 95.His death was announced by Namibia’s current president Nangolo Mbumba on Sunday. He said that Nujoma passed away in a hospital in Windhoek after being ill for three weeks, New York Times reported.Nujoma was a key figure in Namibia’s liberation struggle, heading the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO) since its formation in 1960. He led a Soviet-backed guerrilla army in a protracted war against South Africa, which had occupied Namibia despite international condemnation.While Nujoma himself did not participate directly in combat, he was the face of the resistance, balancing diplomacy with armed struggle.Independence was ultimately achieved through a US-brokered agreement, which saw South Africa withdraw from Namibia in exchange for the removal of Cuban troops from Angola, accordng to the New York Times. Despite being excluded from negotiations, Nujoma became Namibia’s first president and remained in power for 15 years, securing a constitutional amendment to run for a third term in 1999.His leadership helped bring national reconciliation and economic stability to Namibia, with even political opponents acknowledging his role in uniting a deeply divided nation, as per the news agency AP.However, Nujoma was also known for his autocratic tendencies, anti-Western rhetoric, and controversial stances, including his support for Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe and his harsh anti-homosexuality remarks. In 2001, he warned that gays and lesbians would be arrested, jailed, or deported.Despite his fiery leadership style, Nujoma remained a revered figure in Namibia. His image appears on national currency, and a six-meter-tall statue stands outside the Namibian Independence Museum. Even after retirement, he remained politically vocal, calling for renegotiation of Germany’s compensation for its colonial-era genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples, as per AFP.A symbol of Africa’s independence era, Nujoma’s legacy places him among figures like Nelson Mandela, Kenneth Kaunda, and Samora Machel.",Sam nujoma was namibia’s first president and guided the country to independence from apartheid south africa in 1990.

Seth Bell, 46, who witnessed and recorded the incident, described how Shalash aggressively entered the man's personal space while shouting offensive language linked to Middle Eastern conflicts.""As I got closer, I heard the word 'Jew' being thrown around, and 'genocide,' 'Israel,' and 'Palestine,' and I just knew immediately,"" Bell recounted. ""She was equating some random Jewish guy with what was going on in the Middle East, which is classic antisemitism.""When Bell confronted Shalash, asking if she was antisemitic, she launched into a hate-filled tirade, captured on video. In the footage, Shalash can be heard shouting, ""F--k the Jews, I love Jesus… I demand Jihad! I want ISIS to kill all of you! I am conspiring with Hamas, Palestinian Jihad, and with Isis, I am conspiring with them!"" while attempting to swat Bell's phone from his hand.Shalash allegedly struck Bell on the head and kicked at him during the altercation. The video also shows her sitting defiantly in an elevator, refusing to leave.

Shalash, dressed in a long skirt, heels, and a purple sweater emblazoned with ""PINK,"" was initially transported to Bellevue Hospital for a psychological evaluation.The reasons behind Shalash's presence in New York City and any connection to the victim remain unclear.

Why JD Vance and Ro Khanna sparred on X



Who is Katherine Long? Why Elon Musk calls her disgusting



After Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) made headlines for recommending shutting down of USAID, DOGE became the headlines when its 25-year-old staff, Marko Elez resigned following the unearthing of his past social media posts in which he called himself a racist. Those posts were not made in his name, but a pseudonym account which was suspended in December last year when Elez started to work for DOGE.This snowballed into a major controversy as little was known about DOGE so far but now that they started visiting federal agencies, bureaucrats claimed that they are mostly youngsters with questionable background and no eligibility to question federal workers. They are all ""tech kids"" who dropped out of college.Wall Street Journal reported that Marko Elez made several problematic posts in the past like: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc. Controversy over his past posts made him to resign, the Wall Street Journal said.Elon Musk ran a poll on X whether DOGE should rehire him and as the majority voters were in favor of Marko Elez, Musk said he would rehire him. But Musl admitted that Elez made some mistakes. ""To err is human,"" Musk wrote.Vice president JD Vance offered his opinion on Elon Musk's poll on Marko Elez and said he does not agree with what Elez wrote in past but he also believes that past social media activities should not ruin his life. Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna asked him whether he would seek an apology for the anti-India statement. ""Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna wrote as their kids have Indian connection -- Ro Khanna is an Indian-American and JD Vance's wife Usha Vance has Indian origin.The 'children' part seemingly irked JD Vance and he took it as an emotional blackmail. ""I cannot overstate how much I loathe this emotional blackmail pretending to be concern. My kids, god willing, will be risk takers. They won't think constantly about whether a flippant comment or a wrong viewpoint will follow them around for the rest of their lives. They will tell stupid jokes. They will develop views that they later think are wrong or even gross. I made mistakes as a kid, and thank God I grew up in a culture that encouraged me to grow and learn and feel remorse when I screwed up and offer grace when others did,"" Vance wrote.Ro Khanna replied that he was only doing an exchange of ideas.Amid all this, journalist Katherine Long who wrote the Wall Street Journal piece on Marko Elez drew the ire of Elon Musk who called her disgusting. Social media posts claimed Long had USAID links.","Jd vance and marko elez fought on x over 'india-hater' markoelez whom elon musk is rehiring.

Donald Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has revealed in a podcast that DOGE staff have completely changed the work culture as they are working very late. The facilities people initially did not know what to do with them as they've never seen people working so late on a Friday night, David Sacks said as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is creating ripples -- for many reasons.Sharing an anecdote about DOGE, David Sacks said he went to greet them and the room was full of young people. ""I think they all are engineers. They were wearing suits and ties. They were working really late,"" Sacks said adding that new facilities access had to be created for them.Elon Musk recently said his team DOGE is working 120 hours a week. ""Our bureaucratic opponents optimistically work 40 hours a week. That is why they are losing so fast,"" Elon Musk wrote as he made it a DOGE vs bureaucracy fight as DOGE has been asked to cut the cost.DOGE was announced after Donald Trump won the election and between November to January 20, DOGE started working secretively. The meetings used to be held in Starlink offices. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy were the two co-chiefs of the department. Ramaswamy exited DOGE to run for the governor election in Ohio. Now a complete Elon Musk show, DOGE gained prominence as they got an office in the White House. DOGE staff got access to the federal payments system. They are visiting agency offices and are asking federal employees to justify their jobs in 15 minutes. Elon Musk has already announced shutting down USAID, next on their anvil is the education department.Though DOGE has understandably many staff, four to five youngsters have gained prominence as they made those acrimonious visits to government offices. According to bureaucrats, all of them are youngsters aged between 19 to 25 years.DOGE has created a digital tracker that aims to monitor the amount of taxpayers' dollars that the departments saved. On Saturday, it showed the savings as $36.73 billion which is 1.8 per cent of their goal of two trillion that has to be achieved within 511 days.",Elon musk's doge is working overtime to meet their saving goals.

Trump's Immigration Policy Changes Could Impact Indian H-1B Visa Holders and Families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/immigration-policy-changes-being-considered-by-trump-administration-may-hit-indians-on-green-card-queues-hard/articleshow/118013429.cms,"Poll Does Stricter U.S. Immigration Policy Violate Human Rights? No, It’s Necessary Yes, It’s Unfair

Several steps being considered by the administration of US President Donald Trump are cause for worry for thousands of Indians in the US, who are on H-1B work permits and face long green card backlog.First, the potential revocation of birthright citizenship, for which President Trump has signed an executive order, is a deeply concerning issue for Indian families on H-1B visas who are expecting children in the United States. While this policy is currently being challenged in court and remains on hold, its implementation—however unlikely—would have profound implications.One of the most significant challenges would be the increase in the number of “aging-out” children, who are not covered under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and would lose the automatic legal status that US birthright citizenship provides. There are over 200,000 young immigrants, a large number of them Indians, who went to America with their parents as dependent children and then aged-out when they turned 21, according to estimates. They have to either self-deport, despite having lived in the US for several years and grown up and attended school and college there, or become undocumented immigrants.The issue of children aging out of dependent visa status is already one of the most challenging problems for Indian professionals on H-1B visas, and any policy change revoking birthright citizenship would only exacerbate it.“This would add further complexity to an already overburdened green card backlog, disproportionately affecting H-1B holders from India. Given the existing decades-long wait times for employment-based green cards, the inability to secure US citizenship at birth could leave these children in a precarious immigration status as they reach adulthood,” Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting skilled Indians stuck in long green card queues, told the Times of India.The issue of birthright citizenship is currently being challenged in the US courts, and the executive order attempting to revoke it is on hold. Given the strong constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, any attempt to alter this long-standing principle is likely to face significant legal hurdles.Earlier this week, a federal judge in Seattle has indefinitely blocked President Trump’s executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship. Historically, US courts have consistently upheld birthright citizenship, making it highly probable that this issue will remain tied up in litigation for an extended period. Any definitive change would require not just executive action but a constitutional amendment or a landmark Supreme Court ruling.“For now, the legal and constitutional precedent supporting birthright citizenship remains strong. However, any change to this principle would necessitate significant legislative and judicial battles, given its far-reaching consequences on immigrant communities and the broader US economy,” Mahajan said.Currently, children born in the United States to immigrant parents—whether on work visas or otherwise—are granted automatic US citizenship, providing a crucial safeguard against the severe green card backlog that disproportionately affects Indian H-1B holders. “This backlog, with decades-long wait times, leaves many high-skilled professionals in an uncertain immigration status for most of their careers. Birthright citizenship has been one of the few stabilising factors for their families,” Mahajan said. She added that the United States’ policy of birthright citizenship has historically set it apart from other developed nations, making it a more attractive destination for global talent.Another issue that could pose challenges for Indian professionals in the US, on H-1B visas, is the move to revoke employment authorisation documents for spouses of H-1B visa holders who are on dependent H-4 visas. “The H-4 EAD was introduced through an executive order by the Barack Obama administration after years of advocacy, providing much-needed relief and economic independence to many spouses of H-1B visa holders. However, under the administration of Trump’s first term, there was a concerted effort to revoke H-4 EADs, creating uncertainty and hardship for thousands of skilled immigrant women. Thanks to relentless advocacy—by organisations like SIIA and many women who chose to raise their voices—the effort to eliminate H-4 EADs was ultimately unsuccessful,” Mahajan said.She added that the broader immigration system has become increasingly difficult to navigate for Indians in the US who are waiting on green card queues. “Even routine H-4 EAD renewals have faced delays, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to employment disruptions and financial instability for many families from India, who already face disproportionately long wait times for permanent residency.”There are also fears now among Indian professionals, on temporary work visas in the US, on reversal of the Joe Biden administration’s order on automatic extension in certain categories of work permits. “These extensions were introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline the renewal process and prevent unnecessary employment disruptions. Any move to revoke automatic work permit extensions would have a significant impact on Indian professionals, particularly those on H-4 EADs,” Mahajan said. The automatic extensions allowed individuals to continue working while their renewal applications were pending, eliminating the need for additional biometrics appointments—a requirement that had been introduced under the earlier Trump administration.“Traditionally, H-1B and H-4 petitions were processed together, ensuring timely approvals. However, if the Trump administration issues new guidance to separate these filings, it could lead to increased delays in work authorisation extensions. This would disproportionately impact H-4 visa holders, many of whom are highly skilled professionals contributing to the US workforce,” Mahajan said.For Indian professionals already navigating decades-long green card wait time, these likely policy changes, being considered by the Trump administration, create additional uncertainty and financial instability.",Several steps being considered by the administration of us president donald trump are cause for worry for thousands of indians in the us.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118013823,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-664928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

President Donald Trump is not interested in sending Prince Harry out of the country, pursuing his visa case because he thinks the ex-royal already has a lot of problems with his wife Meghan Markle. Trump did not like Harry and Meghan's exit from the royal family as Trump's allegiance lies with the late Queen who Trump said liked him.In an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump said he would not pursue the case against Prince Harry.“I don’t want to do that,” he said. “I’ll leave him alone. He’s got enough problems with his wife. She’s terrible.”After stepping down from their royal duties, Harry and Meghan relocated to Los Angeles in 2020. After the release of Harry's memoir 'Spare' released where he admitted to having taken drugs like cocaine, cannabis and psychedelics in the past, questions were raised as to whether he mentioned this in his visa application or if he lied in his visa application because he should have been disqualified from getting a US visa.Heritage Foundation sued the Department of Homeland Security forcing to release Prince Harry's visa records. Harry won the case as the judge ruled that his visa records won't be released but it was apprehended that Donald Trump would pursue the case.Meghan Markle does not like President Trump and the feeling is mutual as Trump also, in pas, spoke negatively about Meghan. In 2022, Trump said he thinks Harry is ""whipped"". ""I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose,"" Trump said at that time.Rumors were rife that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would end their marriage though later it was said that they would choose professional separation instead implying that they would concentrate on their individual work and make rare joint appearances though the California wildfires saw them together visiting relief centers.",Donald trump said he won't deport prince harry as he believed harry already has a lot of problems because of meghan markle.

A Controversy That Won’t Die

Poll Do You Think Politicians Should Speak Out More Against Hate Crimes? No, It’s a Complex Issue Yes, Silence Encourages Hate

JD Vance’s Response: Gaslighting or Genuine Belief?

The Hypocrisy: Why Wasn’t

Ramaswamy Given the Same Grace?

The Big Balls Moment: Musk’s Flippant Justification

When Black NFL players kneeled for the anthem, MAGA figures demanded permanent bans.

When liberal figures were “canceled” for offensive remarks, MAGA called for boycotts and firings.

When an Indian-American MAGA figure was removed, there was silence.

""Christ is King, not some stinky Indian idol.""

""Will there be a cow in the White House soon?""

The Takeaway: Who Gets to Be Forgiven?

Is there any true place for them in MAGA?

Are they only valued as token figures when convenient?

Would their loyalty ever be reciprocated?

The phrase “Normalize Indian Hate” was posted by Marko Elez, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee whose racist social media history resurfaced last week. The revelation sparked a massive backlash, leading to Elez’s resignation. However, Elon Musk, with backing from Vice President JD Vance , reinstated Elez after a public poll on X.Vance’s defense of Elez—despite the blatant racism—has ignited outrage, particularly among Indian-Americans. Critics point to the hypocrisy in how Elez is treated compared to Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-American MAGA figure who was pushed out of DOGE without fanfare or second chances.This controversy highlights a deeper, uncomfortable truth. While MAGA claims to be an inclusive, meritocratic movement, it still harbors deep-seated biases against Indian-Americans—whether they are outsiders criticizing the right or insiders trying to fit in.Vance took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss concerns over Elez’s racist statements. Instead of addressing why he supported the return of someone who publicly advocated hate against Indians , he attacked critics for engaging in “emotional blackmail.”""For the sake of both of our kids? Grow up,"" Vance wrote. ""Racist trolls on the internet, while offensive, don’t threaten my kids. You know what does? A culture that denies grace to people who make mistakes. A culture that encourages Congressmen to act like whiny children.""Vance framed the backlash as part of a cancel culture overreach, ignoring the fact that Elez’s post explicitly targeted Indian-Americans—a group that includes his own wife and children.His dismissive stance infuriated social media users, who called him out for failing to defend his own family.Congressman Ro Khanna responded, saying, ""Are you going to tell him to apologize for saying ‘Normalize Indian hate’ before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids.""Journalist Wajahat Ali added, ""Your wife is Indian American. Your kids are Indian American. Elez said he wants to ‘normalize Indian hate.’ Have some pride, man. Have some dignity. For your family's sake, you pathetic Reek.""Another user, Divya, criticized Vance’s privilege, stating, ""Easy for JD Vance to say this when his kids are covered by 24/7 security. What about regular Indian kids who have been rendered vulnerable because of the normalization of online hatred against Indians?""A well-known activist account, ind_us_immigrnt, pointed out the hypocrisy: ""Say ‘Normalize hate against White people’ and see how the MAGA clowns react.""While Elon Musk and JD Vance rallied to defend Elez, Vivek Ramaswamy—once considered MAGA’s rising star—was swiftly removed from his role in DOGE. Elez gets a poll, a second chance, and full public backing. Ramaswamy gets silence and a quiet exit.This double standard has infuriated Indian-American conservatives, many of whom now feel betrayed by a movement they once supported. The key question remains: Why is a white staffer, who openly promoted racism, given a second chance while an Indian-American leader is pushed aside?Harshil, an Indian-American commentator, pointed out, ""While Vivek Ramaswamy was deselected for DOGE, Elez has the backing of Vance for saying ‘Normalize Indian Hate.’ Indian-Americans, this is straight to your face. No matter how much you succeed, you will always be a second-class citizen.""Musk defended Elez’s return by citing forgiveness, conducting a poll on X in which 78 percent of users voted to reinstate him.Shortly after the results, Musk tweeted, ""He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.""Trump also chimed in, telling reporters, ""I’m with the Vice President.""However, this narrative of forgiveness crumbles when contrasted with MAGA’s past actions.The flippancy of how this issue was handled was best captured by David Sacks, who mocked the situation with this exchange:""Sir, the Pentagon has failed another audit.""""Send in Big Balls.""This level of casual arrogance over racism against Indian-Americans reinforces a harsh truth. Certain groups will always be prioritized within MAGA, while others remain expendable.The ‘Pagan Problem’: MAGA’s Uneasy Relationship With Indian-AmericansIndian-Americans like Usha Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , and Sriram Krishnan have been prominent in MAGA’s political and business circles. Yet, their presence is often met with hostility from MAGA’s nativist and evangelical factions.An e arlier TOI report captured this underlying racism , highlighting online attacks against Usha Vance.Despite these overt attacks, MAGA leaders—including JD Vance himself—have largely ignored or downplayed the bigotry coming from within their own base. The underlying message is clear. Indian-Americans may be allowed in MAGA circles, but they will never be truly embraced.This controversy exposes the inherent contradictions within MAGA’s stance on race, meritocracy, and inclusion. If you are a white conservative who posts racist remarks, you get a poll, a second chance, and the full backing of Trump, Vance, and Musk. If you are an Indian-American conservative, you are disposable. The fallout from Marko Elez’s reinstatement and JD Vance’s dismissive response has left many Indian-Americans wondering:For now, Vance, Musk, and Trump have made their priorities clear. And for Indian-Americans watching from the sidelines, the lesson is stark. MAGA’s loyalty is conditional. And it does not extend to you.","Vice president-elect j.d.

Did Ro Khanna blackmail JD Vance?



President Donald Trump was asked about the controversial exit of Marko Elez from Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency over his past social media posts in one of which he called himself 'racist' and also called for normalizing India hate. Trump said he was not aware of it but if Vice President JD Vance is in favor of rehiring the person, he is with the VP. ""Well I don't know about that particular thing but if the Vice President said so..did you say that? (turning to JD), I'm with the VP,"" Trump said.Marko Elez is a 25-year-old lieutenant of Elon Musk who apparently resigned from DOGE, the Wall Street Journal reported. WSJ reported that Elez made some problematic posts on social media through a pseudonym account which was closed in December probably when he started to work for DOGE but many of those White supremacist posts were archived. WSJ said when they contacted White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt for a comment on Elez's past posts, Leavitt said Elez resigned from DOGE.His past posts included: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.”; “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity. Normalize Indian hate"" etc.Elon Musk ran a poll on X on whether to rehire him and the maximum votes were in favor of rehiring him. Even JD Vance said Elez should not be victimized for his past social media activities which became another major controversy -- as Vance is married to Indian-origin Usha Vance and he did not call out the India hate.JD Vance said he ""obviously"" disagrees with some of Elez's posts but added that he also thinks that past social media activity should not ruin Elez's life. Indian-origin Democrat leader Ro Khanna took offence to Vance's stand and asked him whether Vance would seek an apology from Elez for his ""normalize Indian hate"" statement.

The US state department has formally notified Congress that they are proceeding with more than $8 billion in arms sales to Israel, bypassing an informal review process that had been ongoing in the house foreign affairs committee .The move came just two days after US President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed plans for Gaza’s future.As The New York Times reported, the Pentagon announced on Friday that the arms package includes 3,000 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles worth $660 million, along with bombs and guidance kits valued at $6.75 billion.The sale also includes artillery shells, but the Pentagon did not issue a public statement regarding that portion of the deal.The Biden administration had originally proposed the $8 billion arms package in early January and submitted it for an informal congressional review. While top Republican lawmakers and a Democratic senator approved the sale, Representative Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, held up the process to request additional information.Despite Meeks’ concerns, the State Department proceeded with the sale after it remained under informal review for over 20 days, the standard period for such considerations.Meeks sharply criticized the administration, stating that moving ahead without addressing lawmakers' questions showed a “blatant disregard of long-standing congressional prerogative.”As per the New York Times, he added, “I continue to support Israel’s critical military needs as it faces a range of regional threats,” but argued that the administration failed to provide adequate documentation or justification.Trump has taken a series of steps to bolster Israel’s military capabilities. In late January, he lifted a hold on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, which had been paused under Biden due to concerns over civilian casualties. Trump defended the decision, stating, “because they bought them.”This latest arms transfer is expected to proceed without significant obstacles, as Congress would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate to block the sale, an unlikely scenario given Republican backing.Meanwhile, a separate Israeli request to purchase 5,000 US-made assault rifles remains under congressional review, and additional arms sales could be proposed in the coming weeks.","The us state department has formally notified congress that they are proceeding with more than $8 billion in arms sales to israel. The arms package includes 3,000 hellfire air-to-ground missiles, along with bombs and guidance kits valued at $6.75 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118080905,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1118406,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
