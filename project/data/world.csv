US Lawmakers Name India As Strategic Partner, Dismiss Pakistan As Ally And Flag China As Top Threat

NEW DELHI: Amid questions over Washington’s outreach to Islamabad in recent months, senior US lawmakers moved to clear the air, stressing that India — not Pakistan — remains central to America’s long-term strategic vision in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.Speaking at a discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), representative Rich McCormick underlined India’s importance to global stability.“There is no more important friend that we’re going to need for the future of not just the United States and India, but for the entire stability of the world, than India,” he said, pointing to “the commonality we have in the way we look at economics and freedom and advancement of a people.”McCormick also highlighted the strength of economic ties between the two countries. “Pakistan is a country with 300 million people. But you don't see it bringing investments into America. India not only take investment, it also brings investments into the United States,” he said.Stressing the broader importance of the relationship, McCormick warned, “If America embraces Indians as friends, we will have peace and prosperity.If we alienate them, it is going to be big trouble for all of us.”His remarks come amid strains in bilateral ties following the Trump administration’s decision to impose steep 50% tariffs over India’s purchase of Russian oil. Relations have also faced friction over issues such as US immigration policy and President Donald Trump’s claim of having ended the India–Pakistan conflict in May last year.Representative Ami Bera echoed the message, saying routine diplomatic engagement with Pakistan should not be mistaken for a strategic shift. “We’re not creating a strategic partnership with Pakistan,” Bera said.“You don’t see American companies making multibillion-dollar investments in Pakistan. That’s all happening in India,” he said, adding that investors clearly understand US priorities.While noting that India follows an independent foreign policy, McCormick said Washington understands New Delhi’s decisions. Calling PM Narendra Modi “extremely nationalistic,” he said, “PM Modi is extremely nationalistic in a good way. He's looking out for his country. When India buys cheap Russian oil, America hates that. But he is doing it in the best interest of his country.”The renewed emphasis on the partnership comes as Washington and New Delhi work to finalise a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor has said the two sides are actively engaged in concluding a new deal.","Republican representative rich mccormick underlined india’s importance to global stability.

NEW DELHI: The Indian government has defended its decision to not participate in the ""Brics Naval Exercise"", saying it was purely a South African initiative in which not all Brics members took part.The naval exercise was not a regular or institutionalised Brics activity, said the ministry of external affairs.""India has not participated in previous such activities.

NEW DELHI: India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with Iran seeking consular access and early resolution for the case of 16 Indian crew members on board a merchant vessel detained by Iranian authorities in December last year, the Indian embassy in Tehran said.In a press release on Saturday, the embassy said it was informed around mid-December 2025 about the detention of MT Valiant Roar. The Consulate of India in Bandar Abbas wrote to the Iranian government on December 14 seeking consular access to the crew and has since followed up through diplomatic correspondence and in-person meetings in Bandar Abbas and Tehran, including at the level of the ambassador.“The Iranian authorities were also requested to allow the crew to communicate with their families in India,” the embassy said.The mission said it contacted the UAE-based ship-owning company on December 15 and has remained in touch with its Iran-based agents to ensure food, water and fuel supplies for the vessel, besides pressing for legal representation for the crew in Iranian courts. After being informed of depleting provisions, the mission intervened with the Iranian navy, which arranged emergency food and water supplies in early January.The Indian consulate in Dubai has also been engaging the ship-owning company to ensure regular provisioning and legal support, the embassy said, adding that the case is expected to go through Iran’s judicial process.“However, the Mission and the Consulate continue to press the Iranian authorities to grant early consular access to the crew, and to ensure expeditious completion of the judicial proceedings,” the statement said.Earlier in the day, the father of one of the detained crew members appealed to Indian authorities for urgent intervention. Mukesh Mehta said his son Ketan, a third engineer on board the tanker operated by Prime Tanker LLC, Dubai, was among those detained after the vessel was intercepted at Bandar Abbas port, reported PTI.He said the family has been living in constant anxiety since learning of the detention and appealed to the government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ministry of external affairs and the Directorate General of Shipping to take immediate diplomatic steps to secure the crew’s release.Iran on December 13 had seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman, claiming it was carrying six million litres of diesel fuel and had 16 crew members from India on board.Iran has frequently announced the boarding of vessels it accuses of illegally transporting fuel, citing smuggling concerns amid low domestic fuel prices. Authorities have denied that such seizures are retaliatory actions against other countries.The Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz remain critical maritime chokepoints, handling nearly 20 per cent of global oil trade, with heightened tensions continuing amid increased regional naval activity and geopolitical friction.","India has stepped up diplomatic engagement with iran seeking consular access and early resolution. 16 indian crew members on board a merchant vessel detained by iranian authorities in december last year.

Why SC says Pocso needs 'Romeo-Juliet' clause,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-sc-says-pocso-needs-romeo-juliet-clause/articleshow/126628694.cms,"AI image

Text and inputs: Rajesh Sharma, Ambika Pandit

A two-judge bench of Supreme Court on Jan 9 pointed to the repeated misuse of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( Pocso ) Act - introduced in 2012 to shield minors from sexual abuse - saying it was increasingly being used to criminalise consensual teenage relationships or to settle personal scores.Hearing a matter related to an Allahabad high court order in a sexual assault case, justices Sanjay Karol and N Kotiswar Singh highlighted how a law designed to protect children can turn into a blunt instrument, threatening to harm those it was meant to safeguard while also eroding public faith in the justice system.The SC bench asked Centre to consider introducing a 'Romeo-Juliet' clause to exempt ""genuine adolescent relationships"" from Pocso's harshest provisions. The court called for a legal carve-out for consensual close-in-age relationships and action against those who misuse the law to ""settle scores"".At the same time, the bench was careful that the moral and legal force of Pocso Act be kept intact. It said the Act was ""the most solemn articulations of justice aimed at protecting the children of today and the leaders of tomorrow"", underlining that the problem lay not with the law's intent but in how it was being applied on the ground.The top court's apprehensions are well-founded, with experts pointing to lasting impacts caused by the misapplication of the law.""In one case we worked with, a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were in a consensual relationship. While the boy's family opposed it, the girl's family eventually accepted the couple. Due to mandatory reporting, the boy spent several months in an observation home. After his release, the couple went on to live together with the girl's family and are now raising a two-year-old child. However, the impact of the case continues - their son is still struggling to get school admission due to complications in documentation,"" said Sachi Maniar, director of Mumbai-based Ashiyana Foundation, which works with children in the juvenile justice system.""Many cases under Pocso Act involve consensual adolescent relationships. Despite this, it is usually the boys who are sent to observation homes. Many ask, 'Is it wrong to fall in love?', 'Why am I being punished?' and carry a deep sense of betrayal, injustice, and trauma from being institutionalised. Some even say they will never trust relationships again or feel they must avoid girls altogether,"" adds Maniar.The bench went beyond procedural law to address what it described as a deeper crisis around the misuse of Pocso. Quoting earlier judgments, it warned that when a law of ""noble"" intent is twisted into a tool of vendetta, ""the notion of justice itself teeters on the edge of inversion"".The court pointed to two sharply unequal realities. On one side are children who are silenced by fear, stigma or poverty, making justice distant and uncertain. On the other are those ""equipped with privilege, literacy, social and monetary capital"", who can manipulate the law to their advantage. It is this imbalance that has led to consensual adolescent relationships being reframed as criminal offences with family or social disputes getting dragged into court.The judges also reminded lawyers of their ethical duty to act as gatekeepers against frivolous or vindictive litigation, warning that unchecked misuse of powerful criminal laws corrodes public confidence in justice.The 'Romeo-Juliet' clause proposed by Supreme Court is not a new or radical idea. Many countries have brought in close-in-age exemptions to prevent teenagers in consensual relationships from being prosecuted under statutory rape laws simply because one partner is technically a minor.In the US, for instance, at least 43 states have some form of such protection, effectively decriminalising sex between teenagers of a similar age. Canada allows sexual relations between 14- and 15-year-olds and a partner that's older by no more than five years, with a tighter two-year exemption for 12- and 13-year-olds. These provisions are designed to recognise adolescent relationships without opening the door to exploitation.Typically, such laws protect the older partner from arrest if the age difference is within a defined limit and the relationship is consensual. Non-consensual acts remain fully criminal, ensuring that predators cannot hide behind the exemption.However, experts warn that age gaps alone cannot capture the complexity of adolescent consent. As research has noted, focusing only on age ""may mask realities of how informed an adolescent's consent truly was"", making it essential that a minor's testimony and the surrounding circumstances remain central to any legal assessment.Recent reforms, such as in the Philippines, show a global trend towards raising the age of consent while still recognising the reality of teenage relationships.By calling for a Romeo-Juliet clause, Supreme Court is signalling that India's child protection framework needs a more nuanced middle ground - one that distinguishes between abuse and adolescent intimacy, and between predation and peer relationships.If Parliament acts on the court's suggestion, it could prevent thousands of young couples from being dragged into the criminal justice system, while also freeing police and courts to focus on genuine cases of sexual violence against children. At the same time, safeguards would be needed to ensure that such an exemption is not misused to shield coercion or exploitation. For a law as powerful and sensitive as Pocso, Supreme Court's message is clear - protect children fiercely, but do not let the law become a weapon against them.But Anant Kumar Asthana, an advocate who practices child justice and criminal law in Delhi, argues that a Romeo-Juliet clause may not be a ready solution.""The idea of introducing close-in-age exception (Romeo-Juliet clause) in Pocso regime does not fundamentally advance the cause of decriminalisation of consensual or genuine adolescent sexual relations. Instead, it binds judges to one more rigid and mandatory formula that can only be applied in a regulated manner and in a specific set of facts and figures,"" he said.""In a law like Pocso, the chasm between access and abuse can be best navigated in a just and compassionate manner by a trial judiciary that is empowered with widest possible judicial discretion in matters of arrest, bail, trial and sentencing,"" he added. ""Invoking Romeo-Juliet exception can be one of the options that can be legislatively or judicially made available to Pocso judges, but it becomes a problem when this option is put as the only option for exercising judicial discretion. ""","Supreme court asked centre to consider introducing a 'romeo-juliet' clause to exempt ""genuine adolescent relationships"" from pocso's harshest provisions. The court called for a legal carve-out for consensual close-in-age relationships and action against those who misuse the law.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126628802,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-589609,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States completes the top ten with connectivity to 179 destinations. Although still formidable, its passport has experienced a modest decline in recent years. Visa policy and reciprocity influence the landscape, positioning it slightly below several comparable nations in terms of global mobility.","Henley passport index 2026 reveals world's most powerful passports.

Navid Afkari’s execution after protests shows the deadly cost of dissent in Iran

Navid Afkari dreamed of wearing Iran’s colors at the Olympics. Donald Trump tried to save his life and Dana White begged publicly for mercy. Still, in September 2020, the Iranian state hanged the 27-year-old wrestler. His death shocked the sports world and sent fear through a nation already hurting.If life had been fair, Afkari would have been training, traveling, and chasing medals. Instead, he was killed by the same country he loved after joining street protests. Iranian officials said he was guilty of murder. Afkari said again and again he was innocent. Human rights groups said his trial was unfair. What happened next showed how dangerous it can be to speak up in Iran.Afkari grew up in Shiraz, a city known for poetry and culture. Wrestling is Iran’s proudest sport, and Afkari was good at it from a young age. By 17, he was in a national camp. By 23, coaches saw him as a future Olympian. To support his training, he worked as a laborer during the day and trained whenever he could. His rise made him famous, and that fame later made him a target.In 2018, Iran faced large protests over rising prices and strict rules.Afkari joined those protests. Soon after, he and his two brothers were arrested and accused of killing a security guard. Afkari said he was tortured into a false confession. Amnesty International called his trial “grossly unfair,” saying he was not allowed a proper defense.Despite global anger, the courts sentenced Afkari to death. One charge was murder. Another was “waging war against the state” for protesting. His brothers received long prison terms, with one spending around 1,000 days in solitary confinement. Afkari’s claims of torture were never properly checked.On September 12, 2020, Afkari was hanged in Shiraz. His family was not allowed a final visit. The execution was rushed. United Nations later said the killing appeared to be used as a warning during growing unrest.Before his death, Afkari recorded a message from prison. He said he had faced many opponents in wrestling, but none as unfair as the system holding him. He said he was innocent and asked people not to forget him.Iran’s power system leaves little room for protest. The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has final control. Online spaces are tightly watched, and many platforms are blocked. Journalist Masih Alinejad later said Afkari became a hero after death, not because he wanted fame, but because he spoke up.Trump and White both appealed publicly. Trump posted on Twitter asking Iran to spare Afkari’s life, linking to Fox News. White released a video saying Afkari was a human being and deserved mercy. Their efforts failed.After Afkari’s death, his grave was damaged many times. According to Iran International, officials even tried to control his headstone to stop it becoming a protest site. Years later, fear still surrounds those who speak out. Afkari’s story shows how little has changed, and how high the price of protest remains.Also Read: Olympic Swimmer Ryan Lochte Moves In With Girlfriend And Her Three Kids As Blended Family Grows Amid Divorce And Custody Battle",Iran hanged wrestler navid afkari at 27 after protests ignoring pleas from donald trump and dana white.

Allen Iverson’s ultimate financial safety net

The divorce settlement bifurcated Iverson’s trust fund



What is Allen Iverson doing now?



In the high-stakes world of NBA contracts, there are flashy max deals, and then there is the absolute masterclass in foresight known as the Allen Iverson Life Line. While he was busy breaking ankles and redefining league culture in the early 2000s, Allen Iverson’s team was quietly securing a financial legacy that would outlast his playing years by decades.It is one of the most legendary financial savings stories in sports history, and as Iverson, but as he inches closer to his mid-50s, it turns out he’s about to execute the greatest fast-break in the history of sports business: a $32 million trust fund courtesy of Reebok.Back in 2001, when Iverson was at his peak with the 2000-01 MVP award, he wrote history as the shortest player (6’0”) ever to win it. The same year, he also signed the ultimate financial safety net with Reebok. Taking into consideration his reputation as a lavish spender, Iverson’s agent and Reebok structured this unique lifetime contract that would support him in his post-league life.The deal included a yearly stipend in which Reebok will pay Iverson $800,000 every year for life. A lump sum trust fund of $32 million was set aside, but Iverson couldn’t touch it until he turned 55 years old. This year, on June 7th, Iverson will turn 51, and after 4 more years, in 2030, he can finally access this money.In a game of fate, Iverson lost his entire trust fund to his wife, Tawana Turner, after violating their postnuptial agreement. But Turner, instead of taking the entire check, decided to leave 50% with Iverson that saved him from financial ruin. When the fund finally matures in 2030, Iverson will likely walk away with $16 million, while the other $16 million goes to his ex-wife.Iverson’s career and life have given him some hard lessons about money. When his financial struggles hit the headlines, the world was shocked because this was the man who once ruled the NBA.In an interview in 2025, AI sat down and talked about how popularity and money had people circling him at one point, but with depleting finances, the circle became smaller and smaller.He said, “Just because you love somebody don't mean they love you the same way,"" he said. ""I made so many mistakes trusting people that you think supposed to love you. I'm not talking about friends that you grew up with … I'm talking about even family. Money is really the root of all evil.""In late 2023, Allen Iverson was appointed as the vice president of basketball in Reebok with Shaquille O’Neal as its president. This move wasn't just ceremonial, it brought Iverson back into the fold to help relaunch the brand's basketball category for the 2025-2026 season. He also published a memoir in 2025, Misunderstood, that dived deep into his upbringing, childhood, basketball, and becoming a cultural icon.Also read: The 21-year old Anthony Black announced himself to Europe with a poster dunk in Berlin","Allen iverson has a $32 million trust fund courtesy of reebok.

xAI and Grok are ‘public nuisance’





Ashley St Clair, American writer and mother of Elon Musk’s son Romulus has sued the tech billionaire’s AI company xAI. In the lawsuit filed with the supreme court of the state of New York, Clair alleges that her explicit images were generated by AI chatbot Grok, including one in which she was underage. She further claims that the AI tool, integrated into X (formerly Twitter) – also owned by Elon Musk – promised to stop generating explicit images but continued to do so. Clair is seeking both punitive and compensatory damages from the company.The lawsuit comes days after the tech billionaire said that he will seek full custody of his one-year-old son with Clair. Responding to a user urging him for full custody, Musk wrote on X “I will be filing for full custody today, given her statements implying she might transition a one-year-old boy.”The lawsuit states that the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.The filing further alleges that not only were the generated images nonconsensual, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Ashley St Clair is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer. In a statement to the Guardian, Goldberg said:“xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them on X.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm. We intend to hold Grok accountable and to help establish clear legal boundaries for the entire public’s benefit to prevent AI from being weaponised for abuse.”",Ashley st clair is the mother of elon musk's one-year-old son romulus.

Record spending planned as global health indicators worsen

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Bill Gates and his former -wife are among the top donators to the foundation. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion to the endowment through 2024. Warren Buffett, who is a former trustee and a clsowe friend of Gates donated $43.3 billion from 2006 to 2024.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget.To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year. That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Bill Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030 as global health indicators worsen.

$1 billion entry fee?

US President Donald Trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the US and retain a seat on his proposed “peace board”, or as many critics claimed as an ""alternative to the United Nations,"" Bloomberg reported, citing a draft charter.According to the draft, Trump would serve as the inaugural chairman, with each member state granted a term of no more than three years from the charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal at the chairman’s discretion.The draft also says that Trump would decide who is invited as members. Decisions would be made by a majority, with each member state getting one vote, but all decisions would still require the chairman’s approval.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force,” the draft says.Some critics worry that Trump may be trying to create an alternative to the United Nations, which he has long criticised.The board is described in the draft as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.” It would become official once three member states agree to the charter.However, the White House called the report “misleading” and said there is no minimum membership fee to join the Board of Peace.“This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity,” the White House said on X.The US state department, when asked by Reuters, referred to previous social media posts about the board by Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, which did not mention the $1 billion figure.","Us president donald trump wants nations to pay a king’s ransom of $1 billion to remain in harmony with the us.

Forrest “KreekCraft” Barnes says TikTok AI wrongly flagged his age, fans and creators react online







Forrest “KreekCraft” Barnes, one of the most well-known Roblox streamers, shocked his fans when he shared that TikTok had banned his account again. The ban happened on January 16, 2026, and it came at a time when KreekCraft was still active and posting regularly. The reason, according to him, was not rule breaking or bad content. Instead, TikTok’s AI system believed he was under 18 years old.KreekCraft shared the news himself on X, where he posted that TikTok’s automated age system had made a mistake. He explained that he is almost 29 years old and nowhere close to being underage. Many fans were quick to react, as this was not the first time the creator faced the same problem. The incident once again raised questions about how TikTok’s AI moderation works and how often real people review these decisions.According to KreekCraft, the ban also stopped him from going live on the platform, which is a key part of his content. TikTok’s message clearly stated that creators must be 18 or older to use LIVE features, and his access would only return years later unless fixed.KreekCraft explained his side clearly in his X post. He wrote,“TikTok just banned me again because their AI thinks I’m under 18 years old. I turn 29 in two weeks.AI age verification is a joke.”He also shared a screenshot from TikTok that read,“From 2022-11-13, creators must be 18 or older to go LIVE. The Virtual Items Policy and Community Guidelines will also be updated accordingly. LIVE access suspended. You can go LIVE and join a LIVE as a guest starting from January 15, 2031 18:59.”The post quickly gained attention, with more than 280 users replying. One user, @JeseMartinez, said,“I got banned because I promoted my business on a TikTok business account. They are a joke.”Another user, @SadCustomers, shared their frustration and wrote,“Yep, another awful AI-led process with almost no human intervention. They banned me for posting satirical content even though it wasn’t against their own terms and conditions.”This is not the first time KreekCraft faced this issue. On October 13, 2025, he posted a YouTube Shorts video explaining that TikTok ended his livestream while he was playing Roblox. He said,“So, I got banned on TikTok, and you’re never going to guess why. The TikTok AI thought I was a kid. I’m 28 years old. This is actually the second time it’s happened.”KreekCraft remains one of the biggest Roblox creators, with over 311,000 followers on Twitch and more than 16.1 million subscribers on YouTube.","Forrest “kreekcraft” barnes, one of the most well-known roblox streamers, shocked his fans when he shared that tiktok had banned his account again.

Trump's Brutal ISIS Revenge: US Military Air-drops 90 Bombs On Arab Nation After Venezuela





Syrian government forces moved into Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria on Saturday, taking several towns and triggering clashes that have shaken a tentative political arrangement aimed at restoring central control over the country.This follows weeks of tension and heavy fighting earlier this month between government troops and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led group backed by the United States. Syria’s army said it had taken control of the Tabqa military airport in Raqqa province, which had previously been held by Kurdish forces, as reported by AFP.Raqqa became a global symbol of the war after the Islamic State group captured it in 2014 and declared it the capital of its self-styled caliphate. The city was badly damaged during the US-led campaign that defeated the group and has since remained under SDF control, with a small US military presence nearby.Since Bashar Assad was removed from power last year, Kurdish authorities have been reluctant to place their forces under the new government’s command. Talks on integrating Kurdish military and civilian bodies into the post-war Syrian state have continued for months but have recently stalled.The renewed fighting has increased concern in Washington, where officials fear a wider conflict between Damascus and Kurdish forces could undermine efforts to prevent an Islamic State comeback and put US troops in Syria at risk.The government advance came hours after SDF fighters withdrew from positions east of Aleppo. The pullback followed a decree issued on Friday by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa affirming the rights of Kurdish Syrians, a move seen as an attempt to ease tensions after government strikes in the area.However, the calm was short-lived. Both sides accused each other of breaking the understanding, and clashes quickly spread.US officials urged restraint as violence escalated. The head of US forces in the Middle East, Adm. Brad Cooper, called on Syrian government troops to “cease any offensive actions” near Aleppo. Separately, US special envoy Thomas J. Barrack Jr. met Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq as Washington sought to prevent a broader confrontation.Fighting was reported in multiple towns and villages as government forces said they were advancing through oil-rich areas toward the strategic town of Tabqa, which lies about 30 miles from Raqqa.At least 24 civilians have been killed in five days of fighting, with thousands forced to flee. The clashes mark some of the deadliest violence since Syria’s civil war ended in December 2024, when al-Sharaa’s rebel coalition overthrew the Assad regime.","Syrian government forces moved into kurdish-held areas of northern syria on saturday, taking several towns and triggering clashes.

‘Escaped Somalia To Be Killed In US?’: Ilhan Omar TRASHES Trump In Fiery ‘ICE Kidnapping’ Hearing





A US federal judge on Friday barred immigration officers in Minnesota from detaining or using force against peaceful protesters.The ruling comes amid rising tensions between federal agents and demonstrators over a large federal immigration enforcement operation in the Minneapolis area, reported AP.In an 83-page order issued on Friday, US District Judge Katherine Menendez restricted how federal immigration agents may interact with protesters, barring them from arresting or detaining individuals engaged in “peaceful and unobstructive protest activity” or from retaliating against protected speech through the use of tear gas, pepper spray, or other crowd-dispersal tools.Judge Menendez ruled that officers may not arrest individuals without probable cause or reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or that officers are being obstructed. She also barred agents from stopping vehicles when there is no reasonable suspicion, noting that “safely following agents at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion,” AP reported.The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed in December on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The case alleges that federal agents violated protesters’ constitutional rights during immigration enforcement actions.The order gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 72 hours to bring its immigration operation in the Minneapolis–St Paul area into compliance.The order follows a series of violent encounters involving federal agents this month. On January 7, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old American woman Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement action, officials said the officer fired after Good’s vehicle approached him, though video evidence and local accounts have raised questions about the circumstances of the encounter.Later this week, on January 14, a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during a targeted traffic stop in North Minneapolis. DHS said the man, identified as a Venezuelan national, fled and then engaged in a struggle with officers before the shot was fired, and he was hospitalised and is expected to recover.In a separate incident, DHS confirmed that Heber Sanchez Dominguez, a 34-year-old Mexican national, died while in ICE custody, bringing the number of deaths in ICE detention so far this year to at least four.The Justice Department is investigating Walz and Frey for allegedly impeding federal officers, CBS News reported, a move that could further inflame tensions. The department did not respond to requests for comment. Responding to the ruling, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency was taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters,” AP reported, adding that obstructing or assaulting law enforcement remained a serious crime.Protests intensified after Good’s killing, with crowds clashing with immigration officers and counter-protesters. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of carrying out “a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota,” in a video posted on X, AFP said. Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for peaceful protests against immigration sweeps.US President Donald Trump, who earlier threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the military, said on Friday that there was no immediate need to do so. “If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” he told reporters at the White House, according to AFP.BBC notes that the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law, allows a US president to deploy active-duty military forces to carry out law-enforcement duties within the United States.
