India backs EU’s quest for just peace in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-backs-eus-quest-for-just-peace-in-ukraine/articleshow/118637170.cms,"PM Narendra Modi with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen

PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support – in a leaders’ statement after their meeting Friday – for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that’s based on respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.The leaders also reiterated their commitment to the “vision of the two-State solution” with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, consistent with international law. This is the first time India has reiterated its support for the two-state solution at the highest level since President Donald Trump announced his plan to overtake Gaza.The solidarity with the EU on Ukraine is particularly significant in the context of what happened in the UN this week when EU States led by France managed to water down the US “forward looking resolution” on Ukraine in the General Assembly that called for lasting, but not just and comprehensive, peace and a swift end to the conflict. The language used in the India-EU leaders’ statement is similar to one of the 3 amendments that France introduced in that resolution - just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine that respects the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The amendments meant that the US had to abstain from voting on its own resolution in the General Assembly, although it was later adopted in the Security Council in its original form, with 10 votes in favour. The UK, France and the remaining members – Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.Interestingly, neither leader explicitly mentioned the Ukraine issue in their media statements that followed their bilateral meeting. While describing India as a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, von der Leyen only said that authoritarian states are getting bolder, ignoring borders and threatening peace at sea.However, at a public event earlier in the day, she lashed out at Russia for trying to tear Ukraine apart and said what the EU seeks is for any peace talk to lead to “just and lasting” peace. Playing on India’s concerns about China’s expansionism, the EU leader said a failed Ukraine would not just weaken Europe but also ""intensify"" challenges in other parts of the world. “Not least in this region. Other countries around the world are watching very closely whether there is any impunity if you invade a neighbour or violate international borders. Or whether there are real deterrents,’’ said von der Leyen, adding peace, security and prosperity are indivisible in this world.The landmark EU visit, which saw von der Leyen accompanied by the College of Commissioners for the first time, had been in the works for almost 6 months but happened finally at a time its transatlantic alliance is threatening to unravel because of Trump’s policies. The president said wars, conflicts and coups have erupted in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in Africa and across different regions, adding what happens in one part of the world matters to both Europe and India.“With a free and prosperous Ukraine, that can join the European family. And Europe is ready to live up to its responsibility when it comes to security and defence. We will step up our defence spending to ensure that Member States have access to the full spectrum of capabilities that this new reality demands,’’ she added, talking about historic steps to protect Ukraine and its future.",Pm narendra modi joined eu leader ursula von der leyen in expressing support for a just and lasting peace in ukraine.

She identified trade, technology and connectivity as other areas for taking India-EU ties to the next level, saying the relationship can become one of the defining partnerships of the century.Without specifically talking about US President Donald Trump or his trigger-happy treatment of allies, she also said both India and the EU stood to lose from a world of spheres of influence and isolationism, and gained from a world of cooperation and working together. ""Because we can offer each other distinctive alternatives and tools to make ourselves stronger, more secure and more sovereign in today's world. The kind of offer that cannot really be replicated by others,"" she said.On a new security and defence partnership with India, von der Leyen said this would help both sides step up work to counter common threats whether on cross-border terrorism , maritime security threats, cyber attacks or the new phenomenon: attacks on critical infrastructure.""There is a lot that we can build on. For instance, the recent collaboration on maritime security. And I am delighted at India's interest in joining defence industrial projects under the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation. India is working hard to diversify its military supply and to access new capabilities. And I believe we can help each other to deliver on our security objectives,"" she said.Talking about the geopolitical and geoeconomic headwinds that both EU and India are confronted with, von der Leyen said the world had reached another inflection point. She said this was not a time to place limits on India-EU cooperation. ""Or to get stuck looking for agreement on every issue of regional or global concern. It is time to be pragmatic and ambitious. And to realign our priorities for today's realities,"" she said.Describing IMEEC as a potential modern golden road, von der Leyen said it could make trade between India and Europe 40% faster. ""It is a green and digital bridge across continents and civilisations. This can be a win-win-win for Europe, India and our partners. We are ready to invest in concrete projects that can already start making these connections happen,"" she said.""Make in India and 'made in Europe' can work together to drive our industries forward.

Von der Leyen expressed her commitment to finalizing this agreement in 2025, which would significantly boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation.Additionally, discussions centered on enhancing strategic alignment, including a proposed security and defense partnership aimed at countering common threats such as cross-border terrorism and cyber-attacks.""We must take our trade and technology council to the next level...

Sanjay Bhandari wins appeal against extradition to India over risk of mistreatment at Tihar jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanjay-bhandari-wins-appeal-against-extradition-to-india-over-risk-of-mistreatment-at-tihar-jail/articleshow/118637201.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: Defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to India from London on the grounds that he would be at real risk of extortion, torture or violence in Tihar jail and at risk of a flagrant denial of justice at trial.Bhandari had appealed the Nov 7, 2022 decision of district judge Snow at Westminster magistrates’ court to allow his extradition to India on six grounds. A hearing took place in Dec 2024, and on Friday high court judges Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn handed down judgment allowing his appeal on two of those grounds, namely that his extradition would be a breach of article 3 (torture or inhuman treatment) and a breach of article 6 (the right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), making it unlawful. They discharged him.The Indian govt has 14 days in which it can apply to get a point of law of general public importance certified by the high court and then apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. But this is rarely granted.Delhi was seeking to extradite Bhandari to face two charges: wilfully evading taxes by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income amounting to Rs 665 crore on his Indian tax return and money laundering.His undisclosed foreign assets include 19 foreign bank accounts, six companies and four properties in London and Dubai, the charges state.The judges dismissed an assurance from the Indian govt that Bhandari would only be interrogated in Tihar jail, saying that Bhandari would “ be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials. The nature of the allegations against him, and the publicity in relation to them in India, are such that he would be perceived to be a very rich man and therefore a prime target for extortion. In view of the extreme overcrowding and very significant level of understaffing in Tihar prison, it would be very difficult for even the most conscientious of prison officials to protect him from extortion and mistreatment at the hands of other prisoners, including gang members. Add to that the compelling evidence that incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly, it is clear that he would face a real risk of proscribed treatment.”They pointed out that Tillu Tajpuriya was murdered by other prisoners in Tihar jail on May 2, 2023, and Ankit Gujjar was killed on the night of August 3-4, 2021 allegedly by top jail officials.“The evidence is that the use of proscribed treatment to obtain confessions is commonplace and endemic,” the judges wrote. They blamed this on the “lack of will to stamp out the use of torture, reflected in the failure to ratify the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.”They also cited torture allegations made by British citizens Jagtar Singh Johal and Christian Michel. “It is apparent that the acceptance in India of torture or other serious mistreatment as a method of evidence-gathering extends beyond the police and investigating bodies, such that it is unlikely that Bhandari could look to prison officials for protection from the organisations that are engaged in investigating him,” they said.Because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, they said this was a flagrant denial of his rights under article 6, as it “fundamentally destroys the fairness of the prospective trial”.","Defence middleman sanjay bhandari has won his appeal against extradition to india from london.

Pope Francis, currently hospitalised with pneumonia, suffered a breathing crisis on Friday, causing him to vomit,. However, he was quickly administered oxygen and responded well to treatment, according to AFP report.The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been receiving treatment at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital for the past two weeks, experienced a bronchospasm episode that led to a sudden respiratory decline.""The Holy Father promptly underwent broncho-aspiration and began non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with a good response on gas exchange,"" the Vatican said in a statement.Despite the setback, Francis remained alert and cooperative throughout the ordeal, and doctors are closely monitoring his condition over the next 24 to 48 hours to assess any further deterioration, a Vatican source said.Pope’s condition remains serious but stableEarlier on Friday, Vatican insiders had suggested that Francis' condition was no longer critical, following gradual improvements. However, his medical team remains cautious, keeping his health status “reserved”, meaning no predictions can be made about his recovery.The pontiff, who had part of his lung removed as a young man, is prone to respiratory infections and has battled chronic bronchitis in recent years. His age and pre-existing respiratory condition mean that full recovery could take time, doctors warn.Despite his health struggles, Francis continues to work from his hospital suite, engaging in breathing exercises, resting, and praying.Resignation speculation growsThis fourth hospitalisation in his 12-year papacy—the longest so far—has reignited speculation about whether Francis might step down. With his packed schedule leading up to the Jubilee year celebrations, Vatican expert Marco Politi suggested that if the pope recovers, he may complete the Jubilee year but could then reconsider his position.Francis has previously stated that he is open to resigning, following in the footsteps of Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 due to health concerns. However, before his hospitalization, he repeatedly affirmed that he was not yet ready to retire—and may never be.For now, the focus remains on the pope’s recovery, as the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics await further updates on his health.","Pope francis, currently hospitalised with pneumonia, suffered a breathing crisis on friday.

After years of negotiations for an India-EU free trade agreement (FTA), PM Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finally set a deadline - end of this year - for a balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement, in a significant takeaway from the EU leader’s visit.Describing India-EU partnership as natural and organic - one that’s based on trust and shared democratic values - Modi announced both leaders asked their teams to finalise by the year end what would be, according to von der Leyen, the largest deal of its kind in the world. The leaders asked the officials to work as trusted partners to enhance market access and remove trade barriers, according to a joint statement.India and the EU will hold the 10th round of FTA negotiations in March since the talks were relaunched in 2021. Agreeing that meeting the deadline won’t be easy, von der Leyen said timing and determination matters. EU officials reiterated after the meeting that they will continue to seek reduction of tariffs by India on wines and cars, without which the agreement won’t be possible, but said that commitment matters at the political level.Modi also said that to strengthen the investment framework, the leaders discussed progress on the ongoing discussions for an Investment Protection and GI (Geographical Indications) Agreement this year. They agreed to take concrete steps to carry forward the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor initiative, with Modi saying it will drive global commerce, sustainable growth and prosperity in the future.While there was talk about enhancing cooperation in AI, semiconductors and space, both leaders also focused on peace and security in the Indo-Pacific, agreeing to work for inclusive development in third countries in the region. In a joint statement, they reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free, open, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific built on international law and mutual respect for sovereignty. Modi welcomed the EU joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).In her media statement, the president also said that her visit was taking place at a time the 7 planets in the solar system had come into perfect alignment. “They say this signals transformation and growth. The planets are aligned – and so are Europe and India,’’ she said.The joint statement said that the leaders expressed satisfaction at growing cooperation in the defence and security domain, including joint exercises and collaboration between Indian Navy and EU Maritime security entities. The EU side also welcomed India’s interest in joining projects under the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and in negotiating a Security of Information Agreement (SoIA). Citing threats from authoritarian states, von der Leyen said that now is the time to step up security and defence cooperation on land, at sea and in space and have more joint exercises in the Indian Ocean.The leaders also committed to exploring a formal security and defence partnership. “They reiterated their commitment to international peace and security, including maritime security by tackling traditional and non-traditional threats to safeguard trade & sea lanes of communication,’’ said the statement.Modi said that the leaders have prepared a blueprint for collaboration in the areas of trade, technology, investment, innovation, green growth, security, skilling and mobility.“Our growing cooperation on issues related to Defence and Security, is a symbol of our mutual trust. We will take forward our cooperation on Cyber Security, Maritime Security and Counter Terrorism,’’ said the PM, adding a bold and ambitious roadmap will be launched at the India-EU summit later this year.

If Isaiah Bond runs a 4.1, the NFL world has a decision to make

Isaiah Bond isn’t guessing. He’s certain. The Texas wide receiver is stepping onto the turf at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday, fully expecting to walk away as the fastest player in NFL Scouting Combine history.Bond told reporters on Friday.That’s not just confidence. That’s a straight-up declaration. And considering Bond has already clocked a 4.23 before, it’s not empty talk. He’s not hoping—he’s expecting.Xavier Worthy barely had time to celebrate his record before Bond set his sights on it. Last year, Worthy—also a Texas wide receiver—shattered John Ross’ 4.22-second record with a 4.21 at the combine. A blink, a step, and history changed.Now? Bond is calling for a 4.20. Maybe even a 4.1.he said via Clarence Hill Jr. of All City DLLS.If he actually does it, he’s not just breaking a record—he’s redefining what’s possible. A 4.1 at the combine would be absurd. No one has ever done it, and frankly, most don’t believe it’s possible. But Bond does.Speed kills in the NFL. A record-breaking 40-yard dash could send Bond’s draft stock skyrocketing, even if he’s not currently projected as a top pick. If a 4.1 flashes on that timer, scouts and GMs are going to be scrambling.Fast receivers have gotten over-drafted before (hi, John Ross). But Bond isn’t just banking on speed. He’s betting on himself, knowing that if he backs up his talk, teams won’t be able to ignore him.It all comes down to Saturday. If Bond runs a 4.20? That’s history. If he runs a 4.1? That’s a different conversation. The kind that gets people paid.","Texas wide receiver isaiah bond wants to break the record for the fastest 40-yard dash.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday returned boxes of documents taken from US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate during a 2022 search.The materials, some marked classified, were key evidence in a criminal case accusing Trump of illegally taking government files and blocking their return. However, the charges were dismissed after a judge ruled against them last year.Prosecutors later dropped their appeal following Trump’s re-election in November, citing Justice Department rules against charging a sitting president, reports The New York Times.Trump had long argued that he had the right to keep the documents. After the case was dismissed, he and his team pushed for their return. The White House announced on Friday that the FBI had given back the seized materials.Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, called the 2022 search “unlawful and illegal” and confirmed that the boxes were being loaded onto Air Force One before the president's departure for Mar-a-Lago on Friday evening. Trump’s counselor, Alina Habba, said the materials included personal belongings of Trump and his family.In a statement, Trump said the returned documents would become part of the Trump Presidential Library. He criticised special counsel Jack Smith, who had led the investigation, saying, ""The department of Justice has just returned the boxes that deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,"" he said, adding, ""I did absolutely nothing wrong.""","Fbi returns boxes of documents taken from us president donald trump’s mar-a-lago estate during a 2022 search.

WATCH: Trump argues with Zelenskyy in Oval Office

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was put on the spot during a press conference on Friday when a reporter asked why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, ""You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit.""Zelenskyy, known for his signature military-style clothing, responded by asking the reporter if he had an issue with his outfit.

He reiterated that the Ukrainian president's ""wardrobe is a reflection of his lack of respect for the US.""His comments came amid a tense visit to Washington, where he met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Trump appeared to make a pointed remark about Zelenskyy’s attire, greeting him with, ""Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!"" as the Ukrainian leader, dressed in his usual black sweater, entered the room.The meeting quickly took a dramatic turn, with Trump berating Zelenskyy for being ""disrespectful"" and abruptly cancelling a minerals deal that had been expected to bring Ukraine closer to securing vital support from the US. The tense exchange reportedly led to Zelenskyy being escorted from the White House by top Trump advisers.During the heated discussion, Trump accused Zelenskyy of ""gambling with World War III"" and suggested that Ukraine had not shown enough gratitude for American assistance. Vice President JD Vance also criticised the Ukrainian leader, stating, ""I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""Zelenskyy, in response, defended his position and warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could not be trusted.

All hype and no bite? No new bombshells as justice dept releases ‘Epstein Files’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-hype-and-no-bite-no-new-bombshells-as-justice-dept-releases-epstein-files/articleshow/118640334.cms,"(Inputs from NYT and AP)

For days, attorney general Pam Bondi had talked about releasing the “Epstein files”, supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein But the roughly 200 pages of documents that Bondi released Thursday contained little new information pointing to wrongdoing by anyone other than Epstein, a registered sex offender who died in jail. The document dump largely consisted of flight logs for Epstein’s planes — long ago made public — and contact information for hundreds of associates, along with brief descriptions of items found at his residences.The release was billed as a gesture ushering in a new era of transparency at the justice department . But the hyped first release of documents, which Bondi teased as “breaking news” in a Fox News appearance Wednesday night, appeared to be mostly political theatre. On Thursday afternoon, Bondi and Kash Patel, director of the FBI , offered a sneak preview of the documents to several conservative influencers, some of whom emerged from West Wing waving chunky white binders with the label “Epstein Files: Phase I.” One of them later cal led it an “interesting souvenir.”But by midafternoon, the justice department had not posted the contents. And Bondi was drawing criticism on social media from those who had taken her at her word the night before. Bondi responded by promising more documents to come. Later, she said a “source” in the FBI field office in New York City had told her the bureau withheld “thousands” of previously unknown pages of Epstein-related documents and that she was determined to get them. The documents were released late Thursday, along with a statement from Patel that said: “If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them.” Still, some Republicans in Congress took to X to voice displeasure. “Get us the information we asked for!” wrote RepresentativeAnna Paulina Luna.Much of the material, including transcripts of victim interviews and old police reports, had already been publicly known. They included mentions of Trump, ex-president Bill Clinton, UK’s Prince Andrew and magician David Copperfield, as well as testimony from one victim who said she met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Florida home but nothing untoward happened with him.","Pam bondi had talked about releasing the “epstein files’, supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of jeffrey epstein.

Trump: Putin would abide by any Ukraine peace deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-putin-would-abide-by-any-ukraine-peace-deal/articleshow/118640279.cms,"File photo

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he trusted Russian President Putin not to violate the terms of a potential peace deal with Ukraine, even as he refused to pledge US military support for a peacekeeping force. “I think he’ll keep his word,” Trump said of Putin as he hosted Britain’s PM, Keir Starmer, at the White House. Of Putin, the president said, “I’ve known him for a long time now.”Trump’s comments underscored his embrace of Putin ahead of meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Trump has ended the diplomatic isolation of Russia, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia and repeatedly disparaged Zelensky, including by calling him a “dictator.” He appeared to change his tune Thursday. “I have a lot of respect for him,” Trump said. Earlier in the news conference, when asked if he still thought Zelensky was a dictator, Trump deadpanned: “Uh, did I say that? I can’t believe I said that.”Starmer was the latest in a series of European leaders to come to Washington hoping to reason with Trump.“History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” Starmer said as he stood next to Trump. “The UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working closely with our allies. Because that is the only way peace will last,” the PM said. But his efforts to nudge Trump in Ukraine’s direction appeared not to have not worked. Trump made no mention of US forces supporting a peacekeeping mission that included UK troops.In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was asked what would happen if Britain sent peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, only for Russia to renege on a peace deal. Would the Americans come to the aid of the British in Ukraine? In the span of a minute, Trump seemed to say no (“They can take care of themselves very well”), and then yes (“If they need help, I’ll always be with the British”), before landing back on no (“They don’t need help”). “Could you take on Russia by yourselves?” Trump asked Starmer. Uneasy laughter broke out in the room.","“i think he’ll keep his word,” trump said of putin as he hosted britain’s pm, keir starmer.
