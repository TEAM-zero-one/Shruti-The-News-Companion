Viswashkumar's account of the crash

Rescued from the debris

Survivor’s phone went dead after 3 calls: Last conversations before silence

All 15 passengers from Diu identified; just 1 survivor: Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar

In the tragedy that claimed 241 lives, Viswashkumar Ramesh — a British citizen of Indian origin — emerged as the sole survivor of Air India flight AI-171, a rare miracle amid immense grief.The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon, killing nearly everyone on board and on the ground. Among the passengers were Viswashkumar and his brother, Ajaykumar Ramesh. Within 30 seconds, fate tore the siblings apart forever.Viswashkumar, seated in Seat 11A, somehow staggered out of the wreckage — bloodied, dazed, and alive. His brother, who sat across the aisle in Seat 11J, is feared dead.A British citizen of Indian descent, Viswashkumar has lived in the UK for over 15 years.He and his brother Ajaykumar hailed from Diu, a coastal town in India. They were among 15 residents from Bucharwada and Vanakbara villages on the flight.In London, the brothers ran a garment business, while also managing a fishing enterprise back in Diu.From his hospital bed in Ward B7, Bed 11 of Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, Viswashkumar told his cousin Dhirendra Somabhai that the aircraft made a strange noise and seemed to hang mid-air before the pilot’s chilling distress call: “Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!”He remembers little else — just jumping through a door, then waking amid chaos.Bystanders and rescue teams pulled him out of the burning debris. Video clips show him stumbling, bloodied, and shouting in Gujarati: “Plane fatyo che! Plane fatyo che!” (The plane exploded).At the hospital, overwhelmed with shock and loss, he cried: “Where is my brother? Leave me alone. I don’t want to talk. Can anyone tell me where he is?”According to Ayub Mansuri, a close family friend who had driven the brothers to the airport that morning, Viswashkumar’s father in London informed them about the crash.“I spoke to Viswash three times after the crash. Then his phone went dead,” Mansuri said. “I rushed to the hospital and found him with head injuries and bruises.”The night before the crash, Viswash and his cousin Dhirendra were together in Patelwadi.“He told me, ‘I don’t know when we’ll meet next,’” Dhirendra recalled, now haunted by the memory.Around 2:30pm, officials sealed off the hospital ward after identifying him as the lone survivor. The Gujarat ATS and Ahmedabad Crime Branch have since restricted access to ensure safety and assist in the ongoing investigation.Diu additional district magistrate Vivek Kumar confirmed: “All 15 passengers from our region have been identified. Only one has survived. A team from our administration has already left for Ahmedabad.”In the midst of a nation mourning its worst aviation disaster in recent memory, Viswashkumar Ramesh’s survival is both a mystery and a miracle — a lone light in a sky darkened by loss.","Viswashkumar ramesh, a british citizen of indian origin, is the sole survivor of air india flight ai-171.

NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted. This has in the past forced airlines to take longer detours in that area whenever conflict escalates.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of safety of our passengers, (some) Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said he received a phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who briefed him on the evolving security situation following Israel’s airstrikes on Iranian targets.In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Received a phone call from PM @netanyahu of Israel. He briefed me on the evolving situation. I shared India's concerns and emphasized the need for early restoration of peace and stability in the region.”The conversation comes amid growing international alarm after Israel launched a wide-ranging assault on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, reportedly killing senior officials and scientists.Netanyahu’s office confirmed that he has spoken with several global leaders, including those of India, Germany, and France, and is expected to speak with US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and UK PM Keir Starmer. According to Israel, the leaders “showed understanding for Israel's defense needs in the face of the Iranian threat of annihilation.”Israel said the strikes were necessary in light of direct threats from Iran.“The leaders showed understanding for Israel’s defense needs in the face of the Iranian threat of annihilation,” Netanyahu’s office said.India on Friday said it is ""deeply concerned"" over the recent developments between Iran and Israel and ""closely monitoring"" the evolving situation.New Delhi urged both countries to avoid any escalatory steps.According to international media reports, Israel has carried out strikes at various places in Iran, targeting nuclear and missile sites, and top military officers.Israel Defense Forces spokesperson BG Effie Defrin described the airstrikes as “precise, preemptive” targeting of Iran’s nuclear enrichment and weaponisation facilities, warning that Iran was now closer than ever to producing a nuclear bomb.Netanyahu, in a televised address, said the military action was necessary: “Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. Last year alone, they fired 300 ballistic missiles at Israel. Soon, those could carry nuclear warheads. This is an intolerable threat.

Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026.

'The world cannot stay silent': IDF



'Second barrage of missiles from Iran': IDF confirms



'I think it's been excellent': Donald Trump







A tense escalation unfolded across the Middle East overnight, as Iran launched back to back, and overnight missile strikes toward Israel late Friday and early Saturday. The move came in response to what Iran described as Israel’s earlier attacks on its territory.The confrontation began with Israel’s ""greatest military operations in history,"" against Iran.In a sweeping and highly coordinated attack on Thursday night, Israeli warplanes and drones, some of them reportedly smuggled into Iranian territory in advance, struck deep inside the Islamic Republic.Key targets included parts of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, ballistic missile production sites, and command centers. The strike also killed top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at central Tel Aviv, following a warning from its military that ""everyone will feel it.""Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had cautioned that Israel ""should expect severe punishment"" in response to its sweeping attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities and top military officials.""In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime's most significant enrichment facility, and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,"" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a defiant video address. ""The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.""Netanyahu also addressed the people of Iran directly: ""To the proud people of Iran, we are in the midst of one of the greatest military operations in history, Operation Rising Lion. The Islamic regime, which has oppressed you for almost 50 years, threatens to destroy our country, the State of Israel. More is on the way.""That promise of escalation was swiftly realised — by both sides.Late Friday night, Iran responded with a salvo of ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territory. Explosions thundered over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as sirens blared and the Israeli military urged residents to take cover.Buildings shook under the pressure of near-simultaneous detonations, with several of them likely the result of Israel’s air defence systems intercepting incoming threats.In a pointed statement, Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the retaliatory attacks.""Using a combination of precision-guided and smart systems,"" the IRGC said, ""Iran targeted military centers and airbases that served as the source of the criminal aggression against our country.""The IRGC added that its missiles struck Israeli military-industrial centers that produce missiles and other war equipment, stating that ""field reports, satellite imagery, and intercepted intelligence indicate that dozens of ballistic missiles effectively hit strategic targets.""""Despite claims of interception, the enemy failed to counter the waves of missile strikes launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" the statement continued.But Israel maintained it had successfully intercepted a significant portion of the threat.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) released footage of a Navy missile ship intercepting five Iranian drones over Israeli waters early Saturday. ""Attached is documentation of the interception of two drones launched earlier today from Iran,"" the IDF posted on social media platform X.The IDF also published a map highlighting areas across Israel currently under threat from Iranian attacks, warning, ""Israeli civilians are currently being targeted by the Iranian regime. The world cannot stay silent.""Inside a fortified command center, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant conducted ongoing situation assessments. According to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN, the leadership is ""fully engaged in real-time military coordination and strategic planning.""The attacks did not cease after Netanyahu's fiery speech. Minutes after his video was posted, more Iranian missiles were launched, with renewed explosions reported in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

""Of course we support Israel in its actions,"" Trump told CNN. ""Iran better agree to a nuclear deal before there is nothing left.""“I think it’s been excellent,” Trump told ABC News about the Israeli strikes. “We gave Iran a chance, and they didn’t take it. They got hit—hard. As hard as you can get hit. And there’s more coming. A lot more.”Trump wrote on his Truth Social: ""Two months ago I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to “make a deal.” They should have done it! Today is day 61.

Trying to shake the regime







""The time has come for the Iranian people to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday in a video statement after Israel struck over 200 military and nuclear sites in Iran.The unannounced strikes were clearly meant to disrupt Tehran's nuclear work and increase the time it would take for Iran to produce a nuclear weapon.However, the number of sites hit, the specific nature of the targets, and remarks from Israeli leaders suggest there may be a wider aim: weakening or even removing Iran’s ruling regime.""As we achieve our objective, we are also clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Israeli strikes that hit targets across Iran, including nuclear sites, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists.The attacks early Friday went beyond nuclear plants and missile sites. They also targeted senior members of Iran’s military and nuclear experts — moves that, according to a Reuters report, seem designed to damage Iran’s image internally and among its partners in the region. These are actions that could affect the stability of Iran’s leadership.There is already significant dissatisfaction among many people in Iran due to economic struggles, lack of free expression, and ongoing issues related to women’s and minority rights.In this situation, Netanyahu may be hoping that the extensive airstrikes will lead to unrest within the country that could eventually bring down the Islamic Republic.Some officials in Israel and the United States see the nuclear programme as the main security concern. From that view, Iran should be offered incentives: if it stops pursuing nuclear weapons and ends its support for armed groups, it could have sanctions removed and be reintegrated into the global system.Others believe the real issue is the continued existence of the Islamic Republic. They argue that Iran’s leadership is unlikely to change its regional behaviour and is working not to deter Israel, but to destroy it. From this perspective, diplomatic talks only help Iran buy time. A nuclear programme seen as illegal gives cover to maintain sanctions, which they hope will eventually weaken a regime they consider beyond repair.There is no common ground between these two positions. And now, more clearly than before, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be in the second group. The recent strikes were not mainly focused on nuclear equipment but on top military commanders of the Islamic Republic. The goal, it seems, is not just to set back Iran’s nuclear efforts — but to challenge the regime’s hold on power, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article in Foreign Policy.Israel might believe that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the Iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.This is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is hoping for. But this approach is risky.Even with the damage caused by Israel’s recent attack, there is long-standing hostility toward Israel — not just from Iran’s leadership but also from much of its mostly Shi’ite population. That makes it uncertain whether public anger alone could bring down a well-established religious government that has the support of strong security forces.There is no sign that such a series of events will even begin. And even if it does, there’s no clarity on what direction it would take, a BBC report said.Power in Iran lies mostly with those who control the military and the economy. Much of this power rests with hardliners in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other unelected groups.These groups don’t need to carry out a coup — they already have authority. And they could choose to make Iran more confrontational in response to attacks.Another possible result could be the collapse of the current government, followed by instability in Iran.With a population of nearly 90 million, any unrest in Iran would affect many countries in the Middle East.If Israel is able to remove the Islamic leadership in Tehran, the attack would be seen as successful. But if the leadership stays in place — and history suggests that airstrikes alone rarely bring regime change — then Iran could still keep some part of its nuclear program, Jeffrey Lewis writes.Israel’s national security advisor has already said that Iran might still keep parts of its nuclear capability. So what happens then?One possibility Israel sees is that Iran could agree to a deal with US President Donald Trump to give up its nuclear plans. But another possibility is that Iran could follow North Korea’s path — leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and eventually developing nuclear weapons. In that case, it is unlikely that Russia or China would support new sanctions. They may not even enforce the ones already in place. Russia has been buying Iranian drones, and China imports Iranian oil.The reasons why Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stopped the country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 — and why he kept that policy — are not fully known. There have been different views within Iran: some have wanted a nuclear weapon, while others have not. Until now, those opposing the bomb have been able to influence policy. But after this recent strike, these discussions will likely change. There will also be new individuals involved in these decisions. People will think about those who are no longer there and ask whether Israel would have acted this way if Iran already had nuclear weapons — or if Israel didn’t have them.If the Iranian government doesn’t fall, Israel might feel the need to carry out more attacks in the future. Even if this strike has seriously disrupted Iran’s nuclear efforts, Iran could restart the program.""In the ideal world, Israel would prefer to see a change of regime, no question about that,"" Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, was quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.If Israel succeeds in removing Iran's leadership, there is no guarantee the successor that emerges would not be even more hardline in pursuit of conflict with Israel.""For years, many in Israel have insisted that regime change in Iran would prompt a new and better day - that nothing could be worse than the current theocratic regime,"" Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Middle East was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""But history tells us it can always be worse.""",Israel may be hoping that the recent attacks and killings could destabilize the iranian government and create an opportunity for a public uprising.

Whether it is for goods or services… or the West Midlands as a whole, there is so much good stuff here to celebrate,” the minister added.The UK government estimates the deal could boost bilateral trade by GBP 25.5 billion annually in the long term. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) projects a GDP increase of GBP 4.8 billion and wage growth of GBP 2.2 billion per year over the next decade.The debate in Parliament comes just ahead of UK-India Week, which begins next week as part of the India Global Forum (IGF) summit in London.

Wider war feared





In a statement laced with menace and finality, US President Donald Trump warned Iran to “just do it” and strike a nuclear deal, hours after Israeli airstrikes killed several of Iran’s top military leaders and nuclear scientists in a dramatic escalation in the Middle East.Trump also warned Tehran saying that “the next already planned attacks” would be even more brutal if it didn’t agree to a nuclear deal.“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” Trump said on Truth Social. “I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told... There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.”Trump claimed Iran’s hardliners who had resisted previous peace overtures “are all DEAD now,” and urged Tehran to “Just do it, before it is too late.”He added, “There has already been great death and destruction… Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.”His remarks came shortly after Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a “bitter and painful” response to the Israeli strikes, which Tehran called a “declaration of war.”Among the dead were Iran’s armed forces chief Mohammad Bagheri and Revolutionary Guards head Hossein Salami. Six nuclear scientists were also reportedly killed, including at the Natanz enrichment facility.Israel said it deployed 200 fighter jets and confirmed it had targeted Iran’s core nuclear infrastructure. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the strikes would “continue as many days as it takes,” accusing Tehran of nearing a nuclear weapons threshold.Iran’s Foreign Minister, in a letter to the UN, demanded an emergency response. Meanwhile, US officials maintained that they had no role in the Israeli operation, though Trump admitted to Fox News he had prior knowledge.“I told them it would be much worse than anything they know,” Trump said, boasting of US and Israeli military supremacy. “Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come, and they know how to use it.”Airports shut down, Gulf carriers suspended flights, and oil prices spiked. As the region braced for further fallout, Trump insisted diplomacy was still possible: “No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”Iran’s armed forces chief Mohammad Bagheri and Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami were among those killed in the strikes, which also claimed the lives of at least six nuclear scientists, according to Iranian media. Israel said it had struck over 100 targets across Iran, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirming that “the heart of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme” had been hit.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a “bitter and painful” retaliation. In a letter to the United Nations, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called on the Security Council to address what he described as an act of war.Iran’s military warned there would be “no limits” to its response. State media reported civilian deaths, including women and children, and showed images of damaged buildings, including one in Tehran hit by what appeared to be a precision strike.Trump told Fox News he had prior knowledge of the Israeli strikes, which Israel said involved 200 fighter jets. Trump also stressed that Tehran ""cannot have a nuclear bomb"".Trump said he believed a nuclear deal with Iran was “fairly close” prior to the attack but admitted the Israeli action might have changed the calculus: “I don’t want them going in… Might help it actually, but it also could blow it.”Israel declared a state of emergency and closed its airspace. Jordan intercepted drones and missiles that crossed into its airspace, while Iraq, Jordan, and Iran halted all commercial flights. Gulf airlines canceled operations in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport was shut, and long queues formed at petrol stations across the capital.The Israeli military said intelligence had shown Iran was nearing the “point of no return” in its nuclear ambitions. The IAEA confirmed Natanz was among the targets and said it was “closely monitoring” the situation.The attack comes amid ongoing regional hostilities, including Israel’s war in Gaza and skirmishes with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen. Netanyahu has pledged less restraint since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack, which Iran supported.The United States has drawn down staff from regional bases, wary of Iranian threats. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Tehran against dragging Washington into the conflict, saying the US was not involved and should not be targeted.Despite the soaring tensions, Trump insisted a diplomatic path still exists, if Iran acts fast: “There is still time to make this slaughter… come to an end.”","Us president donald trump warns iran to 'just do it' and strike a nuclear deal.

Whistleblowers had been raising safety concerns over the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whistleblowers-had-been-raising-safety-concerns-over-the-boeing-787-dreamliner-for-years/articleshow/121811068.cms,"Representative image





LONDON: Concerns had been raised by whistleblowers for years over the safety of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft which crashed in Ahmedabad on Thursday.John Barnett, who had worked for Boeing for more than 30 years and had been employed as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant, which builds the 787 Dreamliner, had alleged to the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been “deliberately” fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line to prevent delays on the production line.Barnett, who retired in 2017, alleged he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken. After retiring in 2017, he commenced legal action against the company and in the week before his sudden death in March 2024, from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.He had also claimed he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.He had said that soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something Boeing has denied. He had said that in some cases, sub-standard parts had even “been removed from scrap bins” and fitted to planes that were being built.Another whistleblower, current Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, had in April 2024 told NBC News that Boeing should “ground every 787 Dreamliner jet worldwide” after warning they are at risk of premature failure.He alleged that crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage. His attorneys said this put more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking catastrophic failure.Salehpour, who has worked at Boeing for more than a decade, also claimed he faced retaliation, including exclusion from meetings, after raising concerns over these issues.Boeing has always denied these assertions and insists the 787 is safe.However the Federal Aviation Administration is currently investigating Salehpour’s allegations. It also opened an investigation in May 2024 after Boeing disclosed in April 2024 that it may not have completed required inspections to confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliners. That probe is also investigating whether company employees falsified aircraft records.The aircraft involved in Thursday’s crash is an 11-year-old Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. This is the first major accident involving the 787.Boeing issued the following statement: “We are in contact with Air India regarding Flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.”","Concerns had been raised by whistleblowers for years over the safety of the boeing 787 dreamliner aircraft which crashed in ahmedabad on thursday.

With the stock hitting record highs, Ellison reaffirmed his dominance in the tech industry, not just as a business leader but as one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, surpassing even the GDP of several small countries.The jump in Ellison's wealth followed Oracle's after-earnings rally that pushed its stock to an all-time closing price of $200. During the Wednesday afternoon announcement, Oracle logged better-than-expected quarter-ending financial results. The company had $1.70 of adjusted earnings per share and $15.9 billion of revenue, beating Wall Street estimates.

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday distanced itself from a statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) condemning recent Israeli strikes on Iran, clarifying that it did not participate in the discussions that led to the group's remarks.In a statement, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said, “The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has issued a statement on recent developments between Israel and Iran. India did not participate in the discussions on the above-mentioned SCO statement.”The MEA reaffirmed India's independent stance on the Israel-Iran tensions, first articulated on June 13, and reiterated its call for calm and dialogue. “We urge that channels of dialogue and diplomacy be utilised to work towards de-escalation. It is essential that the international community undertake endeavours in that direction,” the statement read.External affairs minister S Jaishankar also conveyed India’s concerns directly to his Iranian counterpart during a recent conversation. According to the MEA, Jaishankar highlighted the international community's deep concern over the rising tensions and emphasized the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic engagement.The SCO statement had strongly denounced Israel’s strikes on Iranian territory, describing them as “aggressive actions against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure,” which it said caused civilian casualties and violated international law and the UN Charter. It also reaffirmed support for resolving tensions around Iran’s nuclear program through peaceful and diplomatic means and expressed condolences to the Iranian people and government.India, however, reiterated its independent stance, first stated on June 13, which emphasized restraint, dialogue, and diplomacy. “India urges both sides to avoid any escalatory steps. Existing channels of dialogue and diplomacy should be utilised to work towards a de-escalation of the situation and resolving underlying issues,” the earlier MEA statement had said.The ministry added that Jaishankar had recently spoken with his Iranian counterpart, conveying the deep concern of the international community and reiterating the need to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic processes.India emphasized its “close and friendly relations with both countries” and reaffirmed its readiness to extend support towards efforts for peace.

Mid-air escape: Air India London-Delhi flight entered Iran airspace as Israel struck with missiles; rerouted over Iraq,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mid-air-escape-air-india-london-delhi-flight-entered-iran-airspace-as-israel-struck-with-missiles-rerouted-over-iraq/articleshow/121831814.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Air India flight from London to New Delhi had just entered Iranian airspace when Israel launched a wave of missile strikes on Iran’s military and nuclear sites.The flight was rerouted over Iraq before arriving in India one hour late, according to an AFP report.The close call was one of several disruptions on Friday as Air India diverted or turned back at least 16 international flights mid-air due to the sudden escalation and subsequent closure of Iranian airspace. Among those affected were services between India and cities like London, Toronto, and New York.Aircraft tracking site Flight Aware showed that two other Air India flights — from Delhi to Vienna and Mumbai to London — were nearing Iranian airspace and turned back to their origin airports shortly after the strikes began.In a statement, Air India said: “Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace and in view of the safety of our passengers, the following Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen disruption and are making every effort to minimise it.”The airline is offering full refunds or complimentary rescheduling to affected passengers and is arranging accommodation where necessary.The Indian Embassy in Iran also issued an advisory urging Indian nationals and people of Indian origin to stay alert and avoid non-essential travel, as tensions surged following Israel’s precision strikes targeting Iranian defence infrastructure.Iran, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria temporarily shut down their airspace, leading to widespread cancellations and rerouting of global flights to and from the Middle East. Global airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv and Tehran as air traffic over the region thinned out overnight.Israel said the strikes were a direct response to the growing threat from Iran’s missile and nuclear capabilities. Iran retaliated by launching a wave of drones toward Israeli territory.","The flight was rerouted over iraq before arriving in india one hour late.

Who is Anirudh Ravichander?







Music composer Anirudh Ravichander has put to rest the wave of speculation surrounding his alleged wedding plans with Sunrisers Hyderabad co-owner Kavya Maran. After social media buzzed with claims of the duo dating and preparing to tie the knot, Anirudh took to X on Saturday to clarify the situation.""Marriage ah? lol... Chill out guys. Please stop spreading rumours,"" Anirudh posted, ending the frenzy of speculation that had dominated online chatter. While the composer’s post rubbished the marriage talk, he chose not to address rumours about dating Kavya, which intensified after alleged sightings of the two at a dinner outing.The origin of the rumours can be traced back to a Reddit thread that claimed the two had been in a relationship for over a year and that superstar Rajinikanth had spoken to Kavya’s father, media baron Kalanithi Maran , about a possible alliance. The speculative story quickly gained traction and led to multiple media reports suggesting a wedding announcement was imminent.Anirudh comes from a distinguished artistic family. He is the son of actor Ravi Raghavendra, nephew of Latha Rajinikanth, and has scored music for top stars across Indian cinema — from Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan to Shah Rukh Khan.Kavya Maran, on the other hand, is the daughter of Sun Group chairman Kalanithi Maran and is a prominent face during IPL seasons.",Music composer anirudh ravichander has put to rest the wave of speculation surrounding his alleged wedding plans with sunrisers hyderabad co-owner kavya maran.

'Historic blunder': Himanta says India missed chance to stop Pakistan from becoming nuclear state; claims Israel offered help,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/historic-blunder-himanta-says-india-missed-chance-to-stop-pakistan-from-becoming-nuclear-state-claims-israel-offered-help/articleshow/121848507.cms,"Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday that the Congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing Pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s without taking action.He said Pakistan has since used ""nuclear blackmail"" to block international intervention.""At a time when nations today act decisively to neutralise nuclear threats, India’s tragic inaction during the 1980s remains a cautionary tale of what could have been—and what wasn't,"" the Assam CM said in a long post on X.Sarma said intelligence from R&AW had confirmed Pakistan’s uranium enrichment at Kahuta.In his post titled ""Congress's Historic Blunder: How India Let Pakistan Become a Nuclear State"", he claimed Israel offered help—from intel to joint strike planning. He said Jamnagar Air Base was shortlisted as a launch site and the Indian military supported a pre-emptive strike on Kahuta.""India had the capability and consensus to eliminate the threat before it became a reality. Yet at the last minute: Indira Gandhi hesitated, fearing international fallout,"" the chief minister alleged.He added that Rajiv Gandhi later ""shelved the plan, prioritising diplomacy over deterrence under foreign pressure"".According to Sarma, in 1988 Rajiv Gandhi signed a no-strike nuclear pact with Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto, pledging not to attack each other’s nuclear sites.He noted, ""A decade later, Pakistan tested nuclear weapons in 1998. India was pulled into a costly nuclear arms race. Kargil, proxy terror wars, and cross-border strikes have since occurred under Pakistan’s nuclear shield.""""To this day, Pakistan uses nuclear blackmail to deter international action and legitimize its rogue behaviour,"" he said.Sarma also accused the CPI(M), an INDIA bloc ally, of promising in their 2024 manifesto to roll back India’s nuclear deterrent if elected.“Where strong leadership demands resolve and foresight, Congress offered caution and delay. A historic window to safeguard India’s long-term security was squandered—for short-term diplomatic comfort,” he said.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma said on saturday that the congress made a ""historic blunder"" by allowing pakistan to become a nuclear power in the 1980s.

Netanyahu’s Iran strike: A rebuke to Trump’s 'Man of Peace' pledge; what's next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/netanyahus-iran-strike-a-rebuke-to-trumps-man-of-peace-pledge-whats-next/articleshow/121826303.cms,"Damages are seen in a building after an explosion in a residence compound after Israel attacked Iran's capital Tehran (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)

Why it matters

Trump’s peacemaker promise under fire: From the outset of his second term on January 20, 2025, Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a Gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in Oman and vowing to end the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu’s unilateral strike not only undermines those diplomatic efforts but also exposes the limits of Trump’s influence over a key ally.

From the outset of his second term on January 20, 2025, Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a Gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in Oman and vowing to end the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu’s unilateral strike not only undermines those diplomatic efforts but also exposes the limits of Trump’s influence over a key ally. Shortly after the strikes, Trump said on social media platform Truth Social: I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to “just do it,” but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done. I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it. Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse! There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All! (SIC)

US-Israel relations strained: Though Israel relies on Washington for weapons and intelligence, this mission proceeded without US coordination. Secretary of state Marco Rubio stressed “we are not involved in strikes against Iran” and urged Tehran “not to target US interests” (AFP). The disconnect has prompted questions about whether America will be drawn into defending Israel if Iran retaliates.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio stressed “we are not involved in strikes against Iran” and urged Tehran “not to target US interests” (AFP). The disconnect has prompted questions about whether America will be drawn into defending Israel if Iran retaliates. Regional stability at risk: The attack risks igniting fresh conflicts across the Middle East. Iran has already vowed “decisive” retaliation against its “sworn enemies,” heightening the possibility of strikes on US bases, Red Sea shipping by Houthi proxies and renewed hostilities in Gaza and Syria.

Zoom in

Natanz’s resilience: Buried deep under mountains, the Natanz enrichment halls have withstood previous Israeli sabotage and covert operations. While jets can inflict damage, restoring capacity-swapping centrifuges, repairing cascades-can take weeks, not years. Last year’s strikes set Iran back by an estimated 12–18 months; this round may only marginally extend that delay without sustained pressure.

Mossad’s covert campaign: According to senior Israeli officials, a parallel sabotage effort led by Mossad targeted Iran’s air defenses and missile depots over the past year. These clandestine actions-planting explosives, cyber intrusions-underscore that the air campaign is but the visible tip of a multifaceted strategy to “roll back the Iranian threat.”

Gulf state jitters: Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha are bracing for fallout. US-brokered normalization deals hang in the balance as Gulf monarchies weigh security guarantees against the risk of becoming battlegrounds in a US-Israel-Iran showdown.

The big picture

A fractured peacemaking track record:

Emerging US-Israel strategic divergence:

Netanyahu’s calculus: Facing what he deems an existential threat from a “cleric-run government” backing Hamas, Netanyahu judged that delaying invites a nuclear-capable Iran. He has already ordered similar strikes on air defenses last year and quietly overseen sabotage operations inside Iran attributed to Mossad-indicating a long-built contingency rather than a spur-of-the-moment choice

What they’re saying

Benjamin Netanyahu: “This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat,” he said, confirming strikes on Iran’s “main enrichment facility at Natanz” and its ballistic-missile program.

Marco Rubio: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” he said, warning Tehran “should not target US interests or personnel.”

Justin Logan, Cato Institute: The strike will “destroy US diplomatic efforts” and “Israel has the right to choose its own foreign policy…At the same time, it has the responsibility to bear the costs of that policy.”

Tom Cotton, US Senator: The United States must “back Israel to the hilt, all the way,” including “topple\[ing] Iran’s Islamic Republic if it targets US troops” .

Jack Reed, US Senator (D-RI): “Israel’s alarming decision to launch airstrikes on Iran is a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence,” he warned on the Senate Armed Services Committee floor.

MAGA’s moment of truth

What’s next

US policy decision: Trump has convened the National Security Council to chart a response. Options range from strictly defensive support-air refueling and intelligence sharing-to direct involvement if Iran strikes US forces.

Iranian counter-strikes: Tehran’s Revolutionary Guards promise “decisive retaliation.” Potential targets include US bases in the Gulf, shipping lanes in the Red Sea via Houthi drones and missiles, and proxy actions in Syria and Lebanon.

Diplomatic deadlock: The scheduled June 15 talks in Oman are imperiled. Iran may withdraw to reassess, while US willingness to negotiate under fire will be tested. GCC monarchies, once champions of Trump’s outreach, now face heightened insecurity.

Energy markets: Oil prices spiked over 5% on Friday, reflecting fears of prolonged disruption across Middle East export routes and potential Houthi attacks on commercial vessels .





On Thursday night, Israeli jets unleashed a coordinated “preemptive” air campaign against Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure-bombing enrichment facilities at Natanz, key Revolutionary Guards installations in Tehran and ballistic-missile sites around the country-just hours after President Donald Trump publicly implored Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off. Netanyahu named the operation “Rising Lion,” warning it would “continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat”.Trump’s diplomacy hinged on high-profile announcements and personal outreach-his Sunday summit with Qatar’s emir promising “no nuclear dust” over the region, the planned June 15 meeting in Muscat between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian officials, and last month’s removal of Syria sanctions. Yet each initiative has stumbled: Gaza talks collapsed; Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed a Ukraine ceasefire; and now Netanyahu has effectively sidelined the Oman talks.“We’ve clearly seen a fork in the road in the American and Israeli approaches to this problem set,” observes Dana Stroul, former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.The US favored patience while negotiations ran their course; Israel opted for immediate military action to “delay and degrade” Iran’s program. Whether the two will coordinate follow-on steps to maximize the setback remains uncertain.Inside the MAGA movement, fury erupted. As per a Politico report, many in Trump’s base saw in the Israeli strike both a personal affront and a political trap. Breitbart’s Matt Boyle warned that Trump now faces a defining moment: “He has to balance protecting America’s greatest ally in the region in Israel with avoiding getting the USA drawn into war” .Breaking Points host Saagar Enjeti was even more blunt: “Israel has now made a mockery of the United States … a blatant attempt to force us into war. We must resist,” he declared, insisting Trump’s longtime criticism of “stupid leaders who pursue disastrous foreign wars” should guide his response .Charlie Kirk, live-streaming the chaos to his Turning Point USA followers, lamented that the strike “is now going to have major American domestic implications,” warning of a coming schism in the movement. Mollie Hemingway of The Federalist warned that any US backing of the strike “would be seen as an unforgivable betrayal by millions of American voters,” putting Trump in an “impossible position.”Even more hawkish voices in his party-Senator Tom Cotton among them-quickly rallied behind Israel, calling to “back Israel to the hilt, all the way,” with some urging that the United States pressure Tehran’s regime to its knees if it dared strike back at US forces .(With inputs from agencies)","Trump cast himself as a global deal-maker-securing a gaza ceasefire, brokering talks in oman and vowing to end the wars in gaza, ukraine and curb iran’s nuclear ambitions.
