Government promises speedy trial as arrests continue







The brother of slain youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi accused Bangladesh’s interim government, of orchestrating the killing to destabilise the country and derail the upcoming national election in February.Sharif Omar bin Hadi, speaking at a protest rally in Shahbagh on Tuesday, said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder, which took place just days after the election schedule was announced. Osman Hadi, a convenor of the political platform Inqilab Moncho, was shot on December 12 and later died of his injuries in Singapore on December 18.Addressing a “Shahidi Shopoth” programme organised by Inqilab Moncho outside the National Museum, Omar Hadi accused “a quarter within the government” of planning the killing to disrupt the electoral process. “It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” he said as quoted by The DailyStar.He said his brother had been firmly in favour of holding elections by February and had actively worked on the ground to prepare for them. “Respecting his wish, we demand that the election environment is not disturbed,” Omar Hadi said, warning that the government had so far shown “no visible progress” in delivering justice.He claimed Osman Hadi was targeted because he refused to bow to any agency or “foreign masters”. If justice was denied, Omar Hadi warned, those responsible would one day be forced to flee the country. Protesters later took an oath vowing to remain on the streets until “speedy and exemplary justice” was secured.Earlier, Inqilab Moncho’s member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber, speaking as the keynote speaker, alleged a “deep conspiracy” involving international intelligence agencies and domestic “fascist associates” aimed at undermining Bangladesh’s sovereignty and the gains of the July uprising.The platform has given the government a 30-working-day deadline to identify and arrest the killers, warning of tougher nationwide programmes if the demand is not met. While the group said it would pause formal protests on December 25, the day BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman is due to return to Bangladesh, it announced wall-writing and social media campaigns across December 24 and 25, with further agitation planned from December 26.In a parallel development, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina also blamed the interim government for the deteriorating law-and-order situation, saying the killing reflected “lawlessness” under Yunus.The interim government has rejected suggestions of inaction, with Law Adviser Asif Nazrul saying the case would be tried under the Speedy Trial Tribunal Act, requiring completion within 90 days of the investigation report being filed. Home Adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the case was being treated as a top priority.Joint forces comprising police, the Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh have arrested at least 10 people so far, including family members of the prime suspect, Faisal Karim Masud. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to arrest the main accused.Osman Hadi’s killing came a day after the Bangladesh Election Commission announced February 12 as the date for the next national polls. A prominent figure of the 'July Uprising' and a potential candidate for Dhaka-8, his death had fuelled major protests in Bangladesh.","Sharif omar bin hadi said those in power could not evade responsibility for his brother’s murder.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari has recounted how he came face to face with Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh just hours before the latter was assassinated in Tehran, linking the incident to what he described as the growing role of technology in modern conflict and national security.Speaking at a book launch event, Gadkari said he had travelled to Iran at the request of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to represent India at the swearing-in ceremony of Iran’s newly elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian. According to the minister, foreign dignitaries were staying at a five-star hotel in Tehran ahead of the ceremony.“I had gone for the Iranian Prime Minister's ceremony. There is a 5-star hotel there where all heads of state stayed. Modi ji had sent me,” Gadkari said.He recalled noticing one individual among the dignitaries who was not a head of state. “I wondered who he was. I also shook hands and asked. He was the head of Hamas,” he said, adding that Haniyeh later walked into the ceremony alongside Iran’s president and chief justice, while other delegates followed.Gadkari further described how he was woken early in the morning amid the chaos of Haniyeh’s assassinations.“I also came to my hotel and after eating dinner, went to sleep. At 4 o'clock, the ambassador came and knocked on the door saying ""Sir, we have to evacuate."" I asked why. He said there's been a big problem. What happened? He said the Hamas leader who was here yesterday, a powerful man, was killed in his room.”Iranian authorities later confirmed that Haniyeh was killed at around 1.15am on July 31, 2024, while staying in a highly secure military complex under the supervision of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). His bodyguard was also killed in the attack, according to official statements cited by the Associated Press.Gadkari told the audience that the exact method of the assassination remained unclear. He went on to suggest how the future high-tech is important from the perspective of national security, modern warfare, and critical infrastructure.“No one knows from where the missile was fired, where it entered - now some say it was his mobile phone number, he was specially hidden in one place in a bungalow, went to that room and killed him there. So the coming time is futuristic, technology and futuristic vision for development in defence, agriculture, industry, trade, business export - we will have to do all this.”At the same event, Gadkari remarked that strong nations are difficult to target, citing Israel as an example of how technological and military capability translate into global influence.Iran’s revolutionary guards authorities had said a short-range missile was used to strike the building where Haniyeh was staying.The Telegraph claimed that Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad may have orchestrated the killing by planting explosives inside the guesthouse, citing Iranian officials.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called k-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine ins arighaat in the bay of bengal on tuesday.

(With inputs from agencies)

Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with us special envoy for south and central asia sergio gor.

Clark Hunt and Jerry Jones are two of the most important names in NFL ownership. Both men own famous franchises and come from wealthy business families, but their wealth is extremely different in terms of how much they have, where it came from, and where it is going. Jones is one of the richest sports owners in the world as of 2025. Hunt, on the other hand, has a quieter, multi-generational fortune that comes from heritage ownership.What is Jerry Jones' net worth?Forbes says that Jerry Jones is valued about $16.6 billion in 2025. The Dallas Cowboys, the most valuable team in all of sports, are where much of his money comes from. Forbes says the Cowboys are worth more than $13 billion right now, making them the first sports club to reach that level.Jones bought the Cowboys for $150 million in 1989, which at first made some doubt him. Over the years, he turned the team into a money-making machine by coming up with new ways to get sponsors for stadiums, sell merchandise, and offer premium seating. Jones has made a lot of money through oil and gas investments, especially his majority ownership in Comstock Resources. Those energy interests are now worth as much as, and in some years more than, the Cowboys' contribution to his wealth.What is Clark Hunt’s net worth?Clark Hunt's personal wealth is thought to be between $1.6 billion and $2 billion. The Hunt family's wealth as a whole is thought to be between $15 billion and $25 billion, depending on market conditions. Hunt did not buy his NFL franchise, unlike Jones. His father, Lamar Hunt Sr., started the Kansas City Chiefs. He was one of the people who helped create contemporary professional football and the American Football League.Clark Hunt owns around 25% of the Chiefs, which are worth nearly $6.2 billion right now. The franchise has had a lot of success on the field since Patrick Mahomes joined, but the money goes to different family members. The Hunt family's fortune comes mostly from oil and gas through Hunt Oil Company. They also have long-term stakes in real estate, hotels, and other sports teams, such as FC Dallas in Major League Soccer.Who wins: Clark Hunt or Jerry Jones?The difference in wealth between Jones and Hunt shows how they work. Jones is a businessman that is very hands-on and aggressive. He used debt, branding, and risk to grow his wealth. Hunt, on the other hand, runs a heritage business that puts stability, long-term growth, and shared family ownership first.In short, Jerry Jones is far richer than Clark Hunt, who is part of one of the richest families in the United States. Both methods have worked in the NFL, showing that there is more than one way to construct a sports empire.Both owners will get even richer as franchise valuations keep going up, but for now, the Cowboys owner is still in a class of his own when it comes to money.","Jerry jones is one of the richest sports owners in the world as of 2025.

Brock Purdy’s late-season surge with the San Francisco 49ers has pulled his family into the public eye

Jenna Purdy’s athletic background and her long relationship timeline with Brock Purdy

As the San Francisco 49ers quarterback closes the regular season on one of the hottest stretches of his career, fans can’t help gushing over his wife Jenna. Brock Purdy just tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes on Monday Night Football. At the same time, photos of his wife Jenna Purdy and their newborn daughter Millie flooded social media during Christmas week.The attention is not random. Brock Purdy missed eight games earlier this season due to injuries. He has since returned and led San Francisco to five straight wins. With the 49ers back in control of the NFC’s top seed race, interest has shifted beyond the stat line. Fans want to know who is standing next to the quarterback during this moment. The answer is Jenna Purdy, a former college athlete who has quietly been part of Brock Purdy’s rise long before the spotlight found her.Brock Purdy delivered one of the most efficient performances of his NFL career on Dec. 22 against the Indianapolis Colts. He threw five touchdown passes in a 48–27 road win, becoming the first San Francisco 49ers quarterback to do so in a regular-season Monday night game since Joe Montana.The win pushed San Francisco to its fifth consecutive victory. With two games remaining, the 49ers control their path to the NFC’s No. 1 seed. They host the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football before closing the regular season against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 18 at Levi’s Stadium.Off the field, Brock Purdy spent Christmas with his wife Jenna Purdy and their daughter Millie, who was born in July 2025. Jenna shared family photos around the Christmas tree and wrote, “Best time of the year. Merry Christmas from the Purdys ❤️.”This season has also reshaped how fans view Brock Purdy. Last year, he gifted Toyota vehicles to teammates. This year, he redirected that gesture toward fans in need, including families with sick children and military veterans. The moment circulated widely online and added context to why interest in his personal life has grown alongside his on-field success.Jenna Purdy, born Jenna Brandt on Oct. 26, 1999, grew up in Sumner, Iowa. She was a standout volleyball player at Sumner-Fredericksburg High School and later committed to Iowa State University. She majored in Kinesiology and played as a setter for the Cyclones.After three seasons at Iowa State, Jenna Brandt transferred to the University of Northern Iowa and finished her collegiate volleyball career there in 2022. Her athletic background mirrors Brock Purdy’s own college path, as both attended Iowa State at the same time.Brock Purdy and Jenna Brandt made their relationship public in November 2022. In July 2023, Brock Purdy proposed in Saint Cloud, Florida. He captioned the announcement, “My Jenna girl forever. I can’t wait to be your husband and grow together in Christ. Here’s to forever babe. I love you JB!”The couple married on March 9, 2024, in Des Moines, Iowa, just weeks after Brock Purdy appeared in Super Bowl LVIII with the San Francisco 49ers. According to The Knot, the wedding took place in their hometown and was planned by White Willow Events. Jenna later shared wedding photos and wrote, “Best day of our lives🤍 I get to call my best friend my HUSBAND for forever and ever!!!!”In July 2025, Brock Purdy and Jenna Purdy quietly welcomed their first child, a daughter named Millie Joleen. They revealed the news after her birth with a joint Instagram post that read, “Millie Joleen Purdy🩷 Life just became a whole lot sweeter.” The decision to skip a public pregnancy announcement surprised many 49ers fans.Since then, Jenna Purdy has been a visible presence at games and practices, often with Millie dressed in 49ers gear. As Brock Purdy’s performances have elevated San Francisco’s playoff position, interest in his wife has followed naturally. Winning quarterbacks draw attention. Stable personal lives keep it.","Brock purdy and his wife jenna purdy welcomed their first child, a daughter named millie joleen, in july 2025.

The holiday season festivities were not over yet, as the Edmonton Oilers and their superstars, Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, Mattias Ekholm, and their partners all took part in a charming moment that immediately caught the attention of the sports community. Playing outdoor ice hockey, mixing winter and Christmas with good entertainment in a very nearby and simple way, were the main things that the Oilers stars did while staying out of decorated arenas and bright NHL lights.On the night before Christmas, the Oilers threesome with their partners made their way to an outdoor rink in Edmonton, transforming a calm holiday night into an easy-going ODR skate. It was all about sharing and enjoying the season together, not about rivalry or the media. The occasion came up on social media through Instagram stories, giving fans a unique view of the players in an unfiltered, off-court atmosphere that connected immediately.The festive skate first appeared on Instagram via Lauren Kyle, Connor McDavid’s wife, who shared a photo originally posted by Celeste Desjardins, Leon Draisaitl’s wife. The image showed the group lined up on the ice, bundled in winter gear, with Celeste captioning it “Christmas Eve at the ODR.”Soon after, the Edmonton Oilers’ official account reposted the moment, calling it “a bit of ODR fun,” giving fans an inside look at the relaxed gathering.Mattias Ekholm decorated it with the cold in his signature fashion. He threw a dark coat over his white beanie and stood next to his wife, who was resplendent in a white puffer. Meanwhile, McDavid made no fuss and just wore a navy jacket and a beanie. Lauren Kyle, on the other hand, was in a warm white jacket.Draisaitl was wearing a navy hoodie that matched so well with Celeste’s tan puffer vest underneath. Later on, Ida Ekholm posted her own snowy selfie with a caption saying she wished her followers a peaceful and happy holiday from Edmonton.The whole season was a rollercoaster of pressure and expectations, but the Christmas Eve ODR skate brought out the human side of the Oilers’ stars. Sometimes, the most memorable moments are those that take place far from the limelight, on frozen outdoor rinks with people who are dear to you.Also Read: Inside Wayne Gretzky’s car collection: Luxury, performance, and timeless elegance","Connor mcdavid, leon draisaitl, and mattias ekholm turned christmas eve into odr magic.

Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio says ‘real AI danger’ began in 2023 because ‘since ChatGPT came out …',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/godfather-of-ai-yoshua-bengio-says-real-ai-danger-began-in-2023-because-since-chatgpt-came-out-/articleshow/126134899.cms,"Dangers Of AI: Is ChatGPT Quietly Harming Your Mental Health? | Global Pulse

Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio’s career advice





Godfather of AI Yoshua Bengio recently admitted that the moment he truly started worrying about artificial intelligence (AI) was not decades into the future, but in 2023 after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Bengio appeared on The Diary Of A CEO podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett where he was asked why an introverted scientist was suddenly stepping into the public eye to talk about AI risks. To this, the Turing Award–winning “Godfather of AI” replied saying “Because I have to. Because since ChatGPT came out, I realized that we were on a dangerous path and I needed to speak.” He continued: “I needed to raise awareness about what could happen, but also to give hope that there are some paths that we could choose in order to mitigate those catastrophic risks.”“What was it about ChatGPT that caused your mind to change?,” the host asked. Bengio replied saying that before ChatGPT, “most my colleagues and myself thought it would take many more decades before we would have machines that actually understand language.”Explaining further, the AI scientist continued: “Alan Turing, founder of the field in 1950, thought that once we have machines that understand language, we might be doomed because they would be as intelligent as us.He wasn’t quite right. So we have machines now that understand language, but they lag in other ways, like planning.”Stating that the AI bots are not a real threat for now, Yoshua Bengio reiterated “but they could be in a few years or a decade or two.”“So it is that realization that we were building something that could become potentially a competitor to humans or that could be giving huge power to whoever controls it and destabilizing our world, threatening our democracy. So all of these scenarios suddenly came to me in the early weeks of 2023, and I realized that I had to do something, everything I could about it,” he said.When asked about jobs getting replaced by AI and career advice for the future generation, Bengio advised to “Work on the beautiful human being that you can become. I think that that part of ourselves will persist even if machines can do most of the jobs"".Continuing further, Bengio said “there will be jobs where we want to have people. If I’m in a hospital, I want a human being to hold my hand while I’m anxious or in pain. The human touch is going to, I think, take more and more value as the other skills become more and more automated.”","Yoshua bengio, the godfather of ai, spoke on the diary of a ceo podcast.

‘Burning minorities to death’: Sheikh Hasina attacks Yunus regime in Bangladesh; accuses 'illegal' power grab,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/burning-minorities-to-death-sheikh-hasina-attacks-yunus-regime-in-bangladesh-accuses-illegal-power-grab/articleshow/126181596.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday accused the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus of perpetrating “unspeakable atrocities” against non-Muslims, alleging that religious minorities were being targeted following her removal from power.In a message issued on the occasion of Christmas, the 78-year-old Awami League leader said the current ruling group had seized power illegally and was setting “horrific precedents such as burning religious minorities to death,” in an apparent reference to the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh last week.“In particular, it is perpetrating unspeakable atrocities against non-Muslims. It has even set horrific precedents such as burning religious minorities to death. I firmly believe that the people of Bangladesh will not allow this dark time to continue any longer,” Hasina said.She also accused the Yunus government of interfering with the freedom of people of all religions and communities to practise their faiths, and said the situation had worsened since her government was ousted in August last year.The Hindu population in Bangladesh has been affected by a series of incidents targeting minority communities following the change in power.Last week, a 25-year-old Hindu worker was lynched by a mob in Mymensingh city. On Monday, minority groups held protests in Dhaka over what they described as the interim government’s failure to prevent persecution of minorities.Hasina said she hoped Christmas would strengthen bonds of harmony and goodwill between Christians and followers of other religions in Bangladesh.“On this festive occasion of Christmas, I wish all Christian brothers and sisters happiness, peace, and prosperity,” she said.“May darkness give way to dawn. May Bangladesh live forever,” she added.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman landed in Dhaka on Thursday, ending more than 17 years of self-exile in the United Kingdom, amid renewed political uncertainty and unrest in the country.Rahman’s return comes in the aftermath of the killing of prominent youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who played a key role in the ouster of Sheikh Hasina. BNP Standing Committee members received Rahman at the airport, where he arrived with his wife Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman.The 60-year-old son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who is unwell, has emerged as a leading contender for prime minister in the February general elections.The BNP emerged as a frontrunner in the changed political landscape following the toppling of the Awami League government during a student-led violent movement known as the July Uprising on August 5, 2024.The interim government later disbanded the Awami League under the Anti-Terrorism Act through an executive order, leaving Jamaat-e-Islami and its Islamist allies, once BNP’s partners during the 2001-2006 tenure, as its main rivals.Rahman’s return has also assumed significance amid Jamaat’s efforts to expand its influence in Bangladesh’s fractured political landscape.The BNP had announced Rahman’s return on December 12, triggering speculation after he wrote in a Facebook post on November 29 that, “like any child,” he longed to be near his critically ill mother at her “moment of crisis”.","Sheikh hasina accuses interim government of perpetrating ""unspeakable atrocities"" against non-muslims.

Japan govt approves record 122 trillion yen budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/japan-govt-approves-record-122-trillion-yen-budget/articleshow/126182024.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)

The Japanese government on Friday approved a record budget for the upcoming fiscal year, to pay for everything from bigger defence spending to ballooning social security costs as inflation persists.The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget for the fiscal year from April 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi aims to accelerate Tokyo's sweeping upgrade of its military in the face of worsening relations with China.The defence ministry said in a briefing document that ""Japan faces the most severe and complex security environment since the end of the war,"" stressing the need to ""fundamentally strengthen"" its defence capabilities.At the core of its request is 100 billion yen for the so-called SHIELD coastal defence system, which would marshal drones to block any invasion by foreign troops.Japan is hoping that SHIELD -- Synchronised, Hybrid, Integrated and Enhanced Littoral Defence -- will be completed by March 2028, with no details yet on which part of Japan's coastline it will be linked to.The 122-trillion-yen figure compares with the 115 trillion yen sought for the current fiscal year to March, which was also a record.The expanding budget comes as the market worries about Takaichi's big spending policies adding to Japan's public debts.Japan already has the biggest ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) among major economies, projected to reach 232.7 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Earlier this month parliament approved a massive extra budget, to pay for a 21.3-trillion-yen stimulus announced a month earlier.The market has reacted by driving down the value of the yen while the benchmark yield rose for Japanese government bonds.Some observers have drawn comparisons to the UK's 2022 bond market turmoil under then-premier Liz Truss.Takaichi has advocated big government spending to spur economic growth.""What Japan needs right now is not the undermining of our strength as a nation through excessive austerity fiscal policies, but rather the bolstering of our national strength through proactive fiscal policies,"" she told a press conference last week.In an interview Tuesday with the influential Nikkei business daily, Takaichi stressed her commitment to Tokyo's fiscal health, rejecting any ""irresponsible bond issuance or tax cuts.""The current size of the budget is unlikely to shock the bond market, Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a note ahead of Friday.But an increase to around 125 trillion yen or more, he said, would cause the ""turmoil in the bond market, already in crisis mode, to deepen further"".Kiuchi noted that, under Takaichi, the extra budget quickly ballooned, reaching $18 trillion yen.""Financial markets are likely on high alert for a similar occurrence. Should the fall of the yen and bond prices further accelerate due to the size of the budget, it would increase worries about adverse effects on the economy and people's lives.""A weaker yen raises prices of imports for resource-poor Japan, which relies heavily on foreign food, energy and raw materials to power its economy.Takaichi came to power in October with a pledge to fight inflation after anger over rising prices. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population, caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. The draft budget needs to be approved by parliament.",The 122.3-trillion-yen ($782 billion) budget for the fiscal year from april 2026 will include some nine trillion yen for defence spending.

Candace Owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny







In the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination, fault lines inside the conservative movement have widened, and few voices have amplified that tension more than Candace Owens. The commentator has now turned her attention squarely toward Erika Kirk, challenging how the Turning Point USA figurehead has handled public scrutiny, internal dissent, and mounting conspiracy claims.What began as sympathy for a grieving widow has evolved into a broader argument about accountability, transparency, and leadership during moments of crisis. Owens’ remarks have sparked intense debate online, forcing conservatives to confront uncomfortable questions about power, responsibility, and credibility.Owens has said she agrees, in principle, that burial arrangements and family mourning should remain private. “I think that when people are being buried and where they're being buried and how their funerals are done, that is very private matter,” she acknowledged.But she drew a sharp line between privacy and selective engagement, accusing Erika of what she called “Meghan Markle syndrome ... where you want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn't work.”The controversy extends beyond personal boundaries. Owens expressed frustration that Erika claimed she lacked time to address conspiracy theories while continuing public appearances. “She has time,” Owens said. “It is just what she means to say: not her priority.”Erika, for her part, has defended her stance, stating, “Call me names, I don’t care. ... But when you go after my family, my Turning Point USA family, my [The] Charlie Kirk Show family… no.” She also emphasized her focus on accountability, saying, “I want justice for my husband.”Owens closed with a broader critique that ignited backlash: “this is why there are many people who do not believe that women are equipped to lead companies,” arguing the response she observed was “an unbelievably emotional response that is absent of any logic.”The exchange has become more than a personal feud, it now represents a defining moment for Turning Point USA and the movement surrounding it.Also Read: “She’s a sociopath”: Candace Owens faces growing credibility backlash as critics question missing Egyptian planes evidence","Conservative commentator candace owens argues grief does not exempt leadership from scrutiny.

Sean “Diddy” Combs’ appeal, Judge Arun Subramanian criticism, and Perez Hilton’s response explained





Perez Hilton has spoken out after Sean “Diddy” Combs filed a new appeal asking for his immediate release from prison. The reaction came after Combs’ legal team sharply criticized Arun Subramanian, who sentenced the rapper earlier this year.Combs is currently serving a 50-month prison sentence after being convicted on two federal charges tied to transportation for prostitution. His lawyers argue the sentence was unfair and claim the judge relied on claims the jury did not accept. A December 24 report by Rolling Stone revealed that the appeal seeks either Combs’ release or a full resentencing.Perez Hilton reacted strongly to the filing and suggested that Combs’ team is doing everything possible to shorten his time behind bars. The appeal now puts the case back in the spotlight, months after the high-profile trial ended.Sean “Diddy” Combs was arrested in September 2024 on several serious charges, including racketeering and prostitution-related offenses. After months of court hearings, a federal jury convicted him on July 2, 2025, on two counts of transportation for prostitution. He was cleared of other charges.On October 3, 2025, Judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Combs to 50 months in prison, five years of probation, and a $50,000 fine.Time already spent in jail was counted toward the sentence, setting his expected release date at May 8, 2028.A few days after sentencing, Combs’ legal team filed an appeal. According to Rolling Stone, the filing asks the appeals court to throw out the sentence and order his immediate release or send the case back for resentencing.Reacting on his website , Perez Hilton wrote:“Diddy’s legal team is still determined to get him out of jail ASAP, even going as far as to now point fingers at the judge!”Hilton also shared his view on what could happen next, saying:“Federal prosecutors have a couple of months to respond before the case can go before the appellate court, but they likely won’t let him get away with this latest attempt to go free.”The appeal was filed by appellate lawyer Alexandra A.E. Shapiro. The defense claims Judge Subramanian acted like a “thirteenth juror” and relied on testimony from women, including Cassie Ventura, even though the jury rejected related claims.A member of Combs’ legal team told Rolling Stone:“The appeal argues that the district court imposed a record-setting sentence by relying on conduct the jury explicitly rejected, in direct conflict with the 2024 Sentencing Guidelines and core constitutional principles.”The filing also states:“The court insisted it needed to impose a ‘serious sentence’ reflecting the ‘aggravating factors,’ especially ‘the coercion.’”During the trial, Combs’ defense team had asked for a sentence of just 14 months.Also Read: Candace Owens Faces Pushback As Alex Jones Questions Her Charlie Kirk Claims After Laura Loomer Talks",Perez hilton speaks out after diddy’s appeal attacks judge arun subramanian over prison sentence.

What the poll reveals about Trump and Powell



Trump trails despite strong Republican support



A long-running clash



Rates, policy and public moments





Jerome Powell has emerged as the most popular figure among senior US leaders, according to a new national survey. The finding places him ahead of President Donald Trump , whose approval rating remains near historic lows.The results come from a Gallup national poll conducted in early December 2025. The survey was carried out between December 1 and 15 and included roughly 1,000 US adults. It measured job approval for 13 major political and institutional figures.Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey. Trump’s approval rating stood at 36%, which Gallup described as a new low for his second term and only slightly above his all-time low of 34% recorded in 2021.Only two figures crossed the 40% threshold. Powell ranked first, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who registered a 41% approval rating. All other leaders included in the poll remained below that level.The survey shows that Trump’s approval remains sharply polarised along partisan lines. About 89% of Republicans approve of his performance, while support among independents is far lower and approval among Democrats is near zero.This divide continues to pull the president’s overall rating into the mid-30s.Powell’s numbers also reflect partisan division. While his 44% approval does not represent majority support, it remains the strongest net rating among all the figures tested in the poll.The result is notable given Trump’s repeated and public attacks on Powell throughout 2025. The president has criticised the Fed chair over interest-rate policy, called him a “loser,” and pressed the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to support economic growth.Trump has also suggested that Powell should resign and has openly weighed replacing him when his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, despite having nominated Powell to the position during his first term.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as it seeks to support a slowing economy. The most recent cut, announced in December, lowered the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Tensions between the two men have also played out publicly. In July, Powell corrected Trump during a visit to the Federal Reserve after the president misstated renovation costs at the Fed’s headquarters, an exchange that drew widespread attention.Gallup noted that no leader in the survey approached 50% approval, highlighting a broader mood of dissatisfaction with national leadership. The poll measures job approval rather than personal favourability or voting intent and reflects deep partisan divides across nearly all figures tested.","Gallup found that powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"Charlie Kirk's KILLER In Court; Tyler Robinson Defiant, Shows No Remorse | Dramatic Scenes On Cam





Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian dave chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator charlie kirk and civil rights icon martin luther king jr.

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities. This consistent ""watchful eye"" is part of the UAE's commitment to aligning with international standards set by global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to ensure that all exchange houses, their owners, and their staff strictly abide by UAE laws.This isn't just about punishment; it’s about prevention. By maintaining a transparent and high-standard environment, the UAE ensures that its financial system remains one of the most stable and secure in the world for residents and investors alike","Cbuae cancels licence of omda exchange in major enforcement move.
