Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Kural 667

Judge not by stature; It is the small

Linchpin that keeps the great chariot moving.

“They also serve who only stand and wait.”

India has never witnessed a travel crisis like the one that engulfed IndiGo recently. Lakhs of passengers were stranded. Airports became impatient seas of distress.A newlywed couple, still radiant from their vows, begged for a way to reach their own reception while guests waited elsewhere. A grieving wife stood by her husband’s coffin. Transit passengers wandered aimlessly, their connecting flights cancelled, their luggage lost somewhere in the airport’s labyrinth.I was at an airport on Dec 5. I was fortunate — I hadn’t checked in my luggage and returned home. But even leaving the airport was an ordeal. For more than two hours, I walked through a suffocating tide of fear, anger and confusion. Rage rose in me too — at those responsible for this collapse, none of whom were present.Passengers have every right to expect reliability and accountability. But amidst the justified outrage,- counter agents, duty managers, ground staff, cabin crews — stood for hours absorbing wave after wave of human ire. Some passengers grew abusive, shouting obscenities even at women staff. Videos showed people climbing over counters to scream at employees who had no authority to fix what had broken.Crises always expose the invisible backbone of organisations. During the 2008 Taj attack, some employees protected guests with extraordinary courage. IThat is why what I saw on the 5th was both heartbreaking and humbling. These employees were not just performing tasks; they were holding the emotional weight of thousands. Their leaders had failed them, but they still tried to do the next best thing, remaining calm in the middle of the storm.Thiruvalluvar knew the worth of such unseen strength.In, he writes:Uruvukandu Ellamai Vendum UlrulperumtherkkuAchchani Annaar Udaiththu.While this couplet emphasises that looks do not matter, it also talks about one’s stature in any hierarchy. Valluvar reminds us that greatness often rests on the smallest, quietest contributions. The lynchpin is not ornate, not celebrated, not even noticed. But remove it — and the entire chariot collapses.Is that not what we witnessed?Every time I walk through an airport, I see one lone staff member posted near each escalator. Their job is simply to stand there — not sit — through the entire shift, just in case someone needs help. They go unnoticed, but they are the first to respond when something goes wrong.I think of the watchmen in our buildings, who keep vigil while we sleep. The lineman who climbs an electric pole in the rain, so our homes stay lit. The ‘akka’ who clears tables in a crowded restaurant, unseen by those she serves.Their work is not glamorous. Their names may never be known. But they are the ones who keep life moving in quiet continuity. The grand chariots of our modern world do not move because of the one seated on the throne but because of the humble linchpins. John Milton captured this truth beautifully:","Bharathi bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

Can check airfares but deregulation must for growth: Naidu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-check-airfares-but-deregulation-must-for-growth-naidu/articleshow/125942594.cms,"'Real-Term Rise In Air Ticket Prices Negative'

NEW DELHI: Amid demands to regulate airfare, civil aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said in Lok Sabha on Friday that the govt retains the power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances - as seen during the recent spike in ticket prices due to mass-cancellation of IndiGo flights -to protect passengers against opportunistic pricing but emphasised the importance of deregulation and viability of airlines for the sector to grow.Rejecting criticism of soaring air prices, he said in real terms the growth in airfare is actually negative if consumer price index is factored in. In India, it has fallen by 43% compared to 23% in the US and 34% in China, he said, insisting that it is obvious that a certain pricing level has been maintained to keep it affordable for people.""We all feel these are companies which are charging a lot of money. But none of them are making good money. Most of them are in losses. We have to keep this in mind,"" he said, replying to a debate on a private member's resolution on ""appropriate measures to regulate airfare in the country"".Hitting back at opposition members who targeted the govt over instances of exorbitant airfares and the alleged duopoly in the sector, he said no matter how much politics they resort to, the governing alliance is committed to people and ensuring that more and more places are brought on the aviation map.If this was not the case, PM Narendra Modi would not have been elected to office three times in a row, Naidu asserted. He emphasised that deregulation in the sector since 1994 had led to its growth as more airlines joined in and competition rose to the benefits of passengers. Competition Commission of India and courts have also advocated deregulation, he said.Congress MP Shafi Parambil, who had moved the resolution, cited the airfare of over Rs 60,000 in a Srinagar to Delhi flight following the Pahalgam terror attack to bat for regulation but withdrew his resolution as per the standard convention in cases of private members' business.Naidu noted that the govt has a tariff monitoring unit, which is being made more powerful by its inclusion in aircraft rules to lend it statutory provisions. He said the govt had intervened to cap prices for air tickets to Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh this year, and it had taken similar measures after the Pahalgam terror attack.It is not that price surge occurs every day but mostly during festive seasons, he said, stressing that the govt has sat with airlines to augment capacities in specific routes during such occurrences.Aircraft availability is one of the constraints for the sector, and the govt is working at a programme so that aircraft are manufactured in India and the country grows as a leasing hub like Ireland and Singapore, he added.","Civil aviation minister k rammohan naidu says govt retains power to intervene in extraordinary circumstances.

DGCA removes 4 officials overseeing IndiGo ops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-removes-4-officials-overseeing-indigo-ops/articleshow/125942505.cms,"'Failed To Flag Crew Shortfall Under New Rules'

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

Management faced growing rift with IndiGo pilots: Official

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed from their positions four flight operations inspectors (FOIs) who were the principal operations inspectors (POI) for oversight on IndiGo Designated specifically for an airline, these FOIs (senior pilots) are supposed to keep a close watch on the airline's requirements and also see if they have the required resources in terms of crew for their operations. Airline pilots go as FOIs to the short-staffed DGCA for some years. In this case, the four have been sent back to their airline before their term got over.In IndiGo's case, officials said, despite new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) or crew rostering rules scheduled to come into effect from July 1, 2025, and then Nov 1, which would have increased pilot requirement, the airline did not hire for the same. The FOIs failed to flag the issue, they said.This led to a shortage, with IndiGo unable to operate as per new FDTL, which was then put on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft till Feb 10, 2026, to avoid the sort of mass cancellations seen earlier this month.""IndiGo was in discussion with DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots,"" said an official in the know.Even after the fiasco, IndiGo maintains there is no pilot shortage.DGCA has directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring. Meanwhile, IndiGo's operations are nearly back to normal, with over 2,050 flights Friday across 138 destinations.There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management. The operations control centre (OCC) of the airline is severely disliked by IndiGo pilots. An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing night flights. New contract had capped flying. A number of things happened that only widened the gulf between pilots and management,"" an official said.The discontent in IndiGo pilots has arisen not merely for deferring FDTL implementation, but also on other fronts like tweaking salary components, medically unfit and sick report policy. Things got worse recently when some Indian carriers wanted restriction on their pilots going abroad to work for foreign airlines, mainly in the Gulf.""It is okay for Indian carriers to hire expat top management people like CEOs and COOs but they have a problem with us going abroad to work. If you want to retain us, then have better relations with employees, better work environment and pay package. Instead, airlines only want to arm-twist us. Maybe things will change now after the IndiGo fiasco,"" added a pilot.","'failed to flag crew shortfall under new rules' under new rules, indigo did not hire for the same.

Why India’s New Right To Disconnect Bill Could Transform Work Culture, Protect Millions From Burnout

Key provisions of the bill

Global pioneers in disconnection rights

France leads with early legislation

Portugal enforces strict boundaries

Italy adapts to flexible work

Australia joins the movement

US lacks legal protections amid rising proposals

India's parliament has seen the introduction of a new bill that grants employees the power to ignore work communications outside official hours. The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life. Employees gain the legal right to switch off from calls, emails, and messages without fear of repercussions from employers.Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule introduced this private member's bill in the Lok Sabha. As a non-ministerial proposal, it focuses on creating an Employees' Welfare Authority to oversee implementation and address violations.The legislation mandates that companies establish clear policies on after-hours contact. Workers can decline responses to non-emergency communications, promoting healthier work-life balance. The proposed authority would investigate complaints, impose fines on non-compliant firms, and educate both sides on rights and responsibilities. Supriya Sule's bill applies to private sector employees, ensuring they disconnect without disciplinary action.Several nations adopted similar measures years before India's proposal.These laws emerged amid rising concerns over burnout and digital overload in modern workplaces. Governments recognised the need to protect workers from incessant demands.France became a trailblazer in 2017 by enacting the Right to Disconnect as part of the El Khomri Labour Law, requiring companies—especially larger ones—to negotiate with unions to ensure employees are not pressured to be online after hours, helping combat digital burnout and protect work-life balance. The law requires firms with over 50 employees to negotiate agreements on out-of-hours communications. Workers disconnect from devices, and employers respect rest periods. This stemmed from labour code reforms addressing 35-hour workweeks and overtime boundaries.Portugal introduced robust protections in 2021 (Law no. 83/2021). Employers face bans on contacting staff outside shifts, with fines up to €9,690 for violations. The law covers remote workers, mandating compensation for home office expenses. It prohibits monitoring tools that invade privacy during off-hours.Italy embedded the right in 2017 smart working laws (Law 81/2017). Companies must outline disconnection periods in contracts for remote employees. Unions negotiate terms, ensuring no penalties for unavailability. This applies to public and private sectors, focusing on work-life harmony.Australia implemented its version in 2024. Employees ignore unreasonable after-hours contacts, with tribunals resolving disputes. Small businesses get exemptions initially, but larger firms comply fully. The law builds on fair work acts, shielding staff from overreach.The United States trails far behind, with no federal, state, or local right to disconnect laws enacted as of December 2025. California led the charge in February 2024 with Assembly Bill 2751, mandating policies for ignoring employer communications during non-working hours, defined by job descriptions or agreements. The measure stalled in committee amid pushback from businesses citing global operations and flexibility needs, though it could resurface. New Jersey followed with a similar 2024 bill for firms with 10-plus staff, but it too faltered. Earlier attempts in New York City and Washington met defeat, leaving workers reliant on voluntary policies.This void amplifies US work culture's intensity. Over 80% of employees report job-related stress, with more than half saying it spills into home life, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Salaried roles often exceed 40 hours without overtime pay, fostering a ""hustle"" mentality where unplugging invites guilt. Tech firms like Google offer perks such as flexible schedules and mental health days, but these vary widely, and many sectors demand round-the-clock responsiveness.","The right to disconnect bill, 2025, targets the constant connectivity that blurs boundaries between professional and personal life.

Inside The Buzz In Washington

Does it fit Trump's plan?



NEW DELHI: Only a few months back, Donald Trump had said that the US had lost India and Russia to the ""deepest darkest China"". Now, reports indicate he wants the States to join a new grouping with those very countries, and even bring Japan into it. However, no official confirmation has been made regarding this so far.An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5” bloc that would include China and Russia, bringing long-time rivals into the same framework and offering a clear contrast to the G7, Politico reported.""Nothing around a C5 or C7 was discussed, but there were certainly conversations that the existing bodies like the G-structures or the UN Security Council weren’t fit for purpose given today’s new players,"" the news outlet quoted a White House official who worked in the previous Trump administration saying.The report suggested the proposal for this group appeared in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy, referenced by Defense One, though this version couldn’t be independently confirmed by NatSec Daily. The White House firmly rejected the claim, with spokesperson Anna Kelly stating that no alternate, private, or classified version of the 33-page official strategy exists.Though such a plan once seemed unlikely, some observers say it fits Trump’s style.As the US president, he has often sought deals with rival nations, approving the sale of Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to China and sending envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""This aligns with how we know President Trump to view the world, which is non ideologically, through an affinity for strongmen, and through a propensity of working with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,"" Politico quoted former director for European affairs on the National Security Council Torrey Taussig saying.The buzz comes at after Trump raised the tariff tensions, especially with the three nations — India, China and Russia, over trade disagreements and Ukraine war.It's not long back when he had posted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping saying: ""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!""The tensions seem to be easing out, but with a deadlock, as India and US are making efforts to finalise a bilateral trade deal.Moreover, PM Modi had a telephonic conversation with Trump on Thursday and the two reviewed ""bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments.""""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi posted on X.","Is trump planning a new core-5 superclub with india as central power?

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing concerns over the exponential rise in airfares due to the IndiGo crisis, aviation minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu on Friday said that the prices of flight tickets are on par with the rest of the world and that the government has taken steps to bring down prices during extraordinary times.While speaking in the Lok Sabha, the civil aviation minister said that even though the aviation sector is deregulated, the government observes the necessity to interfere and use its powers to cap fares while keeping market deregulation intact.""The whole idea of open sky is there to keep the competition alive. Whenever it is necessary to interfere, the government has used its power. Recently, we saw during the IndiGo crisis that there were many cancellations, many routes where the airline was not able to operate due to which there was a capacity constraint,"" Naidu said.""It was observed that if we didn’t interfere, there could be a rise in airfares. So immediately we stepped in, released an order and, this time, we made categories based on distance and clearly communicated to the airlines that there has to be a capping in airfares,"" he added.This comes days after the government imposed airfare caps, for the first time after Covid pandemic, as the IndiGo crisis had led to airfares surging exponentially.The aviation ministry said that it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and that it has “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”These caps will remain in force until IndiGo operations are back to pre-crisis levels.Under the new cap, airlines cannot charge more than:The ministry clarified that these limits exclude applicable UDF, PSF and taxes, and will not apply to Business Class or RCS-UDAN flights.","Civil aviation minister kinjarapu ram mohan naidu says the government has taken steps to bring down prices during extraordinary times.

Amid Flight Meltdown, IndiGo Chairman Denies Claims of Rule Manipulation and Crisis Engineering

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Friday appointed an external aviation specialist to investigate the ""root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption,"" the airline’s Board said in a statement.The decision follows the recommendation of the Crisis Management Group (CMG) set up by the IndiGo Board shortly after the operational disruptions began in the first week of December.""Captain Illson brings over four decades of aviation experience spanning the FAA, ICAO, IATA, and major global carriers. With an illustrious career in international air transport, he offers deep expertise in aviation strategy, customised consulting, safety leadership, setting global standards, and new aircraft technologies,"" the statement said. The expert is expected to begin work immediately and submit a comprehensive report to the Board.""The objective is to conduct an independent root cause analysis of the recent operational disruption, besides opportunities for improvement,"" the airline added.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is further examining whether IndiGo violated competition norms, reported PTI, citing a senior official.The decision comes after IndiGo’s operations nearly collapsed last week due to non-compliance with new crew duty norms.Earlier today, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) also dismissed four flight operations inspectors who were responsible for monitoring the airline.The issues for the airline stemmed from the airline’s failure to hire additional pilots despite knowing that new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules, affecting crew rostering, were due to take effect on July 1, later revised to November 1. The revised norms would have required more pilots, but IndiGo did not expand its pilot pool. As a result, the DGCA had to put the new FDTL on hold for Airbus A320 aircraft until February 10, 2026, to avoid widespread cancellations like those seen earlier this month.“IndiGo was in discussion with the DGCA on the new FDTL and was aware of the increased pilot requirement. Yet they did not hire pilots. What has happened is inevitable,” said people in the know. Even after the operational crisis, IndiGo has maintained that there is no shortage of pilots. The DGCA has now directed the airline to step up its pilot hiring.The situation has also highlighted internal strains within the airline. “There is a complete disconnect and mistrust between the pilots and the management.

An extra payment was made for night landings which was stopped for a while and so pilots started refusing the same. New contract capped flying.

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of indians on h-1b visas, along with their h-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in india.

Single higher education regulator closer as Cabinet okays Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-higher-education-regulator-closer-as-cabinet-okays-viksit-bharat-shiksha-adhikshan-bill/articleshow/125935312.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Friday cleared the proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill, paving the way for a major overhaul of higher education regulation and giving legislative shape to a key commitment of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education, replacing legacy regulators such as the University Grants Commission (UGC), the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE). Medical and legal education will remain outside its ambit, it is learnt. The Bill is likely to be placed before the Parliament in the current session.The proposed legislation, earlier referred to as the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) Bill, has now been given Viksit Bharat branding, aligning it with the government’s broader reform narrative. Officials said the new framework ""is aimed at simplifying governance, reducing regulatory overlap and shifting the focus of oversight away from compliance-driven controls towards academic quality and learning outcomes across public and private institutions.Under the proposed law, higher education governance will be reorganised through a clear separation of functions. Regulation, accreditation, academic standard-setting and funding will be handled through distinct verticals, ending the long-standing concentration of multiple powers within a single body.While the new authority will frame norms, quality benchmarks and institutional oversight mechanisms, the disbursal of public funds will continue to rest with the administrative ministry. ""The separation is intended to prevent conflicts of interest, reduce micromanagement and create a more transparent regulatory architecture,"" said an official with the ministry of education.The idea of a unified higher education regulator predates NEP 2020. In 2018, a draft bill proposing the repeal of the UGC Act and the creation of the HECI was placed in the public domain for stakeholder consultation. That proposal, however, triggered concerns within the academic community over excessive centralisation and the possible erosion of university autonomy, and it did not move forward. The NEP 2020 revived the concept in a more calibrated form, arguing that India’s higher education regulatory structure had become fragmented, inconsistent and overly prescriptive. The policy document called for a “complete overhaul” of the system and stressed that regulation, accreditation, funding and academic standard-setting should be performed by independent and empowered bodies. Renewed efforts to translate this vision into legislation gathered pace after Dharmendra Pradhan took charge as education minister in 2021.Supporters of the new bill argue that it addresses long-standing governance distortions in the sector. Multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions have often resulted in contradictory rules, delayed approvals and compliance-heavy institutional behaviour. ""A unified regulator could bring coherence to academic standards, ensure uniform quality benchmarks and allow universities greater freedom to innovate in curricula, pedagogy and research, while remaining accountable for outcomes,"" said professor Vinay Pathak, vice chancellor, Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University, formerly Kanpur University.The emphasis on accreditation and learning outcomes, rather than inspections and permissions, is seen as a structural shift aligned with global best practices. By ring-fencing funding from regulatory decision-making, the government aims to create a system where quality assurance is insulated from financial considerations, encouraging institutions to compete on academic merit rather than procedural compliance.At the same time, policy analysts note that the effectiveness of the reform will depend heavily on implementation. ""The composition, independence and transparency of the new authority, and the manner in which its verticals interact with state governments and universities, will be closely watched. Issues related to institutional autonomy, federal balance and the transition from existing regulators are expected to figure prominently when the bill is taken up in Parliament.The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhikshan Bill could mark a decisive shift in how higher education is governed in India, moving from a fragmented, rule-bound system to one that places governance reform and education quality at the centre.","Proposed law seeks to establish a single overarching authority for higher education.

This aims to boost domestic energy production and meet net-zero targets.

PM Modi Announces Major Move Allowing Private Players Into Nuclear Sector To Spur Advanced Reactors

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Friday approved a bill that seeks to open the highly restricted nuclear power sector to private companies and is also crucial for the country's goal of achieving 100 gigawatt nuclear power capacity by 2047.Officials said Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill proposes amending the civil liability law to shield plant operators and cap equipment suppliers' liability, along with redesigning operator insurance to Rs 1,500 crore per incident under Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool.The bill proposes allowing up to 49% foreign direct investment and creating a unified legal framework for atomic energy, including a specialised nuclear tribunal.Private-sector entry will be governed by clear rules under govt oversight, while department of atomic energy will retain control over core functions such as nuclear material production, heavy water, and waste management.FM Nirmala Sitharaman had announced govt's intent to open the sector to private participation in her Feb Budget speech. She had also unveiled a Nuclear Energy Mission with Rs 20,000 crore for R&D on small modular reactors (SMRs), and a plan to operationalise five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033. PM Narendra Modi indicated last month that govt was preparing to open the nuclear sector to private players.Atomic Energy Act bars private entities and state govts from operating nuclear power plants.Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, a PSU under DAE, is the sole operator and runs all 24 commercial reactors.Officials said SHANTI bill aimed to address long-standing concerns across the nuclear energy chain. They pointed to rising domestic energy demand, growth of data centres, and India's 2070 net-zero target as factors driving ren-ewed global interest in nuclear power. Officials added scaling nuclear capacity ten-fold in two decades will require private-sector involvement.Anujesh Dwivedi, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""Tariff for nuclear power is governed by the department of atomic energy, in consultation with the central electricity authority. Private sector participation will necessitate governance by an independent regulator, enabling competitive determination of tariffs.""""Involving the private sector in R&D of nuclear technologies for civil use by allowing creation of intellectual property rights would be in line with the approach of several developed countries,"" he added.","The union cabinet has greenlit a bill to open india's nuclear power sector to private players.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","Pm narendra modi and president donald trump spoke on thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

Erika Kirk tells Fox News she wants “one thing” kept private as Candace Owens links message to herself







Candace Owens reacted fast after Erika Kirk went on Fox News and asked people to stop searching for the secret place where her husband Charlie Kirk is buried. Erika Kirk told the public she wanted “one thing” left private for her family. But soon after, Candace Owens posted a video saying Erika Kirk’s words were really pointed at her. Candace Owens said in her new clip, “Super fun show today. You’re probably seeing the clips … it’s about me. It’s indirect, but it’s also about me. And don’t worry, in case you think it’s not about me, she is going to name check me on stage.”This reaction came as many conspiracy theories continue to grow around Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. His body’s location has never been shared. This has only made more people online push strange theories, something Erika Kirk finally addressed on TV.When Erika Kirk sat with host Harris Faulkner on Fox News, she looked tired and upset as she spoke about the rumors. Harris Faulkner asked her, “Talk to me about this part of the conspiracies that are out there.This disturbing part that people are trying to guess where Charlie is.”Erika Kirk answered with strong emotion:“Can I have one thing? Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at Turning Point USA… But can I have one thing? Can my babies have one thing where we hold it sacred?”She also said she feared someone might try to damage Charlie’s grave.“Where my husband is laid to rest, where I don’t have to be worried about some secular revolutionary coming and destroying my husband’s grave while my daughter is sitting there praying. One thing. This is my husband.”Soon after Charlie Kirk’s death, Erika Kirk received money from life insurance and public donations.While Erika Kirk asked for privacy, Candace Owens continued to question the official story of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has pushed many unproven ideas, saying the killing was a “hit” and claiming she got secret “military” tips from a source.Also Read: “Some Ignorant Black…”: Nick Fuentes Warns He Will Expose Candace Owens If TPUSA Livestream On Charlie Kirk Fails",Candace owens fires back hard as erika kirk asks the public to end charlie kirk conspiracy stories.

Why the Sherrone Moore firing created the perfect storm for the Paige Shiver pregnancy rumor

What is confirmed about Paige Shiver and why her name is repeating in every Sherrone Moore conversation

Is Paige Shiver pregnant is the question sitting at the top of every search bar now that the Sherrone Moore story has turned into a full public meltdown. Michigan fired Sherrone Moore for cause, police detained him hours later, and the university confirmed only one concrete detail. There was an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The school did not name the staffer. Law enforcement did not name the staffer. Yet Paige Shiver has been pushed into the center of the scandal by social media detectives who filled in the gaps with their own theories.The rumor grew even louder once Shiver deleted or hid her social media accounts. That timing alone was enough for people to assume something explosive had happened. None of the pregnancy claims have been confirmed by the university, law enforcement, or any official source. They remain unverified speculation attached to a real firing and a real police detention.Michigan cut Sherrone Moore with immediate effect after internal investigators said they found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Athletic director Warde Manuel’s statement was clear and direct.“U M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of university policy, and U M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” he said.That was the official foundation. Everything after that came from outside the university.A few hours after his termination, officers in Saline, Michigan detained Sherrone Moore during a domestic incident at an apartment. The Pittsfield Township Police Department took over the investigation. ESPN’s Dan Wetzel reported the development on X, stating that authorities located and detained Moore for potential charges. Police have said the incident was not random. Reports from Michigan have also noted that Moore threatened to harm himself during the encounter. The investigation is ongoing and the exact charges remain unknown.The timing, the firing for cause, the police involvement, and the sudden vacuum around the unnamed staffer created an open space online. Users decided to choose their own protagonist. That is how the theory about Paige Shiver began.Shiver joined Michigan in 2022 in on campus recruiting and operations. She became the executive assistant to the head coach in 2024. That role places her physically and professionally close to the head coach at all times. Combine that proximity with the fact that the university did not release a name and you have a recipe for internet assignment.The rumor escalated when users noticed that she set her Instagram to private and deactivated her LinkedIn and X accounts. Marca reported that her Facebook page now shows only her profile and cover image. People interpreted the move as confirmation. In reality, any employee who becomes the target of unverified allegations often shuts down digital profiles to avoid harassment.The pregnancy claim grew out of posts from large commentary accounts on X that have no official sourcing. These accounts circulated messages, screenshots, and unverified claims that spread quickly. None of the claims about pregnancy appear in any official document, press release, police report, or university statement. They remain social media theories with no confirmation.Meanwhile, everything officially tied to the firing stays the same. The university confirmed an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The staff member has not been identified. The rumor that the staff member is Paige Shiver and that she is pregnant is not supported by any confirmed evidence.Away from the sidelines and the pressure of Michigan football, Moore is simply a father of three. He and his wife, Kelli, share daughters Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie, who have long been described by people around the family as the center of his world. Moore rarely speaks publicly about them, but he has often hinted that they are the foundation of his life outside coaching.Social media has turned the Moore scandal into a frenzy, and one of the loudest claims is that Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore may have known each other beyond the workplace. Nothing has been confirmed, but the idea of his alleged mistress being friendly with his wife is adding a sharper edge to already wild pregnancy rumors and online speculation.The confirmed information about her is simple and factual. According to Larry Brown Sports and the Michigan athletics website, Shiver joined the Wolverines in 2022 and moved into the executive assistant position in 2024. She has worked in operations, recruitment support, and administrative planning. She is the daughter of longtime Chicago Bears scout Jeff Shiver. She is also a Purdue graduate who was profiled by the Bears in 2016 for her experience living with Pompe Disease.None of these details link her directly to the inappropriate relationship that resulted in Moore’s firing. None link her to the police detention. None confirm any pregnancy rumor.What is not confirmed is whether the staff member involved is Paige Shiver. What is not confirmed is whether she was pregnant. None of this appears in official records. None of it has been acknowledged by the university or the police.Per AP, Sherrone Moore is set to be arraigned Thursday afternoon, barely a day after he was fired for what the university called an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and later arrested just south of Michigan Stadium. Court records show he is still in the custody of the Washtenaw County Jail, which has not released details about the reason for his detention or his bond status.Sherrone Moore’s firing has now pulled in a second wave of controversy after OnlyFans creator Mia Sorety claimed the former Michigan coach sent her flirty DMs while married. Her allegations surfaced as unverified online rumors continued to link staffer Paige Shiver to Moore’s misconduct case, adding to the scrutiny around his online behavior and personal life, though none of these claims have been officially confirmed.Moore remains in custody in Washtenaw County as he awaits an expected arraignment Friday, though no charges have been filed so far. Police have confirmed they are investigating an alleged incident tied to his detention, but court officials say paperwork has not yet been submitted, leaving the case in limbo as the fallout from his firing continues.","Paige shiver’s name has been pulled into the sherrone moore scandal amid unverified pregnancy rumors.

Haeley’s goodbye message reveals the moments that made New York feel like home for the Alonsos



Pete Alonso’s free agency shift became one of the week’s biggest stories after the All-Star infielder signed a five year, 155 million deal with the Baltimore Orioles. His departure closed a long and lively chapter with the New York Mets, a team he grew up in as both a player and a person. The move also stirred deep feelings at home. Haeley Alonso shared a message that quietly captured the meaning of the years they spent in New York and how much the city shaped their life together.Her post did not read like a farewell to a fan base. It read like someone touching an old memory and realizing how full those years truly were. She chose a picture from his 2019 rookie season, a moment when everything felt new and uncertain. That image became the center of her reflection as she looked back on the start of their journey in baseball’s biggest market.Haeley wrote, ""I was looking back at pictures and videos last night of our past 7 years in New York to go down memory lane as we close out this chapter and enter a new one. As I was getting close to the beginning of my photos, I came across this picture I took of Pete after his debut game back in 2019. Admittedly, I burst into tears because it so vividly brought me back to that exact moment.Seeing him so dirty, so exhausted but it was the happiest I had ever seen him. ""Her words showed how clearly she remembers that night. It was not the stats or the noise in the stadium. It was the look on his face when he walked off the field, tired yet thrilled, stepping into a future neither of them could fully imagine then.She continued, ""We fell in love with New York City and lived in Manhattan for 6 years. We fell in love with the fans and their passion. Sometimes glowing, sometimes... spirited but always heartfelt. We loved this team. His teammates, coaches, staff... truly everyone. We made lifelong friends over the years and l'm forever grateful for that. Just so grateful for all of it Thank you for loving Pete.""Her message turned their exit into something gentle.

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role.
