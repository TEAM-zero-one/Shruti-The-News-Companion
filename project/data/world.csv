Kash Patel to be fired for Charlie Kirk probe blunders?

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Kash patel, the fbi director, made a series of wrong moves in the charlie kirk incident.

'I Didn't Do It': Pilot's Last Words Before Air India Crash| Probe Report| Tech Failure or Sabotage?

Poll Do you think the media has played a fair role in reporting on the crash? Yes, they have been unbiased. No, they have sensationalized the story.

NEW DELHI: The father of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, who died in the Air India Ahmedabad crash in June this year, has called for a 'formal investigation' by the central government while criticising the findings of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) as well as the ""selective leaks"" that ""tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation"".In the Ahmedabad plane crash, which was one of the worst aircraft accidents in India, 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed. Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after take off from Ahmedabad on June 12.In a letter to the civil aviation secretary and AAIB Director General, 91-year-old Pushkaraj Sabharwal said that selective leaks about the accident had led to speculation that Sumeet (56) was under tremendous psychological pressure and contemplating suicide, PTI reported.""These innuendos have very adversely affected my health and mental setup and the reputation of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal. They tarnish Captain Sabharwal's reputation, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to a citizen of India under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the letter, dated August 29, said.Pushkaraj has demanded that the central government order a formal enquiry into the accident under Rule 12 of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017, which empowers the Centre to institute a formal investigation into the circumstances of any accident of an Indian-registered aircraft if it appears expedient to hold such a probe.There were no immediate comments from the civil aviation ministry or the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the letter.Amid speculation about the cause of the fatal crash following the release of its preliminary probe report on July 12, the AAIB had asserted it was too early to draw any “definite conclusions” as the investigation was still on and that the final report would identify root causes. The agency also urged everyone to refrain from spreading premature narratives.""The preliminary report on the contrary does not allude to the 'what' happened or the bare facts of the crash, instead resorting to insinuations on the one hand and offering copious clean chits to the manufacturer/s on the other. The report in its present form is deficient, diversionary & discrepant,"" the letter said.It further alleged that selective information from the preliminary investigation — including contents of the cockpit voice recorder — had been put into the public domain.Pushkaraj also refuted speculation about his son’s mental health. Citing reports, he said it was suggested Sumeet was divorced and that caused him anxiety and depression.""It even ignores the fact that Captain Sabharwal was divorced about 15 years ago. The other speculation relating to the cause for Captain Sabharwal being desirous of committing suicide has been his mother's death. His mother died more than three years ago. After that, Captain Sabharwal had operated more than 100 flights without any incident or accident.""It is most pertinent to note that in over 25 years of flying, Captain Sabharwal had not had a single incident or accident-causing fatalities or otherwise,"" the letter said.He had almost 15,638.22 hours of flying experience, of which 8,596 hours were on the 787-8. He was also designated as a Pilot Trainer — a Line Training Captain — and held the DGCA licence for that purpose.Pushkaraj added that the absence of a formal enquiry under Rule 12, coupled with selective information being provided to the media, was very disturbing and detrimental to him and affected his fundamental rights, including the right to the reputation of his deceased son.In the preliminary report, AAIB had said the fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after takeoff. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,"" it had said.","Ahmedabad plane crash. 260 people, including 241 passengers, were killed.

Corps commanders were asked to accompany the janaza (funeral procession) and guard it in uniform,"" Ilyas purportedly says in a video that has emerged online.He went on to confirm the complicity of his boss Maulana Masood Azhar in terror attacks in India, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. ""After escaping from Tihar (post IC-814 hijack), Amir-ul-Mujahideen Maulana Masood Azhar came to Pakistan and the soil of Balakot provided him a base to carry forward his vision, mission, and programme in Delhi and Mumbai,"" he said.Another video surfaced on Wednesday, in which Lashkar-e-Taiba 's deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri - one of the masterminds of Apr 22 Pahalgam attack - warned India and the PM of consequences of their actions towards terrorist groups. In the video posted on Telegram, Kasuri at an event warned that there will be attempts to seize Indian dams, rivers, and territory in J&K.Kasuri went on to reveal that Pakistan govt and army are funding the terrorist organisation to rebuild its HQ in Muridke, which was destroyed during Operation Sindoor.""We're going through difficult times but our spirits are high. We are soft like silk for our people, but beyond imagination for our enemies... Our enemies should not assume we will lose our willpower or remain silent about these wounds, we will retaliate aggressively,"" Kasuri is heard saying even as he sought public support.""Whatever actions you (India) are taking, God willing... you will have to pay the price for each and every one of them. Whatever you are doing today, it will be avenged, and brick will be answered with stone. We will sacrifice our lives, and protect and defend every inch, every particle of our beloved homeland,"" he said.Kasuri's revelation directly implicates the Pakistan govt, which had earlier denied the presence of any army officer at a funeral for terrorists. Pakistan had come under fire in May when the photograph of army officers at the funeral had surfaced, leading to a furore.

US' Ex-NSA John Bolton: ‘Trump Should Call Modi, Fix Relations, And Visit India For QUAD Summit'

Former US national security advisor John Bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the US on India under President Donald Trump have complicated negotiations. He described the US tariff policy on India as a mistake and said the priority should be reaching a deal that lowers tariffs while keeping negotiations open.""I think the whole tariff policy is a mistake. I think we ought to go back to the way we were before, but leaving that aside, in the time of Trump, in the White House. To get a deal that reduces the tariffs and leaves the way open for further negotiations is the best thing to do,"" Bolton said in an interview with TOI.He added that the focus should be on finding common ground on economic tariffs and then building from there.Bolton criticized the 25 percent US tariffs on India as collateral damage from broader Western sanctions on Russia, which were imposed over Russian oil and gas imports. He called the move “incoherent”, noting that Russia faced no direct tariffs and China, which imports more oil and gas than India, was left unpenalized.He also noted that India’s historical ties with Russia present challenges but argued for a gradual transition toward cooperation with like-minded partners.“I think we need to reduce purchases of Russia and oil and gas, and there are ways to do this to help transition India away from that in a way that's economically sound,” he said.He suggested that both sides should resume talks to reduce tariffs and rebuild trust, emphasizing the importance of personal rapport between leaders in fostering cooperation.“If the two leaders are now closer to being able to talk about it again that I think is a good sign I hope indicates progress,” he said, adding that a conversation between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to happen.On broader geopolitical concerns, Bolton highlighted the significance of closer collaboration between India, the US, Japan, and Australia through the Quad, particularly in countering China-Russia strategic alignment.He also said that he doesn’t think that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.Bolton said Pakistan’s recent statement that Trump had no role in de-escalating tensions after the Kashmir attack highlights that the resolution was handled solely by India and Pakistan.""I think it's pretty remarkable that they would say that, and certainly, those who know a little bit about India know that from the similar agreements on forward, that's been the position that issues between Pakistan and India will be settled by the two of them. It's an example of how little Trump knows about,"" Bolton added.Bolton observed that Trump often seeks credit for international developments, citing the Nobel Peace Prize as a possible motivation.",Former us national security advisor john bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the us on india have complicated negotiations.

EU sets strategic agenda to boost India relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-sets-strategic-agenda-to-boost-india-relations/articleshow/123960134.cms,"'Will open a new chapter in ties'

NEW DELHI: Under pressure from the US to impose tariffs on India for its oil purchase from Russia, the European Union (EU) Wednesday rolled out a new strategic agenda for boosting bilateral cooperation with India, including through the creation of an EU-India Security and Defence Partnership that would also facilitate defence industrial collaboration, along with technology, maritime security and counterterrorism cooperation.Following the launch of EU's proposals for a comprehensive strategic agenda that will be adopted at the next India-EU summit, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen spoke to PM Modi to brief him about EU's vision for ties with India, while also wishing him on his birthday.Delighted to know about the 'New Strategic EU-India Agenda' adopted today (Wednesday). India is ready to take the India-EU relationship to the next level. It is our shared commitment, shared goal and shared responsibility. We remain committed to an early and peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict,"" said Modi in a post on X, lauding the agenda.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said India and the EU will open a new chapter in ties and that she discussed progress in trade talks and how they can work together to effectively support Ukraine's ""fight for freedom"".Both EU and India want to upgrade their 2004 strategic partnership with a new comprehensive agenda, as they look for ways to offset likely damages from President Donald Trump's tariff policy. While the leaders reiterated their commitment to have the free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of this year, there's still a lot of ground to be covered in the trade negotiations and differences over Russia continue to act as an impediment in ties.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stressed at the launch that India's oil procurement from Russia remained an issue, saying that ""ultimately, our partnership is not only about trade, but also about defending the rules-based international order. On the trade deal, Kallas warned that nothing is agreed till everything is agreed. EU officials, however, have ruled out tariffs or sanctions against India for its crude purchase from Russia.India and the EU held the 13th round of FTA negotiations here last week and another round is expected early next month in Brussels. However, EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, who visited India last week, said he had expected more progress in the last round of talks.As India encourages the EU to double down on defence and security cooperation and raise its profile in the Indo-Pacific, the EU also announced that that the two sides are launching negotiations on a Security of Information Agreement that will facilitate the exchange of classified information and stronger cooperation in areas related to security and defence.""This could also pave the way for India's participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks,"" said the EU in its joint communication on the agenda.There was also a mention of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in the agenda with the EU calling it a tragic reminder of terrorism's human cost and committing to further strengthening counterterrorism cooperation to assess global threats, counter extremism and terrorism financing.","'will open a new chapter in ties' says european commission president ursula von der leyen.

Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has been pulled from ABC’s schedule after the host came under fire for remarks about the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk . The network confirmed the decision on Wednesday, saying the programme would be “pre-empted indefinitely.” The move followed an announcement from Nexstar Media Group, which oversees dozens of ABC affiliates, that it would stop broadcasting the show in response to Kimmel’s comments.“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division. ABC confirmed the move, saying the show would be “pre-empted indefinitely.”Trump celebrated ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live, calling it “Great News for America.” In a Truth Social post, Trump mocked Kimmel as “ratings challenged” and having “ZERO talent,” while praising ABC for “finally having the courage to do what had to be done.” He added, “That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC… Do it NBC!!!”Trump also pointed out Kimmel’s low ratings, saying they were “worse than even Colbert, if that’s possible.”During his Monday night monologue, Kimmel said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” The comments sparked immediate backlash, with critics accusing Kimmel of insensitivity.Kirk, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead last week during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Authorities said 22-year-old Tyler Robinson fired a rifle from a rooftop, killing Kirk with a single shot to the neck. Robinson has been charged with murder.Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr also condemned the remarks, calling them “some of the sickest conduct possible” in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. He suggested the FCC could consider taking action against ABC affiliates, warning that broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.” Carr said a suspension or even firing of Kimmel could be necessary, adding that “a public apology would be a very reasonable, minimal step. ”The White House also weighed in, with its social media account celebrating the suspension, saying: “They’re doing their viewers a favour. Jimmy is a sick freak.” Kimmel has long been a vocal critic of Trump, often using his late-night platform to target the former president and his supporters.Disney and ABC have not provided further details about the suspension, and Kimmel’s spokesperson has not responded to requests for comment. The move mirrors the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s show on CBS, which the network insisted was for financial reasons, though critics linked it to his repeated attacks on Trump.","Kimmel came under fire for remarks about the murder of conservative commentator charlie kirk.
