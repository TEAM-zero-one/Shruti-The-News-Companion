Second meeting between EAM, Rubio in 2 months

NEW DELHI: EAM S Jaishankar met his US counterpart Marco Rubio in Malaysia amid efforts to repair the India-US relationship, keeping high-level engagement between the two countries going despite differences over bilateral matters and geopolitical issues that have bogged down ties.There was no readout by either side of the meeting till late in the evening and Jaishankar only said in a post on X that he appreciated the discussion on bilateral ties as well as regional and global issues. Later, while delivering India's national statement at the East Asia summit, Jaishankar took a dig at the US and European countries as he said principles of energy trade were being applied selectively.It is understood that Jaishankar and Rubio touched upon ongoing efforts to finalise a bilateral trade agreement and also the issue of energy trade. The Donald Trump administration has slapped India with an additional 25% tariff for its oil procurement from Russia, accusing India of bankrolling Russia's war on Ukraine.This was the second meeting between Jaishankar and Rubio in the past two months. They had also met on the margins of the UNGA last month where they discussed cooperation in a number of areas. They had also agreed to continue working together to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including through Quad.There was no confirmation about whether there was any discussion in the meeting on Monday on the Quad summit that India has to host in the near future.Later in the day, Jaishankar also met his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and discussed cooperation among Quad countries. According to a Japanese readout, Motegi emphasised that Japan and India play a significant role in realising peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and expressed his desire to fulfill this role together with other Quad States. ""Agreed to work closely to implement the joint vision for the next decade of our cooperation. Also exchanged perspectives on the global situation and our Indo Pacific cooperation. Our conversation reflected the strength and warmth of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership,"" said Jaishankar in a post on X.","Second meeting between eam, rubio in 2 months.

'What Is Preached Not Necessarily Practiced’: Jaishankar Takes Veiled Swipe At West Over Trade

Jaishankar welcomes Gaza peace plan, seeks early end to Ukraine-Russia conflict

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar flagged what the Indian govt sees as US and Europe's double standards in pressuring India to stop buying Russian oil, as he addressed the East Asia Summit in Malaysia, filling in for PM Modi. He said energy trade is increasingly constricted, with resulting market distortions, and ""principles are applied selectively and what is preached is not necessarily practised"".Jaishankar, who delivered India's statement at the summit after meeting his US counterpart Marco Rubio, sought an early end to conflicts as he stressed how in current circumstances energy flows and food security were being undermined. He said India's right of defence against terror can never be compromised.Jaishankar said terrorism poses a continuous and corrosive threat and the world must display zero tolerance. There is no room for ambivalence, he said.The minister made the point about energy trade while talking about growing concerns over reliability of supply chains and access to markets in complicated times. Jaishankar said technology advancement had become very competitive and the quest for natural resources even more so.Jaishankar emphasised that change has a life of its own and the world will inevitably respond to new circumstances. ""Adjustments will be made, calculations will come into play, fresh understandings will be forged, new opportunities will emerge and resilient solutions will be devised. At the end of the day, the realities of technology, of competitiveness, of market size, digitisation, connectivity, of talent and of mobility cannot be ignored,"" said the minister, adding multipolarity would continue to grow. He called for serious global conversations to address these issues.EAS is an annual Asean-led forum that includes the bloc's dialogue partners like India, China and the US.The minister also said both sides shared concerns about cyber scam centres in the region, which has also entrapped Indian nationals.Jaishankar welcomed the Gaza peace plan and sought an early end to the conflict in Ukraine.""We are also witnessing conflicts that have significant repercussions, near and far. Deep human suffering apart, they undermine food security, they threaten energy flows and they disrupt trade,"" said the minister.Jaishankar underscored India's commitment to furthering maritime cooperation, in line with the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and the shared commitment to the 1982 UNCLOS.""We wish to propose an EAS Maritime Heritage Festival to be held in the ancient port of Lothal in Gujarat. We also intend to host the 7th EAS Conference on Maritime Security Cooperation,"" announced Jaishankar.Talking about Myanmar, Jaishankar highlighted how India was the first responder during the March earthquake and said the India-Mynamar-Thailand Trilateral Highway projects will continue to progress.","External affairs minister s jaishankar flagged what the indian govt sees as us and europe's double standards in pressuring india to stop buying russian oil.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: SC Monday said hurling a shoe at an SC judge in courtroom is criminal contempt in the face of the court but expressed reluctance to initiate contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore, who engaged in the act against CJI BR Gavai, saying the judge who faced the attempted assault alone could punish the contemnor.SC Bar Association chief and senior advocate Vikas Singh repeatedly requested a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi to entertain association's plea seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore.""His subsequent conduct is even more contemptuous as, instead of being remorseful, he boasted he would do it again and that it was a command from God. This is an insult to God as no God would give such a command,"" Singh said.Justices Kant and Bagchi said that under Contempt of Court Act, 1971, only the judge before whom anyone attempts or commits contempt in the face of the court has jurisdiction to initiate contempt proceedings in matter.""The act of the advocate is a serious and grave criminal contempt of court. His subsequent conduct aggravates his crime. But once the CJI has magnanimously pardoned him, there is little we can do. We also do not think the attorney general can give consent for initiation of contempt proceedings in a case involving criminal contempt in the face of the court,"" the bench said.Justice Kant pointed out that initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore would only serve his design of getting cheap publicity on social media. ""He should be treated with the contempt he deserves for the abominable action,"" the bench said, though adding that it was ready to consider the larger issue at hand - the issuance of a John Doe order restraining social media from glorifying such incidents. The bench said it would keep the larger issue pending and attempt to frame guidelines for media, especially social media, on reporting such incidents.","Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi expressed reluctance to initiate contempt proceedings against advocate rakesh kishore.

'Our Army Just Sat And Watched...': Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals BIG SECRET on Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India Monday briefed the UAE about Operation Sindoor , even as the two countries work to enhance bilateral military cooperation and explore new avenues for collaboration, especially in training and capability enhancement.Visiting UAE commander of land forces, Major General Yousef Maayouf Saeed Al Hallami, was ""briefed in detail"" by the Indian Army about the four-day cross-border hostilities with Pakistan in May.""He was also briefed by DG information systems and the Army Design Bureau on India's defence capabilities and the AI roadmap,"" an officer said. On Tuesday, the top UAE officer will interact with DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat, who will brief him on various indigenous weapons systems and equipment, as well as representatives of Indian defence industries.This comes after India offered the indigenous Akash air defence missile system to the UAE at the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the visiting Dubai crown prince and UAE deputy PM Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum here in April.","Uae commander of land forces, major general yousef maayouf saeed al hallami, was ""briefed in detail"" by the indian army about the four-day cross-border hostilities with pakistan in may.

'Some Nations Are Openly Violating...': Rajnath Singh Sends Strong Rule-Based World Order Message

NEW DELHI: India needs to be ""ready for a war-like situation"", with military preparedness being based on indigenous foundations, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Monday, asking the industry to further accelerate self-reliance in defence production.India gave ""a firm response with a firm resolve"" to Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10 and the armed forces are fully prepared to defend the country's borders, Singh said.""(But) we must continue to introspect. Operation Sindoor should serve as a case study from which we can learn and chart our future course. This incident has once again shown us that anything can happen at our borders, anywhere, at any time,"" he said, addressing the annual session of the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM).The effective use of Made-in-India equipment like Akash and BrahMos missiles as well as AkashTeer air defence control system during Operation Sindoor bolstered India's reputation both regionally and internationally.The domestic industry, especially private sector, should step-up the focus on innovation and R&D, technology-based manufacturing, production of individual subsystems & components, and dominating the supply and maintenance chains, he added.Present-day global uncertainties call for an in-depth assessment of every domain, with 'indigenisation' being the only way to deal with the challenges emanating from the constantly evolving nature of warfare. ""The established world order is weakening, and conflict zones are increasing in many regions. It has, therefore, become necessary for India to redefine its security and strategy,"" Singh said.","India gave ""a firm response with a firm resolve"" to pakistan during the cross-border hostilities.

The Market Implications

Theare once again at the center of MLB’s offseason drama, as trade rumors swirl around. With the Winter Meetings approaching, industry insiders believe the Dodgers could make a historic move to acquire the left-handed phenom, potentially forming one of the most dominant rotations in baseball alongside Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani Skubal’s name has quickly become the hottest topic of the offseason. The Detroit Tigers have long viewed him as their franchise pitcher, but uncertainty over his contract future has created a massive trade buzz. The 27-year-old southpaw, who could command an unprecedented $400 million deal, is represented by agent Scott Boras - making negotiations even more complicated.Detroit’s front office has reportedly tried to negotiate an extension, but the gap between the two sides appears insurmountable. According to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, “The Tigers and superstar pitcher Tarik Skubal have a lot of work to do if they’re going to bridge quite possibly the biggest gap in MLB negotiating history: an estimated quarter of a billion dollars. Yep, that’s not a misprint. It’s close to $250 million. ” (H/t: Sporting News)Jim Costa of 97.1 The Ticket highlighted the current state of negotiations, writing, “Two things I believe to be true.1. Scott Boras and Tarik Skubal want to hit free agency a year from now. No extension this offseason. 2. The Tigers are not going all in to win with Skubal in 2026.”This sentiment reflects Detroit’s hesitancy to commit long-term money while still rebuilding its roster. With Skubal likely eyeing the open market, trading him now could allow the Tigers to capitalize on his peak value.Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers are in prime position to pounce. After adding two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and 2023 NL Cy Young winner Blake Snell, Los Angeles could solidify one of the most overpowering rotations in baseball history by acquiring Skubal.If the Los Angeles Dodgers pull off this deal, their starting pitching depth could be unmatched. Here’s what their projected rotation might resemble:Such a lineup would give Los Angeles perhaps the best rotation ever assembled, blending youth, experience, and generational talent.Veteran MLB insider Jim Bowden of The Athletic believes the Dodgers could realistically make the move, citing both financial capability and competitive urgency. “Skubal will reset the market for pitchers and become the highest-paid starting pitcher in history, with a realistic starting price north of $400 million. Therefore, even though the Tigers are in position to compete for the postseason next year, it’s likely they shop Skubal at the Winter Meetings and try to make the best trade they can,” Bowden wrote.If a deal happens, it could reshape not only the Los Angeles Dodgers’ future but also the free-agent pitching market. A $400 million valuation would surpass any previous pitching contract in MLB history, setting a new benchmark for elite arms.Potential teams like the Yankees, Rangers, and Giants may show interest, but few can match the Los Angeles Dodgers’ mix of prospect depth, payroll flexibility, and championship urgency.Los Angeles has never shied away from bold moves, and this offseason is proving no different. Pairing Tarik Skubal with Blake Snell and Shohei Ohtani could make the Los Angeles Dodgers nearly untouchable in the National League.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees predicted to sign to $68 million 6x NPB All-Star to replace Cody Bellinget Their batting order, already one of the most feared in baseball, would have the perfect complement - arguably the strongest starting rotation ever assembled.","Detroit tigers ace tarik skubal is once again at the center of mlb’s offseason drama.

He totaledthrough seven games, still ranking among the top tight ends in every major category.Here are thefor both teams heading into Monday night’s matchup:Beyond the Week 8 standings, this matchup is a statement opportunity.

Mangold was battling chronic kidney disease for nearly 19 years and was also undergoing dialysis for it. Just 10 days back, the former Ohio State Buckeyes center posted on social media asking for a kidney donor with type O blood.Mangold was diagnosed with a genetic defect that led to chronic kidney disease. He underwent dialysis, but after a difficult summer, he began looking for a kidney transplant. He knew the day was coming, but he always thought he had more time. Since no family members were able to donate, he reached out to the public on social media. The Jets legend’s social media post asking for a kidney donor read—“In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I’m undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant. I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time. Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I’m reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities.I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.” Mangold had also shared the website details to find out if the donor was a match for him. He later expressed gratitude to anyone willing to consider donating to him. “I am deeply grateful to anyone that would consider donating,” the Jets center wrote.“Most of all, I’m thankful for my family, who have been my rock every step of the way. This situation has reminded me how lucky I am to have such an amazing family, friends, and community behind me,” Mangold expressed gratitude in his October 14 social media post.The Jets star was looking forward to getting back to full strength—“While this has been a tough stretch, I’m staying positive and focused on the path ahead. I’m looking forward to better days and getting back to full strength soon. I’ll see you all at MetLife Stadium & The Shoe very soon.”“Nick was more than a legendary center. He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick’s wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family,” Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement.","Mangold was diagnosed with a genetic defect that led to chronic kidney disease.

World’s 9 weakest passports in 2025: Countries with the least travel freedom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/destinations/worlds-9-weakest-passports-in-2025-countries-with-the-least-travel-freedom/articleshow/124721967.cms,"Afghanistan (Rank 104, Score 25)

A passport is an important travel document for those who wish to explore other countries. It allows people international travel freedom. But the ranking of passports also matters. If a country’s passport is strong, the residents can often travel visa free or visa-on-arrival facilities to several nations. But when a country’s passport is weak, it only creates issues in obtaining a visa and also lacks several other powers that come along with strong passports.The rankings are reflection of much deeper and larger issues including political instability, limited diplomatic influence and international relations. These are prime reasons restricting travel freedom for citizens of the affected countries.According to the latest (2025) Henley Passport Index ranking, the passport of Afghanistan is the weakest and grants visa-free access to only 25 countries. On this note, let’s have a look at 9 weakest passports in the world.Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.Afghan nationals can enter only 25 countries without a visa. This restricted travel freedom stems primarily from ongoing conflict, political instability, and limited diplomatic influence. For the majority of international destinations, Afghan travelers face lengthy and often uncertain visa application procedures, significantly limiting their global mobility.Syria ranks second on the list, largely due to prolonged civil conflict and political instability. Only a handful of countries allow Syrians visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry, while most impose strict entry requirements. Security concerns remain the primary reason behind such limited travel access for Syrian passport holders.Iraq’s passport also offers limited visa-free access. It is because of political instability, security issues, and the country’s changing diplomatic relationships. Iraqi passport holders commonly need to apply for visas in advance.Pakistan’s passport ranks low primarily due to ongoing political instability, security concerns, and strained cross-border relations. Citizens frequently face lengthy and complex visa procedures, with a relatively high rate of application rejections compared to many other countries.Yemen has a bad security situation, the state of the country is greatly affected by political instability. The passport has limited reach, leaving many destinations off-limits. Humanitarian crises are also there. Outside travel requires careful planning and prior approvals.Somalia’s passport is affected by long-standing political instability. There are security challenges too and a limited diplomatic network. Many countries need Somalis to obtain visas before travel. Progress in governance and expanded bilateral relations is needed.Nepal’s low rank reflects a passport that Nepalis still require visas for many popular destinations. They might enjoy easier travel within South Asia and some neighboring countries, but long-haul travel involves advance visa applications.Palestinian territories also face a lot of issues. There are diplomatic and recognition issues. Passport holders require lengthy full visa processing. Geopolitical constraints and limited state recognition continue to restrict the mobility of many Palestinians.Libya’s passport has slightly higher access, yet remains burdened by political instability and security issues. Libyans frequently face prior-visa requirements and unpredictable processing times. Any sustained improvements in political stability and international relations would likely be the principal route to expand Libyan citizens’ travel freedoms.These nine weak passports of the countries only reflect how security concerns, political instability, cross border tensions, and diplomatic relationships directly affect not only international but everyday freedom to travel. It’s a difficult travel situation for the citizens of these nine nations. With lengthy visa processes and no surety of obtaining one, international mobility is often a matter of careful planning and several official approvals. It also limits work options, education, or family visits abroad, and personal opportunities too.Ultimately, a passport is more than a travel document - it’s a reflection of a nation’s global standing and stability. As countries work toward peace, stronger governance, and better diplomatic ties, their citizens may someday gain the freedom to move across borders with greater ease and dignity.","Afghanistan holds the 104th position on the global passport index, making it the least powerful passport worldwide.

Giants must find new direction with Tyrone Tracy Jr. while Cam Skattebo heals

Young QB Jaxson Dart and the Giants offense enter resilience mode

The New York Giants had been riding the youthful fire of rookie running back Cam Skattebo, a mid-round gem who injected life into an offense searching for identity. That spark dimmed abruptly during Sunday’s loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, when Skattebo suffered a severe ankle injury that halted both the stadium and New York’s momentum in a single breath. The rookie had already piled up 587 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns, becoming a fast favorite in Brian Daboll’s reshaped attack.Now, the torch passes to Tyrone Tracy Jr., a player built from the durable cloth coaches trust. He doesn’t possess Skattebo’s lightning-bolt explosiveness, but he offers a calm steadiness that NFL teams cling to when storms hit. Tracy logged 839 rushing yards last season with zero fumbles. He already has 120 yards and a touchdown this season while embracing the gritty jobs like pass pro that rarely make highlight reels.Tom Brady, analyzing from the FOX booth, urged the Giants to stay the course. “They have Tyrone Tracy, who did have a thousand yards rushing as a rookie last year,” he said, slightly inflating the stat sheet but nailing the sentiment: New York can keep its ground game alive. Brady doubled down on belief in the offensive line too, saying, “There’s no reason to...he’s getting good protection from his guys up front.”This setback hit just as New York was beginning to eye a possible future with Skattebo and fellow rookie Jaxson Dart steering the ship. Every promising season has a plot twist, and the NFL rarely hands out sympathy cards. Brady offered perspective from a career defined by surviving these gut-punch moments: “I know it’s a tough injury, but that’s football; you’ve got to deal with it… and find a way to compete.”The Giants’ season now shifts from “breakout” to “battle through.” If Tracy keeps the chains moving and Dart keeps growing, New York may yet turn this adversity into proof of character rather than the beginning of another collapse.Also Read: Bill Belichick facing uncertainty at North Carolina: insiders reveal what could be next for the legendary coach","Rookie running back cam skattebo suffered a severe ankle injury, halting the new york giants' momentum.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The us supreme court (sc) declined to hear an appeal by save jobs usa.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Battle For New York City: Is Zohran Mamdani New Hope For Democrats Against Trump? | Global Pulse





Two prominent MAGA Republican lawmakers have formally demanded the US Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate putative New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, whose mother is the Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, with the explicit goal of revoking his American citizenship and triggering deportation proceedings.Florida Congressman Randy Fine this week joined his GOP colleague Andy Ogles of Tennessee in seeking a Justice Department review into Mamdani’s 2018 naturalization, citing among other things, failure to disclose membership in the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which they deem as a communist organization, on his citizenship application.They also say Mamdani’s past public remarks and associations with radical groups raise questions about potential ties to entities that might have been viewed as “totalitarian” or “anti-American” under the laws governing naturalization.Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani, now 31, arrived in the U.S. at age 7 and became a citizen in 2018. He is vying to become the first Muslim mayor of New York – a city with the biggest Jewish population outside Israel – in an election that has attracted both national and global attention. Polls show Mamdani leading the November 4 election by double-digit margins in a race even President Trump – who branded him a ""100% Communist Lunatic"" on Truth Social – has conceded.While Mamdani’s meteoric rise had triggered MAGA Republicans, it has also split the Indian-American community, with some conservative groups accusing him of “victimhood politics,” hostility towards Prime Minister Modi, and making statements that they say are insensitive towards Hindu traditions, and progressive groups backing him.In a separate development, the New York Post on Monday reported that ""China-owned"" TikTok allegedly manipulated its platform's algorithm to disproportionately feed New York residents pro-Mamdani videos, bringing into the election another “foreign hand” angle. More U.S lawmakers jumped into the fray with Texas Senator Ted Cruz snarkily asking on X, “Now why would the CCP want a commie jihadist as mayor of NYC?”“Comrade Mamdani is the future of the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party is now explicitly and unapologetically communist and jihadist,” Cruz said in a separate post as MAGA Republicans fumed at the prospect of the crown jewel among American cities being governed by an Indian-origin Muslim immigrant who became a naturalized US citizen less than a decade ago.While President Trump and administration mandarins have not entertained calls from MAGA hardliners to denaturalize Mamdani, legal experts say stripping a naturalized citizen of US citizenship, while possible if citizenship was obtained through ""willful misrepresentation,"" is very rare given the high burden of proof. They also caution that targeting political speech and affiliations, such as the disputed interpretation of the DSA as a ""communist organization"" or rap lyrics as ""material support"" to terrorism – one of MAGA allegations against Mamdani – would face strong First Amendment protections in court.Mamdani has dismissed the accusations as ""racist bullshit,"" underscoring his nearly three decades in the US and his campaign’s focus on affordability and working-class issues that have electrified what is arguably the world’s most diverse city, with more than 35 per cent of its population foreign-born.","Zohran mamdani, 31, is vying to become the first muslim mayor of new york.

'Drugged' Sikh Truck Driver Behind Fiery Crash in California Reignites Illegal Immigration Debate

21-year-old truck driver Jashanpreet Singh's recent appearance in the court on charges of vehicular manslaughter under the influence in California shocked his family members and the Sikh community as Singh was seen without a turban. A petition has now been started demanding the return of his turban immediately, as snatching his turban is a violation of his Sikh identity. Jashanpreet pleaded not guilty to all the charges -- three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. His family in India said he's a baptized Sikh and hence does not do drugs.Jashanpreet is now in jail and will appear in court next on November 4. Court documents revealed that he would need a Punjabi interpreter in his next court appearance.The administration called Jashanpreet Singh an illegal alien though Singh had Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate the truck he was driving.Calling his treatment in the US disrespectful to the Sikhs, many social media users asked whether he would still remain an asylum seeker in the US despite the treatment he's receiving there.The Change.org petition demanding the return of Jashanpreet's turban said Singh had been wrongfully accused by media outlets of drug use, tarnishing his reputation. The petition said that there has been no concrete evidence supporting his drug use but that made the headlines while he is an 'Amritdhari Sikh'.""The presumption of innocence until proven guilty, a foundational principle of justice, has been blatantly disregarded. In this climate of misinformation and prejudice, Jashanpreet has also been stripped of his turban—a deeply significant symbol of his faith and identity. This act is not only an infringement on his personal beliefs but an assault on our entire community's cultural and religious values,"" the petition said.""We are calling upon the judicial system to reconsider Jashanpreet's case with fairness and empathy, taking into account his clean history and the lack of evidence against him. The sentence he received is disproportionate and does not reflect the reality of his situation. We urge the authorities to return Jashanpreet’s turban to him immediately, respecting his rights and dignity as a Sikh,"" it said.",Jashanpreet singh is in jail and will appear in the court next on november 4.
