‘We played chess’: Army chief says saw 'political clarity' during Op Sindoor; recalls tactics used,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-played-chess-army-chief-says-saw-political-clarity-during-op-sindoor-recalls-tactics-used/articleshow/123213383.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief of Army Staff Gen Upendra Dwivedi offered fresh insights into Operation Sindoor , describing it as a high-stakes “game of chess” fought in the “grey zone” of warfare. Speaking at IIT Madras on Saturday, during the inauguration of the Indian Army Research Cell, Dwivedi explained that the operation was a carefully calibrated military response, short of a conventional war but designed to deliver decisive blows.“In Operation Sindoor, we played chess. We did not know what the enemy’s next move was going to be, and what we were going to do. This is called the grey zone,” he said. “Somewhere we were giving them the checkmate and somewhere we were going in for the kill at the risk of losing our own — but that’s what life is all about.”Recounting the days following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, Dwivedi said, “On the 23rd, the next day itself, we all sat down. This was the first time that RM [Defence Minister Rajnath Singh] said, ‘Enough is enough.’ The free hand was given — ‘you decide what is to be done’. That is the kind of confidence, political direction and political clarity we saw for the first time.”He added that by April 25, the Northern Command had planned and executed strikes on seven of nine identified targets, destroying terrorist infrastructure and killing large numbers of militants.The COAS said the operation galvanised the country. “That is something which galvanised the whole nation. That is the reason the whole nation was saying why have you stopped? That question was being asked and it has been amply answered,” he remarked.On Friday, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh also disclosed, for the first time, the number of Pakistani assets destroyed. “We have at least five fighters confirmed kills and one large aircraft… the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,” he said, adding that radar sites, air defence systems and aircraft hangars were also targeted. Singh credited the “very clear political will” of the government for giving the armed forces complete operational freedom.Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7, was India’s response to the Pahalgam attack, targeting terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.","Chief of army staff gen upendra dwivedi offered fresh insights into operation sindoor.

LS | Rahul Gandhi's Remarks | Special discussion on 'Operation Sindoor' | 29 July, 2025

NEW DELHI: Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal AP Singh on Saturday attributed the success of Operation Sindoor to the “political will” of the central government, asserting that the Indian Armed Forces carried out the mission without any external constraints.His remarks came in response to criticism from the opposition, particularly leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi who recently attacked PM Narendra Modi in the House by questioning the government’s resolve.“A key reason for success was the presence of political will. There was very clear political will and very clear directions given to us. No restrictions were put on us... If there were any constraints, they were self-made. The forces decided what the rules of engagement would be. We decided how we wanted to control the escalation. We had full freedom to plan and execute,” Singh said at an event at the HAL Management Academy in Bengaluru.The air force chief highlighted that the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) played a key role in uniting the Army, Navy, and Air Force to work in coordination. “There was a synchronisation between the three forces...The post of CDS made a real difference. He was there to get us together. NSA also played a big role in getting all the agencies,” he said.The IAF chief also emphasised the importance of ""terminating a war"".""Our objective was very clear. Our objective was to teach the terrorists a lesson that they will think twice before doing something; now they know what kind of price they can pay. And once we have achieved those objectives, we should look for all windows of opportunity to stop that, rather than just continuing.""We were actually on a song that night. I heard from so many people...some people very close to me also said 'Aur Marna Tha',"" he said.He called the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system a ""game-changer"" and said that Pakistan was not able to penetrate the system.""The range of that system had kept Pakistan's aircraft and UAVs away from the Indian defence system. Because of the S-400 system, Pakistan has not been able to penetrate the Indian air defence system,"" he noted.Earlier in Parliament, Rahul Gandhi had accused the PM Modi led government of lacking political will during Operation Sindoor. “You told the Pakistanis exactly what you would do. You told them we would not hit military targets, you told them we do not want escalation... It means you have directly told Pakistan that you do not have the political will to fight,” Rahul Gandhi said, also alleging that political constraints led to the loss of Indian fighter jets.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.

Trump Reveals Location For Putin Meeting; 'Hidden Message' For Russian President? | Ukraine War

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday welcomed the agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025, describing it as a possible breakthrough in ending the war in Ukraine.“India welcomes the understanding reached between the United States and the Russian Federation for a meeting in Alaska on 15th August 2025. This meeting holds the promise of bringing to an end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and opening up the prospects for peace. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said on several occasions - This is not an era of war,"" the ministry of external affairs said in a statement released on Saturday.""India, therefore, endorses the upcoming Summit meeting and stands ready to support these efforts,"" it further added.The statement comes as Trump imposed 50% tariff on India, accusing it of supporting Moscow's 'war machine' against Ukraine by buying Russian oil.US had earlier announced 25% additional duties on Indian imports in the country, on the top of an already 25% tariff, taking the total to 50%.The order specified that ""The ad valorem duty imposed...shall be in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports...""The implementation timeline shows the base duty taking effect from August 7, whilst the additional charge begins from August 27, following a 21-day period.The order said, ""I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25%.""US President Donald Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, in an effort to negotiate a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has seen numerous failed rounds of talks.It will be Putin’s first visit to the United States in a decade, his last being in 2015 for the UN General Assembly in New York.For Trump, the meeting marks his most direct attempt yet to fulfil his campaign pledge to end the war “within 24 hours,” a promise that has faced repeated setbacks despite phone calls, peace talks and diplomatic visits.The choice of Alaska is has symbolic importance as Russia sold the territory to the US in 1867, and its western tip sits just across the Bering Strait from Russia’s easternmost point.The Kremlin confirmed the meeting after US envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow. During his visit, Witkoff proposed a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but Russia did not respond to the idea.“The Russian side left this option completely without comment,” Kremlin spokesperson Ushkov said.Earlier, Trump had told reporters he would likely meet Putin face-to-face “very soon.”His efforts to halt Russia’s military offensive have so far yielded little progress, with three rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv ending without a breakthrough.","India welcomes the agreement between us president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin to hold a summit in alaska on august 15, 2025.

NEW DELHI: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered to help India in dealing with 50% tariffs imposed by the US, saying that he would give PM Narendra Modi ""some advice"" on dealing with Donald Trump. However, he jokingly added the the advice would be given in ""private"".He also claimed that Israeli weapons were used in Operation Sindoor and said that ""all of them worked well."" He also offered to help India boost its ""surveillance"" system to tackle cross-border terrorism.Speaking to the journalists on Thursday, he added that he would like to visit India ""soon"". He also expressed Israel’s interest in establishing direct flights between Tel Aviv and Bengaluru, noting it would cut travel time to just six hours, shorter than a flight to San Francisco.Speaking on the deadlock on trade deal and tariff imposition, the Israeli PM said that it was imperative for India and the US to reach a common ground. With a touch of humor, he quipped that he would offer PM Modi some advice on handling Trump, “but privately.”""Modi and Trump are terrific friends of mine. Yes I would give Modi some advice (on dealing with Trump), but privately,"" PTI quoted him as saying.""There is a basic understanding in relationship between India and the US.The basis of the relationship is very solid. It will be in the interest of India and the US to arrive at a common ground and resolve the tariff issue.

NEW DELHI: India’s cutting-edge BrahMos missiles and Akashteer air defence system were pivotal in Operation Sindoor , the retaliatory strike carried out on May 7 following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, that claimed 26 lives, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chairman Samir V Kamat said on Saturday.Speaking to reporters in Pune, Kamat explained that during the offensive phase, the BrahMos missile, primarily launched from the Sukhoi Mk 1 aircraft, served as the principal strike weapon, while Akashteer formed the backbone of the defensive systems.“When it comes to offensive weapons, BrahMos was the primary weapon used, which was launched from our Sukhoi Mark 1 platform. When it comes to defensive weapon systems, the Akashteer system, the anti-drone system and the MRSAM were used,” Kamat said, as quoted by news agency ANI.He further detailed how the Akashteer network integrated all sensors, enabling the identification of incoming threats and the selection of the right weapons to neutralise them. “Advanced early warning and control aircraft were also used for advanced surveillance. This is broadly what I can say without getting into too much,” he added.Akashteer, a fully indigenous automated Air Defence Control and Reporting System, has proved its capability in intercepting and neutralising incoming projectiles during India-Pakistan hostilities.BrahMos, a product of Indo-Russian defence cooperation, has enhanced India’s deterrent posture with its precision strikes, supersonic speed, and long range.Expressing pride in the indigenous capabilities demonstrated during Operation Sindoor, Kamat said, “It’s indeed a proud moment for all of us. It’s a reflection of the strength of our R&D and production in the defence domain. I’m sure going ahead, this number will keep increasing.”The operation’s success, he noted, has sparked increased interest from foreign buyers. As per ANI, India’s defence exports touched a record Rs 23,622 crore in FY 2024–25, up 12 per cent from the previous year. Kamat said exports could double in the next two to three years due to global interest in systems like Pinaka, ATAGS, BrahMos and Akash.Annual defence production also reached an all-time high of Rs 1,50,590 crore in FY 2024–25 — an 18 per cent rise over the previous year and a 90 per cent jump since 2019–20. Kamat credited this growth to the central government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India initiatives, which have boosted domestic manufacturing and reduced reliance on imports.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has lauded the achievement as a clear indicator of India’s growing defence industrial base, with Defence Public Sector Undertakings accounting for 77 per cent of total production and private firms contributing 23 per cent.Kamat added that interest is coming from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and that India’s self-reliance in defence manufacturing is now not just a strategic goal but a necessity, as underscored by the recent conflict with Pakistan.","Brahmos led the offensive, akashteer guarded the skies: drdo chief details weapons behind operation sindoor.

He said the issue was addressed during Operation Sindoor , where recorded footage of the airstrikes helped lay to rest what he called the “ghost of Balakot.”""In Balakot, we could not get anything from inside, and it became a big issue trying to tell our own people, unfortunately, as to what we have been able to achieve. We had intelligence (human kind of intelligence) on what had gone on inside, where we had a very clear picture of the inside in terms of there having been huge damage. There have been so many terrorists who have been neutralised, but we could not convince our own people that, look, we have achieved that,"" he said addressing a gathering at the Hal Management Academy.""Things like this would have given us the same problem (regarding Operation Sindoor). However, we were lucky that we got these videos in the open. So, I'm very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot, and we were able to tell the world what we have achieved,"" he added.Several opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, had asked for a proof on Balakot airstrikes which were carried in response to Pulwama terror attack that claimed the lives of at least 40 CRPF soldiers.“I read in newspapers that families of CRPF jawans have raised the demand. This is their feeling and Congress leaders have also spoken on this and it’s done. I don’t want to go into this issue. This is the feeling among families of jawans that we have been hurt and we should be shown what has been done on this,” Rahul Gandhi had said in 2019.More recently, Congress MP and former Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi questioned the Balakot surgical strikes, reiterating his long-standing demand for proof of the operation.""Till date, I could not find where the (surgical) strike took place, where men were killed at that time, and where this happened in Pakistan. Will we not find out if a bomb is dropped in our country? They say that they did a surgical strike in Pakistan. Nothing had happened. Nowhere was a surgical strike seen.

NEW DELHI: Congress leaders on Saturday continued to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite the Indian Air Force (IAF) chief’s disclosure that it had shot down at least five Pakistani fighter jets and one airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft during Operation Sindoor in May.“In view of the new revelations made today by Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh, it becomes all the more shocking why the PM suddenly stopped Operation Sindoor on the evening of May 10. Where did the pressure come from, and why did he capitulate so very soon?” Congress MP and party communications chief Jairam Ramesh wrote on X.Lok Sabha deputy leader of the opposition Gaurav Gogoi also pressed for answers, asking what “concessions” the prime minister may have secured from Pakistan before “abruptly” ending the operation.“The question remains: what concessions did Prime Minister Modi extract from the Pakistani leadership before abruptly ending Operation Sindoor on the evening of May 10?” Gogoi posted.Seizing upon Donald Trump’s repeated claim that he brokered the ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, the Congress-led opposition has been accusing the prime minister of “surrendering” to the US president.The government has strongly rejected Trump’s assertion, saying it was Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations who contacted his Indian counterpart to request a ceasefire—accepted by India as it had achieved all its military objectives.Launched in the early hours of May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, Operation Sindoor targeted terror infrastructure at nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, triggering cross-border skirmishes in the days that followed.",Congress leaders continue to question prime minister narendra modi.

NEW DELHI: Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Amar Preet Singh on Saturday said the forces shot down five Pakistani jets and one airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft during the Operation Sindoor The IAF Chief’s remark is the first confirmation from any high-ranking official of the number of Pakistani jets India damaged during its cross-border anti-terror operation.""We have five confirmed kills and one large aircraft, which could be either an ELINT aircraft or an AEW&C aircraft, which was taken on at a distance of about 300 kilometres. This is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill that we can talk about,"" the Air Force chief said while speaking at the Air Chief Marshal LM Katre Memorial Lecture in Bengaluru.Singh said that the key reason for the operation's success was the presence of political will, and claimed that if there were any constraints, they were self-made -- a statement which trashes US President Donald Trump's repeated assertions that he used trade as leverage to materialise a truce between India and Pakistan.""A key reason for success was the presence of political will. There were very clear directions given to us.No restrictions were put on us... If there were any constraints, they were self-made... We decided how much to escalate... We had full freedom to plan and execute. Our attacks were calibrated because we wanted to be mature about it... There was a synchronisation between the three forces... The post of CDS made a real difference. He was there to get us together...NSA also played a big role in getting all the agencies,"" the IAF chief added.Singh said that during the operation, the forces damaged an F-16 hangar in Shahbaz Jacobabad airfield, saying: ""We have an indication of at least one AEW&C in that AEW&C hangar and a few F-16s, which were under maintenance there"".""Shahbaz Jacobabad airfield, one of the major airfields that was attacked. Here there's an F-16 hangar. One half of the hangar is gone. And I'm sure there were some aircraft inside which have got damaged there. We were able to get at least two command and control centres, like Murid and Chaklala.

So it just so happens that I got my chance just before I retired... So we took on the airfield there,"" the Chief of the Air Staff said.He said that as far as India's offensive was concerned, ""that night we didn't have any hold bar and we decided that we would go attack at Pan Front, we would stretch resources"".""None of their aircraft could come anywhere near the boundaries of Akash and even MRSAM. All their aircraft were taken on by LRSAM because they were trying to stay away, but still they were within our range at times, and that is the opportunity targets that we got. As far as our offensive was concerned, that night we didn't have any hold bar and we decided that we would go attack at Pan Front, we would stretch resources. The idea was once again not to attack one particular airfield and decimate that airfield. The idea was to give him that feeling or give him that indication that look, we can attack you deep inside, at will, wherever we want to...Bholari, an AEW&C hangar, was attacked. And here we have a very clear hint that there was an aircraft in sight when this attack took place,"" he said.He also said that India's air defence systems did a wonderful job and praised the S-400 system, calling it a game-changer.""Our air defence systems have done a wonderful job. The S-400 system, which we had recently bought, has been a game-changer. The range of that system has really kept their aircraft away from their weapons like, those long-range glide bombs that they have, they have not been able to use any one of those because they have not been able to penetrate the system,"" the IAF chief said.He said that India's long-range, accurate weapons were used in the operation, and special emphasis was given to avoid civilian casualties.Showing the before and after images of the damage India caused at Bahawalpur, where the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed's headquarters are located, Singh said: ""There's hardly any collateral here... The adjacent buildings are fairly intact... Not only did we have satellite pictures, but also from local media, through which we could get inside pictures.""The IAF chief said: ""People got down to their egos in the war...

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The downing of a large Pakistani aircraft in the air during Operation Sindoor was ""actually the largest-ever recorded surface-to-air kill by India"", Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said Saturday.Delivering the 16th ACM LM Katre memorial lecture in Bengaluru, Singh said, ""One large aircraft, which could be either an ELINT (electronic intelligence) aircraft or an AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft, was taken out at a distance of 300km... The S-400 was a game changer for us.""Armed with slides and satellite grabs at Bengaluru that exorcised the ""ghost of Balakot"" in the recent air-to-ground strikes with credible evidence, ACM Singh also said IAF's surface-to-air missile systems, primarily the Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' air defence system, had ""five confirmed kills"" of Pakistani fighters in the air.The confirmation for all these kills, of course, is only through electronic means, with their blips disappearing from radar screens after being hit by missiles, and not physical since the wreckage of the planes fell in Pakistan.Singh, however, did not quantify the IAF fighter losses during the initial strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, which were conducted without suppression or destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) that is typically undertaken before launching any air campaign.Chief of defence staff Gen Anil Chauhan, on the sidelines of the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore on May 31, had admitted India lost some fighter jets during the initial strikes but then changed tactics (including undertaking SEAD/DEAD) to inflict major damage on Pakistani airbases deep across the border.Other senior officers told TOI that the S-400 system, which has missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km as well as long-range acquisition and engagement radars, had engaged 16-18 targets in the air during the hostilities.""Apart from the five Pakistani jets and one large aircraft or 'high-value aerial asset', the others were incoming large UAVs, cruise missiles and long-range stand-off weapons like the H2 and H4 precision-guided glide bombs,"" an officer said.The IAF chief, on his part, said three Pakistani aircraft hangars were also targeted during air-to-ground strikes - UAV hangar at Sukkur, AEW&C hangar at Bholari & F-16 hangar at Jacobabad.The IAF deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 jets to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for calibrated pinpoint strikes.At least one AEW&C aircraft, possibly a Swedish-origin Saab Erieye, and ""a few F-16s"" were under maintenance inside the Bholari and Jacobabad hangars at that time. ""One half of the Jacobabad hangar is gone. I am sure there were some aircraft inside,"" ACM Singh said.Other such strikes destroyed two surface-to-air guided weapon sites at Lahore and Okara, two underground command centres at Murid and Chaklala and six radar centres, ""some big, some small"", the IAF chief added.Officers said these radar sites were at Sukkur, Lahore, Arifwala, Chunian, Jacobabad and Nayachor. Overall, IAF struck eight air bases like Sargodha, Rahimyar Khan, Chaklala, Rafiqi, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Murid and Bholari, with the runways being especially targeted in the first two. The runway at the Rahimyar Khan airbase, incidentally, is still not operational three months after the strikes.","The downing of a large pakistani aircraft in the air during operation sindoor was ""actually the largest-ever recorded surface-to-air kill by india"", air chief marshal a p singh said saturday.

We decided how we want to control the escalation. So, I want to make it very clear, there were no restrictions on us,"" the ACM added.The remarks are significant since the opposition has attacked govt on Operation Sindoor by latching onto some remarks made by India's defence attache to Indonesia, Captain Shiv Kumar, in a seminar there on June 29. He had said the IAF lost some fighters on May 7 because of the ""constraint"" given by the political leadership to target only the nine terror hubs and not attack Pakistan's military establishments and air defences on that day.The IAF chief, however, said ""full freedom was given to us to plan and execute"" the strikes. ""I must say that our attacks have been calibrated because we wanted to be mature about it,"" he said.There was a lot of planning and discussion among the chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan and the three Service chiefs, with national security advisor Ajit Doval also playing ""a very big role"" in getting all the forces and agencies together, ACM Singh said.After the Pahalgam terror massacre on April 22, it was decided the response could not be limited to the usual objectives. The aim this time was to strike not just the foot soldiers of terrorism, but the leadership infrastructure that sustained them, ACM Singh said.While seven targets close across the border were targeted by the Army, the IAF took on the main headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Muhammed in Bahawalpur that were further away.The two headquarters were hardened, well-defended structures, with the long-range strikes aimed at leadership residences, other housing for operatives and the spaces used for congregations and training, with a strict emphasis on minimising civilian casualties.This time there was also emphasis on getting video and other footage of the ""hits"" on different targets. The absence of such evidence during the air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 had led some quarters to doubt the claims at that time. ""So, I am very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot,"" ACM Singh said.","The opposition has attacked govt on operation sindoor by latching onto some remarks made by india's defence attache to indonesia.

ISLAMABAD: Stung by the IAF chief’s assertion, backed with photographs and video images, Pakistan swung into damage control, with its defence minister Khwaja Asif rejecting the statement that India had downed multiple Pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft in Operation Sindoor. Asif called the statement “implausible, ill-timed and a dangerous distortion of the May clashes”. He also claimed the IAF chief’s statement was made “to serve domestic politics”.In a statement on X, Asif claimed New Delhi was attempting to rewrite the narrative months after the fighting ended. “It is ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians,” he said.Asif said no such statement on Pakistani losses had surfaced for three months, while Pakistan had immediately shared “detailed technical briefings” with the international media.The minister insisted not a single Pakistani aircraft was destroyed. Instead, he claimed Pakistan’s forces had shot down six Indian jets, including advanced fighters, destroyed S-400 air defence systems, downed unmanned aircraft, and disabled “several Indian airbases”.“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure,” Asif said.","Iaf chief claimed india had downed multiple pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft in operation sindoor.

Hardly any collateral near Jaish-e-Mohammad's headquarters

NEW DELHI: Haunted by the ""ghosts of Balakot"", IAF chief Amar Preet Singh on Saturday came fully armed with more visual proof of the precision airstrikes carried out deep inside Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , showcasing the extent of damage inflicted on key military and terror infrastructure.From high-value airbases to the headquarters of ISI-backed terror outfits, the strikes, conducted in retaliation to the Pahalgam killings, demonstrated India’s ability to hit strategic targets with pinpoint accuracy, well inside enemy territory.""I'm very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot that we were able to tell the world what we have achieved,"" the IAF chief remarked.The evidence included images and videos of the destruction of Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi, the flattening of Jaish-e-Mohammed ’s command centre in Bahawalpur, and crippling damage to Lashkar-e-Taiba ’s headquarters in Muridke. The IAF also presented proof of severe hits on the Rahim Yar Khan, Sukkur, and Bholari airbases.The strikes inflicted a significant setback on Pakistan’s military capabilities by destroying the Nur Khan Airbase, a key pillar of the country’s air power, during precision strikes under Operation Sindoor.Located in Rawalpindi and formerly known as PAF Chaklala, the base served as the command hub of Pakistan’s Air Mobility Command.It housed critical aerial assets such as Saab Erieye airborne early warning aircraft, C-130 transport planes, and IL-78 aerial refuelling tankers.IAF's precision strikes under Operation Sindoor caused tremendous damage to Jaish-e-Mohammed’s headquarters in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, the ISI-backed terror group’s main command hub.Among those killed were ten members of JeM chief Masood Azhar’s family, marking a major blow to the group’s leadership.Carried out nearly 100 kilometres inside Pakistani territory, the strike was described as the most powerful of the operation, employing India’s most potent weapon.In total, the armed forces eliminated nine terror launchpads, but the Bahawalpur hit was considered the most significant for both strategic and symbolic reasons.Another key terror site that IAF had targeted was Muridke, where Lashkar-e-Taiba's headquarters was located.Demonstrating the level of damage caused by the strikes, IAF chief said, ""This is their senior leadership's residential area. These were their office building where they would get together to conduct meetings. We could get video from the weapons themselves as the location was within range.""The strikes killed around a dozen high-value terrorists in Pakistan, including IC-814 hijacker Yusuf Azhar, Lashkar’s Muridke chief Abu Jundal alias Mudassar, and the son of the 2016 Nagrota attack plotter.The damages at the Rahim Yar Khan airbase from Operation Sindoor was so intense that it remained non-operational for at least two months.The base, located about 230 km south of Bahawalpur, is a key element of Pakistan’s southern air defence due to its proximity to India’s Rajasthan border and was heavily damaged in India’s precision strikes in early May.Situated within an international airport, the airbase first issued a Notam on May 10, closing the runway until May 18, which was later extended. Another closure notice followed in early June, pushing the date to July 4.The image shows the before and after scenes at Sukkur Pakistani airbase. Its dual-use radar was targeted as it is located very close to Rajasthan and used for nefarious activities.At Bholari, strikes targeted the AEW&C hangar.""We attacked three hangars. One was the Sukkur UAV hangar, the Bholari hangar and the Jacobabad F-16 hangar. We have an indication of at least one AEW&C in that AEW&C hangar and a few F-16s, which were under maintenance there,"" IAF chief said.Singh on Saturday said the forces shot down five Pakistani jets and one airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft during the Operation Sindoor.
