BLA claims mass execution of 214 Pakistan train hijack hostages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bla-claims-mass-execution-of-214-pakistan-train-hijack-hostages/articleshow/119060439.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has issued a statement in connection with the train hijack incident, claiming responsibility for executing 214 hostages, alleging that Pakistan's refusal to negotiate led to their deaths. The BLA said the Pakistani forces ignored a 48-hour ultimatum for a prisoner exchange, resulting in the mass execution of only Pakistan security forces personnel.This is in sharp contrast to claims by the Pak army which claimed on Friday that 26 hostages were killed by the Baloch rebels who ambushed a train in Balochistan. The army acknowledged that only 18 of the slain hostages were army and paramilitary soldiers. However, this comes as no surprise, sources said, as ISI has been known to hide casualties on its side.In their statement, the BLA also acknowledged the death of 12 of its Mujahideen including five Fidayeen of the Majeed Brigade aka the suicide squad in the incident which it named as ""Operation Darra-e-Bolan "".The Baloch rebels accused the Pakistani military of attempting to misrepresent the situation and give details of its operation.""When the Zarar Company of Pakistani SSG commandos arrived to rescue the hostages locked in the bogies of the Jaffar Express, Fidayeen surrounded and attacked them fiercely. In this battle which lasted for several hours SSG commandos suffered heavy casualties while the hostages were also executed,"" the BLA said.","Baloch liberation army (bla) claims responsibility for executing 214 hostages.

NEW DELHI: A blast took place outside a temple in Amritsar around midnight when a person on a motorcycle threw an explosive device at it. The explosion damaged a part of the wall and shattered window panels, officials said on Saturday.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average pm2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) it was more than 25 times higher than who-recommended level and over three times more than indian ambient air quality standards.

SpaceX launched a fresh crew to the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday night, setting the stage for Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to return home after nine months in space.The new team—Nasa’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi, and Russia’s Kirill Peskov—blasted off from Kennedy Space Center aboard a SpaceX capsule as part of Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program. Their arrival, expected late Saturday, will allow them to replace the existing crew, including Williams, Wilmore, Nasa’s Nick Hague, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov. The transition will enable Wilmore and Williams to hand over operations before their scheduled departure next week, pending weather conditions.Wilmore and Williams originally launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner capsule in June for what was meant to be a short test mission. However, technical issues, including helium leaks and thruster failures, forced Nasa to delay their return, eventually deciding to bring them back on a SpaceX mission. Their homecoming was further postponed due to battery repairs on a new SpaceX capsule, prompting the agency to use a refurbished one to speed up the process.During their extended stay, Wilmore and Williams continued ISS maintenance, including fixing a toilet, watering plants, and conducting experiments. Williams also set a record for the most spacewalking time by a female astronaut.The delay became politically charged when President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed the previous administration had stalled the astronauts' return. However, Wilmore and Williams have consistently backed Nasa’s decision-making.With their return now imminent, both astronauts expressed excitement about reuniting with their families. Wilmore, a church elder, looks forward to resuming in-person ministry, while Williams is eager to walk her Labrador retrievers.“We appreciate all the love and support from everybody,” Williams said earlier this week. “This mission has brought a little attention … but I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we’re doing” with space exploration.","Nasa astronauts butch wilmore and sunita williams to return home after nine months in space.

"Only 388 Indian illegals in US verified, all back: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/only-388-indian-illegals-in-us-verified-all-back-govt/articleshow/119028170.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration.Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it's a million or a few thousand, there's no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of ""undocumented"" Indian immigrants residing in the US. ""The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,'' said junior external affairs minister Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in RS earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an ""unambiguous"" verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians.For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration.","India has identified 388 illegal indian immigrants in the us since president donald trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

Errol Musk on having child with Elon: 'Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to say no',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/errol-musk-on-having-child-with-elon-any-woman-with-slight-brain-would-be-mad-to-say-no-ashley-st-clair/articleshow/118807869.cms,"Errol on St. Clair: ‘A little crazy’ or the opportunity of a lifetime?

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Tech billionaire Elon Musk 's father Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.These remarks came as the woman, right-wing influencer Ashley St. Clair, filed a paternity lawsuit against Musk, seeking sole custody of their alleged child, born in September 2024. St. Clair claims that Musk has shown minimal involvement in the child's life, having visited only three times since the birth. Despite the controversy, the head of the US government's Department of Government Efficiency has neither confirmed nor denied St. Clair's claims.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding ashley st. clair's claim that she secretly gave birth to elon’s 13th child. “i would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118808243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1449611,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The red list

The orange list

The yellow list

.

The Trump administration is reportedly finalising a sweeping new travel restriction policy that could severely impact citizens from 41 countries. The proposal divides nations into three categories, each with varying levels of restrictions. Here's the full list of counties on the list.News of the policy, first reported by The New York Times, has caused widespread concern among prospective travelers and immigrants. Though still in draft form, the restrictions are expected to be finalised soon, as they stem from a January 20 executive order by President Trump, which gave the State Department 60 days to implement the ban. This means the policy could take effect within the next week.The ""red list"" includes Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bhutan. Citizens from these countries would be entirely barred from entering the US under the proposed policy.The ""orange list,"" which includes Russia, Pakistan, and Myanmar, would allow limited entry, with short-term non-immigrant visas available only after in-person interviews.The ""yellow list,"" mostly made up of African and Caribbean countries, would have 60 days to address security concerns. If they fail to comply, they risk being moved to the orange or red lists.Also read: Walled-off America: Trump travel restriction on 41 countries .. Trump's first travel ban, implemented during his first term, was challenged in court but ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court. It was later revoked by President Joe Biden, who called it a “stain on our national conscience.” However, Trump repeatedly vowed during his campaign to reinstate and expand the ban if re-elected.On his first day back in office in the second term, Trump signed an executive order reinstating travel restrictions, arguing that the measure was necessary to protect Americans from potential threats. ""We must safeguard our country from those who wish to harm us, exploit our immigration system, or spread hateful ideologies,"" Trump said in a statement.","Proposal divides nations into three categories, each with varying levels of restrictions.

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Wayne Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Steven Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Wayne Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Wayne Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

Donald Trump files emergency Supreme Court appeal after judges block birthright citizenship ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-files-emergency-supreme-court-appeal-after-judges-block-birthright-citizenship-ban/articleshow/118999901.cms,"ANI

The Trump administration in an emergency appeal on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to allow its plan to end birthright citizenship , arguing that lower courts overstepped by blocking the policy.Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth . Trump is now pushing for an emergency ruling to enforce his order in limited cases.In January, a federal judge declared Trump’s executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" preventing it from taking effect. Another judge in Maryland ruled that the order contradicts over 250 years of American law. Courts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington have all blocked the policy following lawsuits from over 20 states, immigrant rights groups, and individual plaintiffs.The Justice Department argued that nationwide injunctions have become excessive, preventing the government from enforcing a key immigration policy. It also accused past administrations of wrongly interpreting the Constitution, saying that birthright citizenship was never meant to apply to children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The administration believes this has encouraged illegal immigration.Signed on January 20—his first day back in office—Trump’s executive order aims to end automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders. The policy applies to births from February 19 onward and does not affect those already granted citizenship.According to ANI, Trump’s appeal does not ask the Supreme Court to decide whether the policy itself is constitutional. Instead, his lawyers are making a “modest” request to limit the scope of the lower court injunctions.The Supreme Court will likely schedule a briefing to hear arguments from those who oppose Trump’s order.",Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional.

Mark Zuckerberg's second meet after Donald Trump assumed office

Facebook-parent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House on Wednesday for meetings with Trump administration officials, Reuters reported. “Mark’s continuing the meetings he's been holding with the administration on American technology leadership,” Meta spokesman Andy Stone told the news agency, though he did not confirm the White House visit.Zuckerberg’s meeting comes just weeks after he made headlines for showcasing Meta’s advancements in artificial intelligence and the metaverse . Last month, the Facebook founder demonstrated the latest AI-powered features integrated into Meta’s platforms, emphasizing the company’s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation.The social media giant is reportedly testing its first internally developed chip designed for training artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Meta is partnering with Taiwan-based TSMC to manufacture the chip. Testing began after Meta completed its first “tape-out” - a critical phase in chip development that involves sending an initial design through a chip factory.This development holds much significance as the company joins other tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to create custom silicon and decrease dependence on external suppliers such as Nvidia.This is Zuckerberg’s second visit to the White House in two months. Last month, he met with officials to discuss Meta’s role in advancing U.S. technological leadership. Stone had then confirmed the February 6 visit, stating on X:“Mark Zuckerberg was at the White House today to discuss how Meta can help the administration defend and advance American tech leadership abroad.”Zuckerberg has been actively engaging with policymakers on AI regulations, digital infrastructure, and the role of U.S. tech firms in global competition.

Total lunar eclipse in the US: Timings and how to watch

What not to do during Blood Moon and Total Lunar Eclipse

Don’t Expect Instant Color Changes – The Moon won’t turn red all at once. The shift happens gradually as Earth's shadow covers it, so be patient.

Avoid Bright Lights – Streetlights, phone screens, and indoor lighting can make it harder to see the eclipse clearly. Try watching from a dark location for the best view.

Don’t Use Solar Eclipse Glasses – Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye. You don’t need any protective eyewear.

Don’t Rely Only on the Naked Eye – While you can see the eclipse without equipment, using binoculars or a telescope will enhance the experience by revealing more details.

Don’t Wait Until the Last Minute – Lunar eclipses last for hours, but the total eclipse phase is shorter. Know the exact timing so you don’t miss the Blood Moon at its peak.



Next lunar eclipse in 2025

A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late Thursday and early Friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a Blood Moon . This is the only lunar eclipse visible from the US this year and the first total lunar eclipse since November 2022. The entire event will last around six hours, with the best views expected across North and South America, though it will be visible throughout the Western Hemisphere.A total lunar eclipse happens when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align, causing the Moon to pass through Earth's darkest shadow. During this, the Moon takes on a reddish or copper hue, earning the name Blood Moon. This color change happens because sunlight filters through Earth's atmosphere, projecting the colors of sunrises and sunsets onto the Moon.The eclipse begins with a penumbral phase at 11:57 PM EDT (8:57 PM PDT) Thursday. The partial eclipse starts at 1:09 AM EDT (10:09 PM PDT) Friday, making it look like a ""bite"" is taken out of the Moon. The most dramatic phase, totality, occurs at 2:26 AM EDT (11:26 PM PDT) Friday, when the Moon will glow red. Totality ends at 3:31 AM EDT (12:31 AM PDT), and the eclipse fully concludes by sunrise.Unlike a solar eclipse, this event doesn’t require special glasses—just step outside and look up. A dark location away from city lights will offer the best view, and using binoculars or a telescope can enhance the experience. If the weather isn’t ideal, websites like Timeanddate.com will livestream the event starting at 1 AM EDT Friday.This month's full Moon, called the Worm Moon, will reach peak illumination at 2:55 AM EDT Friday and will appear full for three nights. The name comes from the Maine Farmers' Almanac, which documented Native American names for full moons in the 1930s.The next total lunar eclipse will happen on September 7, 2025, visible from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The U.S. won’t see another total lunar eclipse until March 3, 2026.Looking ahead, the next solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, as a partial eclipse visible from multiple continents, followed by another on September 21, 2025.","A total lunar eclipse is set to light up the night sky late thursday and early friday, giving skywatchers a rare chance to witness a blood moon.

Trump's 18th century law for speedy deportations blocked by district judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-18th-century-law-for-speedy-deportations-blocked-by-district-judge/articleshow/119063973.cms,"Legal challenges for Trump

A federal judge gave a huge blow to the Trump administration’s deportation of Venezuelan gang members from the country, blocking the use of a centuries-old law to fast-track the crackdown.US district judge James E Boasberg issued the emergency ruling on Saturday evening, just hours after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify immediate deportations. The law, which has historically only been used during wartime, would have allowed the administration to bypass standard immigration proceedings.Boasberg intervened after learning that the government had already begun flying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador and Honduras under the order. El Salvador had agreed earlier in the week to accept up to 300 migrants deemed gang members by US authoritiesss.“I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” Boasberg said in court. He added, “a brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm.”The ruling came shortly after the president’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was mounting an ""invasion"" of the United States, posing a direct national security threat. His proclamation, issued just over an hour before the hearing, described the country as a “hybrid criminal state” that had lost control to transnational crime syndicates, including Tren de Aragua.The order, if enforced, would have given the administration unprecedented power to remove individuals it identified as gang members without court review. It also threatened to strip certain legal protections normally available to those facing deportation.The administration’s move triggered legal challenges, as the ACLU and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan migrants who feared imminent deportation.In response, Boasberg issued a temporary order on Saturday morning to halt their removal. The government appealed, arguing that preventing a president from acting before an order is even publicly announced would paralyse executive power.The justice department appealed that if the order were allowed to stand, ""district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint.”Boasberg later expanded his ruling to cover all migrants affected by Trump’s order, pausing deportations for up to 14 days and scheduling a follow-up hearing on Friday.During the hearing, deputy assistant attorney general Drew Ensign defended the order, arguing that Trump had the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua. He also referred a 1948 Supreme Court decision that allowed the US to continue holding a German national as an enemy alien years after World War II had ended.Tren de Aragua originated in a Venezuelan prison and expanded across South America as millions fled economic collapse in the country. While Trump made the gang a focus point of his immigration policy, formally designating it as a terrorist organisation last month, Venezuelan authorities claim that the group has been dismantled.","Us district judge james e boasberg issued the emergency ruling on saturday evening.

Watch: Serbia sees one of the largest anti-government protests over President Aleksandar Vucic’s 11-year rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-serbia-sees-one-of-the-largest-anti-government-protests-over-president-aleksandar-vucics-11-year-rule/articleshow/119062964.cms,".

A huge protest took place in Belgrade, marking the peak of more than four months of student-led demonstrations against President Aleksandar Vučić . It is the biggest challenge to his 11-year rule, which is accused of becoming increasingly autocratic.Hundreds of Vučić supporters, many dressed in black with matching backpacks, gathered in Pionirski Park, near the Serbian parliament. Local reports suggest that among them were members of organised football hooligan groups and veterans of the Red Berets, a special forces unit linked to the 2003 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjić.A large police presence separated the two groups. Near the state broadcasting headquarters, officers warned protesters to move, citing threats of an attack by pro-government groups.The protests began on 1 November after a newly renovated railway station in Novi Sad collapsed, killing 15 people. The incident exposed corruption and unsafe construction in a Chinese-led project, sparking public anger. The government was accused of covering up the disaster. Since then, students have led the movement, demanding honest governance and functional state institutions without corruption. They refuse to align with opposition parties, which they blame for enabling Serbia’s failing public sector.Ahead of the rally, Vučić escalated tensions, claiming that foreign intelligence agencies were behind an attempted coup.Vučić has also sought favour from Donald Trump. A Trump hotel is planned for Belgrade, and last week, Vučić gave an interview with Trump’s son, Don Jr. The younger Trump repeated the Serbian government’s claims that the protests were influenced by foreign money, calling them a “weaponised” movement aimed at causing a revolution.Authorities took steps that appeared aimed at limiting the protest’s size. Intercity trains were cancelled, officially for ""passenger safety,"" and some public transport services were suspended. But that didn’t stop people from coming. Convoys of cars, waving national flags and banners, flooded into Belgrade from all over Serbia. Farmers joined in with tractors, and hundreds of bikers rode into the city together, showing their support.The European Union and United Nations urged the Serbian government to respect the right to protest. Western governments have been cautious in addressing the demonstrations, as they seek to maintain ties with Vučić, hoping to pull him away from Russia’s influence.","Hundreds of vučić supporters gathered in pionirski park, near the serbian parliament.

Who backs Houthi rebels?

Major attacks by Houthis

At least 20 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Houthi-held areas in Yemen, reported news agency AFP.Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.The aerial strikes against the Yemeni rebel group came after Trump vowed to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" in the back of the Houthis' operations in the Red Sea.The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January amid the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Before the strike Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Houthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".""This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran ""axis of resistance"" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"" he added.The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, are a Zaidi Shia rebel group from northern Yemen, primarily based in Saada province. They emerged in the 1990s as a religious-political movement opposing Saudi-backed Sunni influence and Western interference in Yemen.The group was founded by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by Yemeni government forces, triggering an ongoing conflict. Though Zaidi Shia Islam is distinct from the Twelver Shia Islam of Iran, the Houthis have received military and financial support from Iran, leading to accusations that they serve as an Iranian proxy.The group gained global attention in 2014 when they took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and sparking a war with the Saudi-led coalition in 2015. Since then, they have engaged in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and recently, international shipping vessels in the Red Sea.Their attacks, particularly on Israel-linked ships, have drawn US and UK airstrikes in retaliation. The Houthis claim these actions are in support of Palestine, but their increasing aggression in the region has led to fears of wider conflict.Currently, they control much of northern Yemen, running a parallel government while continuing their fight against Yemeni government forces, Saudi Arabia, and UAE-backed militias.The Houthis primarily receive support from Iran, which provides them with weapons, military training, and financial assistance. Iran sees the Houthis as a useful ally in its broader strategy to counter Saudi Arabia and expand its influence in the region. The Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed group, has also reportedly provided military training and strategic guidance to the Houthis.In addition to Iran and Hezbollah, the Houthis have received support from various local tribes in Yemen, particularly those opposed to Saudi influence. Some reports suggest that North Korea has also secretly supplied them with weapons, though this is less confirmed.The Houthis claim to be fighting against Western imperialism, and in recent conflicts, they have aligned themselves with the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", which includes groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and various militias in Iraq and Syria.The Houthis have carried out several major attacks, disrupting global security and trade. In September 2019, they launched drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi oil production. In January 2022, they attacked Abu Dhabi with drones and missiles, killing three people and targeting an oil facility and the international airport.Throughout 2021-2022, they launched ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, including a strike on a Jeddah oil depot during a Formula 1 race. Since late 2023, they have attacked Red Sea shipping, claiming to target Israel-linked vessels, leading to US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions.In November 2023, they hijacked the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked ship, escalating tensions further. Their increasing use of advanced drones and missiles has turned them into a key regional threat.","Houthis, the militant group in yemen, has claimed that the us strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital sanaa on saturday.
