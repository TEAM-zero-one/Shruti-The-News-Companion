NEW DELHI: Following his historic mission to the International Space Station (ISS), Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla received a red-carpet welcome at Delhi’s IGI airport as he returned to the country from the US in the early hours of Sunday. Shukla, who piloted the spacecraft to the space station as part of the Axiom-4 mission, was welcomed by Union space minister Jitendra Singh, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and Isro chairman V Narayanan, and a large crowd of space enthusiasts at the airport.Posting on X later, minister Jitendra Singh said, “A moment of pride for India! A moment of glory for #ISRO! A moment of gratitude to the dispensation that facilitated this under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. India’s Space glory touches the Indian soil… as the iconic son of Mother India, Gaganyatri Shubhanshu Shukla lands at Delhi in the early hours of morning today. Accompanying him, another equally accomplished Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, one of the astronauts selected for India’s first Human mission Gaganyaan who was India’s designated backup for the mission to the ISS. Privileged to receive both of them”.Shukla is expected to meet PM Modi and then travel to his hometown Lucknow. He is likely to return to the Capital on Aug 22–23 to participate in the National Space Day celebrations.The Lok Sabha will hold a special discussion on Monday on India's space journey and Shukla's historic mission aboard the ISS, according to a notice issued by the lower House. The House will discuss “India's first astronaut aboard the ISS — critical role of space programme for Viksit Bharat by 2047”, which could possibly end the deadlock between the govt and opposition in Parliament over the electoral roll revision in Bihar.Earlier on Saturday, Shukla had posted a smiling photograph of himself on a flight and said he was filled with emotions. “As I sit on the plane to come back to India, I have a mix of emotions running through my heart. I feel sad leaving a fantastic group of people behind who were my friends and family for the past one year during this mission. I am also excited about meeting all my friends, family, and everyone in the country for the first time post mission. I guess this is what life is -- everything all at once,"" he said.In the 79th Independence Day speech at the Red Fort on Friday, PM Modi, while mentioning Group Captain Shukla’s successful mission to ISS, had said that India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector and preparing for the launch of Gaganyaan, its indigenous human space flight mission, and is also working on developing its own space station.In June, Shukla became the second Indian to go to space — after IAF wing commander Rakesh Sharma in 1984— as part of the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS. During the 18-day mission, Shukla, along with astronauts Peggy Whitson (US), Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski (Poland), and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), conducted more than 60 experiments and 20 outreach sessions aboard the ISS. He returned to the Earth on July 16.","Indian astronaut shubhanshu shukla received a red-carpet welcome at delhi’s igi airport as he returned to the country from the us in the early hours of sunday.

After a closely watched closed-door meeting in Alaska that lasted over 3 hours, US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin made their first public remarks — demonstrating both optimism and restraint about the future of bilateral relations and the conflict in Ukraine.The joint press conference, however, lasted only a few minutes.No deal was announced, and neither leader took questions.President Putin opened the joint news conference—an unusual move, as American presidents typically speak first when hosting foreign leaders.He took the opportunity to reflect on the deteriorating state of US-Russia relations, describing them as “fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.” Emphasising the need to shift from confrontation to dialogue, Putin declared, “Sooner or later, we have to amend the situation.” He called the meeting “long overdue,” underscoring the shared history of Russia and the US, especially poignant in the Alaskan setting.A centerpiece of their private discussions, according to Putin, was the situation in Ukraine. He expressed hope that “the Ukrainians and Europeans choose to not throw a wrench in” the peace process.Putin also thanked Trump for his “well-wishing tone,” noting the need for both sides to focus on tangible results. “Trump clearly cares about the prosperity of his nation. But understands Russia has its own interests,” Putin stated, positioning the dialogue as one of mutual respect and realism.President Trump began his statement on an upbeat note, describing the meeting as “very productive” and noting a considerable number of agreements reached.However, Trump acknowledged that several major issues remain unresolved. “A couple big ones where we haven’t quite gotten there, but we’ve made some headway,” he said.Reiterating his well-known negotiation mantra, Trump stated, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”He announced his intention to call NATO leaders and other key figures to update them on the meeting’s progress. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he said, would also be briefed. “It’s ultimately up to them. They’re going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who’ve come here,” Trump added, hinting at the broader coalition of voices involved in the process.While the meeting in Anchorage did not yield a definitive agreement, both leaders emphasised progress and the importance of continued dialogue.Trump’s decision to consult further with NATO and Ukrainian leadership signals that the path to resolution—especially regarding Ukraine—will require multilateral cooperation and careful negotiation.At the conclusion of the high-stakes Alaska summit between, Putin delivered a pointed parting remark, saying in English, ""Next time in Moscow"". This statement signals Putin's willingness to continue diplomatic engagements with Trump, potentially inviting the next meeting to be held on Russian soil.The Alaska talks, which lasted several hours, were seen by Putin as a diplomatic victory, allowing him to show resilience against Western isolation efforts following the Ukraine conflict.For Trump, the summit represented a moment to seek progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, with hopes of arranging further negotiations that might include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.As President Trump and President Putin depart Anchorage, the world watches for signs that optimism and engagement will translate into lasting progress. The message from both sides was clear: the door to peace is open, but it will take hard work—and consensus—to walk through.","Us president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin made their first public remarks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday [Friday in the US] faced an unexpected media encounter in Alaska, where reporters bombarded him with questions as he arrived for talks with US President Donald Trump on the Ukraine conflict.During the welcome ceremony, foreign journalists called out questions on issues ranging from civilian casualties to prospects for a ceasefire in the three-year-old war.One question -- “When will you stop killing civilians?” -- drew a gesture from Putin suggesting he could not hear. Another asked why Trump should trust his words. There was no clear response to whether he would agree to a ceasefire.Such open exchanges are rare at events attended by the Russian leader, where the travelling press pool is generally limited to state-approved reporters.Later, the two leaders sat side by side at a US base, flanked by their delegations against a blue backdrop reading ""Pursuing Peace"".While Putin appeared taken aback by a volley of simultaneous questions, Trump looked on.The reporters at the summit again called out queries, but this time, Trump offered only a ""Thank you very much"" before the press was escorted out.The Alaska meeting marks a rare in-person discussion between the US and Russian presidents amid ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, with both leaders under close scrutiny at home and abroad.Ahead of the summit, which could influence the war in Ukraine and relations between Washington and Moscow, Trump said that if the talks with Putin go badly, he ""would walk.""""I think it’s going to work out very well, and if it doesn’t, I’m going to head back home real fast,"" Trump said while talking to American news broadcaster Fox News.""If it doesn’t, you walk?"" Fox anchor Bret Baier asked. ""I would walk, yeah,"" Trump replied.The meeting gives Trump an opportunity to present himself as a negotiator who can help end the conflict in Ukraine, something he had assured he could do quickly after being elected to the White House.",Russian president vladimir putin faced an unexpected media encounter in alaska.

When that 45-day period after the elections is over and during that period, no candidate or political party finds any irregularity, then today, after so many days, the voters and people of the country understand the intention behind making such baseless allegations. ""On Congress leader's allegations that the Election Commission of India (ECI) provided his party with electoral rolls in formats designed to hinder scrutiny, including reams of printed paper stacked “seven feet high” and digital files locked as non-machine-readable PDFs, the CEC said, ""The machine-readable voter list is prohibited. This decision of the Election Commission is after the judgment of the Supreme Court and is from 2019. """"We have to understand the difference between a machine-readable voter list and a searchable voter list. You can search the voter list available on the Election Commission website by entering the EPIC number. You can also download it. This is not called machine-readable.

The machine-readable voter list is prohibited. This decision of the Election Commission is after the judgment of the Supreme Court and is from 2019...""Neither the EC nor the voters are scared of ""baseless allegations"" of double voting and ""vote chori"", Kumar asserted.The comments come as the Opposition stepped up its attack against the poll roll revision in Bihar and on the allegations of ‘vote chori’ raised by Congress.The CEC sais Rahul Gandhi should either give a declaration under oath within seven days on his allegations of irregularities in the voter list. ""If no declaration under oath given within 7 days, claims will be considered baseless and invalid…,"" he said, adding that those making unfounded allegations should apologise to the nation.Meanwhile, Congress party responded to CEC's presser saying, ""If Election Commission had done its job, then how did Rahul Gandhi meet those people who were declared dead?… The 2003 SIR was conducted in August, but it took a year. They now want to complete in 1.5 or 2 months.""""Did he give any response about the 1 lakh voters we exposed in Mahadevapura... We had hoped that today he would answer our questions...

At present, the NDA holds a numerical advantage.The combined strength of the two Houses is 786, factoring in six vacancies — one in the Lok Sabha (Basirhat, West Bengal) and five in the Rajya Sabha (four from Jammu and Kashmir and one from Punjab, where AAP MP Sanjeev Arora resigned after winning a state assembly bypoll).A candidate needs at least 394 votes to win, assuming full participation. The NDA is well placed, with 293 MPs in the 542-member Lok Sabha and 129 MPs in the 240-member Rajya Sabha (effective strength), including support from nominated members.This gives the ruling alliance an estimated total of 422 votes, comfortably above the required majority.Under Article 68(2) of the Constitution, an election to fill a vacancy in the office of the vice president due to resignation, death, removal, or any other reason must be conducted ""as soon as possible."" The elected person serves a full five-year term starting from the day of assuming office.The election is held by proportional representation through a single transferable vote and conducted by secret ballot, as stated in Article 66(1). Members rank the candidates in order of preference. The vice president is India’s second-highest constitutional authority and also functions as the ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.Former vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar, 74, had resigned from his post on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons. In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu posted on the vice-president's official X account, he wrote, ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as the Vice-President of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution.""The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the election of the vice-president of India.

The bench posted the Centre's application for hearing on Monday.The Punjab govt had complained that the bills passed by the assembly two years back - The Sikh Gurdwaras (Amendment) Bill, 2023, and The Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023 - have been kept in limbo by the President after the governor arbitrarily referred these to her.The state challenged ""the governor's referral of the two bills to the President of India for her consideration in contravention to the aid and advice of the council of ministers in the absence of any constitutional trigger or any extraordinary breakdown of democratic governance."" It also challenged ""the President's inaction on both the bills"" and said as per the Apr 8 judgment, she has to provide reasons for refusing assent or withholding assent.The Sikh Gurdwaras (Amendment) Bill, 2023, mandates the board constituted under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, to propagate teachings of the Gurus by making uninterrupted live feed of the holy Gurbani from Sri Harmandir Sahib available to all media houses, platforms, channels etc. free of cost, and restrains anyone broadcasting the Holy Gurbani from telecasting any advertisement 30 minutes prior to and after the broadcast.The Punjab Police (Amendment) Bill, 2023, seeks to amend the Punjab Police Act, 2007, to create an independent mechanism for selection and appointment of suitable persons to the post of Director General of Police (DGP).

BJP Hits Out at Congress for Spreading Lies, Creating Anarchy Over EC Row

Articles 200 and 201 envisage that the President will apply his/her own mind to decide whether to assent or withhold assent, and these provisions do not mention any role of Supreme Court under Article 143.

Such a proposition presupposes that only the judiciary can decide questions related to the Constitution, whereas the Constitution contemplates that the legislature, the executive and the judiciary each is competent and authorised to interpret the Constitution within their own domain. The legislature considers the constitutionality of a bill during debate, the President or governor applies their mind while deciding whether to withhold, assent or refer a bill and the judiciary decides the legality of an Act in appropriate proceedings.

Such a proposition converts a constitutional prerogative into a judicial mandate in the nature of a continuing mandamus, which is impermissible.

NEW DELHI: Objecting to the judgment mandating the President to seek Supreme Court's opinion on constitutionality of bills, Union govt has said the judiciary cannot dictate to the President how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion and on which issues.Faulting the April 8 judgment of a bench of justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan, the Centre, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, said a plain reading of the President's powers under Article 143 ""shows that an absolute discretion lies with the President to seek advice. The term 'consult' means the act of asking for advice and indicates that the President is not bound to do so"".The judgment had advised the President that whenever a governor reserves a bill for her consideration on the ground that it is patently unconstitutional, the President ought to make a reference to SC under Article 143 ""as a measure of prudence"", given that it is for the apex court to determine the constitutionality and legality of orders and laws.Ahead of Tuesday's hearing on the Presidential Reference before a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai, the Centre said, ""Any constitutional proposition of law that there exists a constitutional expectation for the President to refer every reserved bill to the Supreme Court is contrary to the constitutional scheme"". It gave three reasons to repudiate the SC bench's proposition to this effect:Union govt said the Constitution does not empower the judiciary to examine the contents of a bill that is yet to become a legislation, sans assent granted by a governor or the President.""The constitutional courts cannot undertake judicial adjudication over the contents of a pending bill. It is not possible for the constitutional courts to look behind the contents of the bill at a stage wherein it is a pending decision before the governor and adjudicate whether it requires a reference to the President or not,"" it said.It further said a state is barred from filing petitions under Article 32, which is a preserve of citizens to seek redress of violations of their fundamental rights by directly approaching the SC. For any dispute between the state and the Centre, the parties concerned need to approach the SC through a suit under Article 131.The Centre held, ""A state govt cannot file a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution against essentially the governor of the state...""","Union govt says the judiciary cannot dictate to the president how and when to exercise her unfettered discretion to seek the apex court's opinion.

From Nehru's kinship to Modi's firepower: India shifts tone on Pak,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-nehrus-kinship-to-modis-firepower-india-shifts-tone-on-pak/articleshow/123351495.cms,"NEW DELHI: ""Our neighbour is Pakistan, which is a part of us, part of our hearts and arms. How do we even think of fighting them? This is like harming ourselves. And, if they are aggressive, they will harm themselves. This is a strange relationship between India and Pakistan. Strange relationship where there is sorrow and anger but ultimately that relationship is so close and for thousands of years that laws can't eradicate it. And, if something harms India, it will definitely harm Pakistan as well,"" Jawaharlal Nehru told the nation from the Red Fort in 1957 on Independence Day.Nearly seven decades later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday struck a markedly different note.Signalling no rethink on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) under present circumstances, he declared that India will not distinguish between terrorists and their sponsors, pointing directly at Pakistan's leadership.Prime Minister Modi underlined that the country would not succumb to ""any sort of nuclear blackmail.""""The Indus Waters Treaty was an injustice to the people of India. The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water.Now, the right over India's share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers' interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore,"" he said. Modi added, ""India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the armed forces will give them a befitting reply. India has decided that blood and water will not flow together.""Recalling last month's strikes, Modi said, ""Operation Sindoor was the expression of that outrage... Penetrating hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory, they reduced terrorist headquarters to dust... Pakistan is still sleepless.""This stark contrast captures the transformation in India's attitude towards Pakistan. PM Modi's language of deterrence and retaliation has replaced the earlier vocabulary of kinship and restraint. From invoking Balochistan, Gilgit and PoK in his 2016 speech to citing deep-penetration strikes in 2025, his addresses reflect a conscious break from decades of what he has called misplaced sentimentality.By comparison, the Nehruvian era was shaped by reconciliation despite provocations. Nehru's framing of Pakistan as inseparable from India's ""heart and arms"" translated into policies like the IWT and territorial concessions under the Noon-Nehru Pact. Even in the face of aggression, he sought to preserve ties.Indira Gandhi's decisive 1971 victory did not fundamentally alter that mindset. Returning 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, according to experts, without securing a settlement on Kashmir reflected a continued view of Pakistan as a ""brother"". Rajiv Gandhi's Independence Day speeches largely bypassed Pakistan, centring instead on domestic modernisation.Even after terror struck deep, restraint prevailed. In 2009, less than a year after the 26/11 attacks, Manmohan Singh's address spoke only of honouring ""special assurances and concessions provided to J&K"" - a line that avoided naming Pakistan directly. From Nehru's fraternity to Modi's firepower, the arc of Independence Day speeches reveals how India's strategic outlook on Pakistan - and China - has hardened from conciliatory sentiment to hard-nosed realism.","Prime minister narendra modi on friday struck a markedly different note.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016.

Dave Portnoy’s viral critique and Whitlock’s blunt agreement spark fan arguments

Box-office success versus cultural reception and why the discourse won’t die

One of Hailee Steinfeld ’s biggest releases, the Ryan Coogler–directed horror hit Sinners, keeps pulling headlines for everything except its box-office clout. Despite crossing $350 million worldwide, the film drew fresh heat when Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy blasted it on social media, prompting Jason Whitlock to pile on with a curt, three-word takedown.Dave Portnoy didn’t mince words while criticizing Josh Allen's wife Hailee Steinfeld's recent movie Sinners. “I may be like 6 months late with this critique, but that was one of the most overhyped, overrated movies of all time. If you say that movie was great you have no movie credibility with me.” Within moments, former ESPN and Fox Sports personality Jason Whitlock co-signed the sentiment with a minimalist dunk: “Fact check: true. ”The exchange instantly split timelines. Supporters echoed Portnoy’s view that Sinners leaned on style over substance; others argued the film’s mood, performances, and world-building were precisely what made it resonate with audiences. The numbers and accolades, back that up: in June 2025, IndieWire ranked Sinners No. 65 on its “The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far)” list, and Steinfeld took home Best Supporting Actress at the 2025 Astra Midseason Movie Awards.Sinners is a classic case of a movie living two lives—one at the ticket window and another in the court of public opinion. Ryan Coogler’s signature craft and star power (with Michael B. Jordan featuring) helped the film travel, but its grim tone and genre-bending choices clearly aren’t for everyone. That friction, critical lists versus contrarian pundits, keeps the conversation hotter than most horror titles enjoy months after release.Sinners premiered on April 3, 2025, at AMC Lincoln Square in New York City, and was theatrically released in United States on April 18, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and grossed $365.9 million worldwide.Steinfeld gained wider recognition for her roles in the Pitch Perfect film series (2015–2017) and The Edge of Seventeen (2016), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination.Also Read: “Overhyped and overrated”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld faces harsh criticism from Dave Portnoy Away from the noise, newlyweds Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld, married in May, were recently spotted shopping in California as Buffalo eyes a deep run.

W hen Jacksonville Jaguars star Travis Hunter tied the knot with longtime love Leanna Lenee in May 2025, their wedding in Chattanooga, Tennessee, seemed like a fairytale moment. The two had been together since Hunter’s high school days in Georgia and got engaged in February 2024. But just days after their ceremony, the couple found themselves at the center of online gossip — all thanks to a small tattoo and an even smaller social media snapshot.It began when a photo of Leanna Lenee hugging Travis Hunter from behind started making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter). The image appeared to show a “$” tattoo inked on her ring finger. Some fans quickly jumped to conclusions, suggesting the symbol hinted at materialistic intentions.One commented, ""And she’s legit disgusting. He’s a young kid… it’s sad."" Another user commented, “Can’t say there wasn’t signs..”, while another added, “What a million dollar mistake looks like.” Others took a harsher stance, claiming, “If anything happens, it’s his fault for being blinded by love (lust).”The speculation piled on top of earlier viral chatter from their wedding day, when a clip seemed to show Lenee dodging a kiss during their first dance — a moment critics eagerly dissected.Despite the online noise, neither Hunter nor Lenee addressed the rumors. But former NFL MVP Cam Newton took the opportunity to publicly back the newlyweds. Speaking on his 4th & 1 with Cam Newton podcast, he said: “Congratulations to the Hunters. You know his wife, LL Cool J. She cool. She has been a punching bag, and it’s unfortunate… But guess what, baby, who’s laughing now?
