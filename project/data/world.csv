NEW DELHI: A day after controversial statements on Supreme Court and Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey targeted former chief election commissioner S Y Quraishi , labelling him a ' Muslim commissioner '.The incident occured following Quraishi's criticism of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which he described as a 'sinister and evil plan of the government to grab Muslim lands.'On April 17, Quraishi posted on X: ""Wakf Act is undoubtedly a blatantly sinister evil plan of the govt to grab Muslim lands. I'm sure SC will call it out. Misinformation by the mischievous propaganda machine has done its job well.""Responding on Sunday, Dubey accused Quraishi of facilitating Bangladeshi infiltrators' voter registration in Jharkhand's Santhal Pargana during his tenure. ""You were not an election commissioner, you were a Muslim commissioner. The maximum number of Bangladeshi infiltrators were made voters in Santhal Pargana in Jharkhand during your tenure,"" he wrote on X.""Prophet Muhammad's Islam came to India in 712. This land (Waqf) before that belonged to Hindus or tribals, Jains or Buddhists associated with that faith. My village, Vikramshila, was burnt by Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1189. Vikramshila University gave the world its first vice-chancellor in the form of Atish Dipankar,"" added Dubey, who currently serves his fourth term as Lok Sabha representative from Godda, Jharkhand.He concluded by stating: ""Unite this country, read history; division created Pakistan, and there will be no more partitions now, will there?""This incident occurred shortly after Dubey's controversial comments about CJI Khanna and the apex court, which led the BJP to dissociate itself from his statements. Dubey had said that the Supreme Court was 'inciting religious wars' and questioned its authority, suggesting that the Parliament building should be closed if the apex court was to make laws.""The top court has only one aim: 'Show me the face, and I will show you the law'. The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and State Assembly should be shut,"" Dubey told ANI.Referring to past decisions of the court, Dubey criticised the judiciary for its handling of issues like the decriminalisation of homosexuality and religious disputes. ""There was an Article 377 in which homosexuality was a big crime. The Trump administration has said that there are only two sexes in this world, either male or female...Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, all believe that homosexuality is a crime. One fine morning, the Supreme Court said that we abolish this case...Article 141 says that the laws we make, the judgments we give, are applicable from the lower court to the Supreme Court. Article 368 states that Parliament has the authority to enact all laws, and the Supreme Court has the power to interpret the law.

The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Parliament makes the law of this country. You will dictate that Parliament?... How did you make a new law?

Taylor Swift gets called out as her fans criticise Blue Origin’s trip to space involving Katy Perry



Taylor Swift has not spoken about the Kanye West controversy it but has taken the legal route against him



Taylor Swift became a billionaire in 2023 and has constantly been in the news due to her work and personal life. While Taylor Swift has remained silent amidst the Kanye West controversy , the pop star has now found herself in a new controversy and is being heavily called out. Taylor Swift taking a private jet to places has always been in the news but now fans are not holding her back from calling her out due to the recent Blue Origin’s trip to space.A fan account of Taylor Swift’s took to X and posted a screenshot of the news around Blue Origin’s trip to space for 11 minutes which also had famous singer Katy Perry on it. The caption for the post reads as, “saving this for the next time I see someone complaining about Taylor’s jet”.The trip to space has already sparked major backlash but the post made by Taylor Swift’s fan account raised eyebrows and fans are now calling out the pop sensation.A fan commented, “this one being worse doesn’t make taylor’s okay. they’re both bad”, while another fan wrote, “The blue origin flights use liquid nitrogen and oxygen instead of fossil fuels to save environment. Private jets use fossil fuels.”A third fan commented, “They're both bad? One being worse doesn't suddenly cancel out the other. Always be critical of these things - billionaires aren't your friends. You can love Taylor Swift's music whilst criticising her actions and the systemic issues she perpetuates whole ALSO criticising this bs”Another user posted, “okay and? both aren’t any good. doesn’t matter who it is either way they’re both billionaires emitting a sh*t ton of harmful emissions. just because katy’s done so by a larger amount doesn’t mean taylor’s isn’t also still an insanely large amount.”A fifth fan noted, “reminder that we should get on all rich people for doing this!!”Taylor Swift taking her private jet for short trips, has constantly been criticised for a few years now, but the pop star has remained silent about it. Many have complained about how it is a “waste of resources” over the years, and it seems like Blue Origin’s trip to space has brought the issue back to discussion.At the moment, Taylor Swift is dealing with the Kanye West controversy, but has not issued a statement yet.For the unversed, Kanye West posted now deleted sexually inappropriate posts about the pop sensation.One of his posts read as, “Justin Bieber and Harry Styles f***ed Taylor Swift from both sides and didn’t call me.

Taylor Swift’s new era with Travis Kelce sparks questions about Joe Alwyn’s quiet exit

Taylor Swift has always been intentional about her narrative—every lyric, outfit, and public appearance has meaning. But since going public with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, fans have noticed something subtle yet striking: the virtual disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn from her recent storylines. Was this deliberate, or just the natural progression of moving on?Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years—her longest relationship to date. Though private, their romance heavily influenced several of her most emotionally resonant albums, including Folklore, Evermore, and parts of Midnights. Songs like “The 1,” “Invisible String,” and “Peace” were widely believed to be about the British actor. Yet since their split and her blossoming romance with Kelce, mentions of Alwyn have grown eerily scarce.Fans began to notice the shift during the international leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. As she introduced tracks from Midnights and updated setlists, her emphasis leaned more toward empowerment, growth, and joy—qualities many associate with her relationship with Kelce. The emotional depth of the Alwyn era seemed to fade into the background, replaced by sparkle, stadium anthems, and viral NFL appearances.Adding fuel to the speculation is Taylor Swift’s growing presence in sports culture, amplified by her relationship with Kelce. Her appearance at Chiefs games and Kelce’s cameos at her shows signal not just a relationship, but a cultural merge that’s being embraced by both fanbases. It’s a public evolution—and with it, perhaps, a quiet edit of what came before.While Swift has never directly commented on Alwyn post-breakup, her artistic choices may be doing the talking. Her newly released content and public appearances focus almost exclusively on the now—with Kelce prominently part of that picture.Whether Taylor is rewriting history or simply writing a new chapter, the shift is undeniable. Alwyn’s influence lives in her past work, but he no longer seems to have a place in the story she’s telling today.Also Read: The man behind Taylor Swift's love songs: Why Joe Alwyn’s influence may outlast Travis Kelce As Swift continues to evolve, one thing is clear: her legacy is hers to shape.

Trump's tattoo theory to prove MS-13 gang ties: What experts say about President's renewed focus on ink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tattoo-theory-to-prove-ms-13-gang-ties-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-what-experts-say-about-presidents-renewed-focus-on-ink/articleshow/120425771.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s tattoos explained — as conspiracy theories run wild

President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants , especially Venezuelans, drawing criticism from experts who say the practice is both flawed and misleading.Also read: Trump citing image of Gracia's hand to claim MS-13 connection Donald Trump recently invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a 29-year-old Maryland resident deported to El Salvador on March 15, despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. Sharing an image of tattooed knuckles allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump claimed: “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”.But multiple law enforcement officials and experts have warned against the Trump administration’s growing reliance on tattoos to determine gang affiliation — especially in the case of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua . “A tattoo itself is never sufficient evidence to prove a person is a member of a criminal group,” said Joseph Kenny, chief of detectives at the New York Police Department, according to a NYT report.Court documents and investigative reports indicate that US immigration officials are now using a 10-point scoring system under an internal guide — where gang-related tattoos can earn four points — to determine deportability under the Alien Enemies Act. Eight points are sufficient for expedited removal without a hearing. In one case, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist, was deported to El Salvador based solely on tattoos that read “Mom” and “Dad” inside crowns, according to a NYT report.While tattoos such as clocks, skulls, or train imagery have been linked to Tren de Aragua, five Venezuelan experts including police officials, academics, and a journalist told The New York Times that tattoos are not formal indicators of gang membership in Venezuelan street culture, where ink is common among young men regardless of affiliation.The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has further polarised debate. A New York Times video investigation debunked viral conspiracy theories that claimed his finger tattoos spelled out ""MS-13"" using a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull. ICE officials reportedly told The Washington Post that they were unaware of such symbols being used by the gang. However, an ICE arrest report cited other tattoos — including skulls with eyes, ears, and mouths covered (a “see no evil” motif) and a devil with horns as signs of seniority within MS-13. His Chicago Bulls cap was also cited as evidence, according to the NYT report.Despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the lower court’s order to reverse the deportation, the White House has remained firm. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” accusing him of gang ties.Meanwhile, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele mocked allegations of mistreatment, posting photos of Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with Senator Chris Van Hollen. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen,” he wrote on XLegal experts caution that even when tattoos are presented as evidence in court, they are rarely used as stand-alone proof. “A tattoo can be very telling. But are we going to base our decisions and law enforcement accusations and associations on a tattoo? Very, very unlikely,” said Ryan Brackley, assistant district attorney in Colorado’s Arapahoe County to NYTJohn Colello of the Los Angeles County DA’s gang homicide division agrees: “Facts and context are obviously important. Tattoos alone, or lack of tattoo, do not necessarily mean a person is, or is not, a gang member”","President donald trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants, especially venezuelans.

"MS 13 Tattoo: What is the truth of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's MS-13 tattoo, a photo that Trump shared?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-truth-of-kilmar-abrego-garcias-ms-13-tattoo-a-photo-that-trump-shared/articleshow/120442009.cms,"Donald Trump shows a photo of an MS-13 tattoo on Garcia's hand, the same that gets covered by emojis in a photo posted by his wife and is visible in another (right) photo.

What is the truth of the photoshopped photo?



Poll Do you believe that the photo shared by Donald Trump is indeed photoshopped? No, it's authentic. Yes, it's photoshopped.

What is MS-13?



Donald Trump has been accused of sharing a fake image of the knuckles Kilmar Abrego Garcia which shows MS-13 written on it. Social media users pointed out that the letters M, S and the numbers 1 and 3 are superimposed on the photo and those letters and numbers do not appear on any other photos of Garcia. Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported. When the Trump administration sent a number of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 members to Venezuela's notorious prison, Garcia was also sent along with them.In a court case, the Trump administration claimed that he was wrongly deported to El Salvador, following which the court ruled that he should be brought back. But now the White House has made it clear that the person is not coming back. As defense, the Trump administration said firstly the ball is in El Salvador's court as they will have to decide whether they would release their prisoner, which Salvador president Nayib Bukele denied. Secondly, the Trump administration released several pieces of evidence to establish that Garcia is an MS-13 member, and a criminal.The words M, S and 13 are not part of the tattoo and they were used in the photo that Trump shared to denote the meaning of the tattoo. On the knuckles of Garcia's four fingers on his left hand, there are tattoos of four symbols which stand for M, S, 1 and 3.“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the 78-year-old wrote.Another photo has gone viral in this context, in which those tattoos are hidden by love emojis posted by his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura.MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles, California, in the 1980s. Formed by Salvadoran immigrants fleeing civil war, it initially aimed to protect community members from other gangs. Over time, it evolved into a violent criminal organization. The name ""Mara Salvatrucha"" likely derives from ""mara"" (gang), ""Salva"" (Salvador), and ""trucha"" (street smarts), with ""13"" possibly indicating its alliance with the Mexican Mafia, as M is the 13th letter of the alphabet.","Kilmar abrego garcia is a maryland father who came to the us illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported. When the trump administration sent a number of tren de aragua and ms-13 members to venezuela's notorious prison, garcia was also sent along with them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120442104,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39552,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Patrick and Brittany Mahomes share adorable family photo fans can’t stop talking about



The Mahomes family is known for their picture-perfect moments, but this Easter, they truly delivered a heartwarming surprise that had fans gushing. On April 19, Brittany Mahomes shared a carousel of festive Easter snapshots on Instagram, offering a rare glimpse into their life as a family of five. The post, captioned “He is Risen🙏🏻✝️ Happy Easter🤍,” instantly became a fan favorite — and for good reason.While Patrick Mahomes and Brittany have had no shortage of adorable family highlights, it was the long-awaited appearance of their youngest child, Golden Raye, that stole the spotlight. The family, dressed in soft pastel tones, posed joyfully, but all eyes were on baby Golden, making her debut in the most endearing way. Clad in a sweet all-pink ensemble, she mirrored her older sister Sterling’s outfit, sending fans into a frenzy over their twinning moment.Randi Mahomes , Patrick’s mother, added a personal touch by commenting, “Happy Easter!! I love y’all,” while Patrick’s brother Jackson chimed in with, “BEST FAM!! Love you all!” The overwhelming love in the comments section reflected the affection fans hold for this wholesome NFL family.Since their high school sweetheart beginnings, Patrick and Brittany’s journey has been closely followed. They tied the knot in March 2022, and since then, their family has grown steadily — first with the birth of Sterling Skye in February 2021, followed by Patrick “Bronze” Lavon in November 2022, and most recently, Golden Raye on January 12, 2025.Though baby Golden was first teased to the world during the couple’s pregnancy announcement — where only her tiny feet were shown — her Easter debut marked the first time she featured in a full family photo. While her face hasn’t been revealed yet, the moment felt monumental for longtime fans who’ve watched the Mahomes family blossom over the years.This Easter celebration wasn’t the only recent family adventure. Earlier, the Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback took his loved ones on a Disney trip to Florida. From Bronze enjoying a front-row seat at Disney on Ice to Sterling’s cheeky side-eye at a Disney princess, the photos were both hilarious and heartwarming. Patrick even posed alongside Mickey Mouse — though Bronze didn’t seem quite as impressed.Brittany also took time to celebrate her best friend’s 30th birthday in a tropical getaway, sporting a stunning “golden hour” dress that subtly paid homage to her newborn daughter. But it was the Easter gathering, the first real family portrait featuring all three children, that truly resonated with fans.While Golden’s full reveal is still under wraps, her Easter cameo brought smiles across social media. As fans eagerly await more glimpses of the littlest Mahomes, one thing’s for sure — this growing family continues to charm the world, one photo at a time.Also Read: Why did Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce really disappear?

Emotional release, community healing, and voter mobilization were key outcomes

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets across the United States on Sunday in a fresh wave of anti-Trump protests , just two weeks after a similar nationwide mobilization. From Washington DC to San Francisco, the rallies were marked by a deep sense of urgency, anger, and fear over what protesters described as civil rights violations , executive overreach, and authoritarian tendencies under President Donald Trump.Although turnout in some cities like New York and Chicago was smaller than the April 5 protests, more than 700 events were organized, according to advocacy group 50501. The demonstrations spanned from Jacksonville, Florida, to Anchorage, Alaska, making it one of the most widespread waves of protests since Trump returned to political prominence.More than 700 events were registered under the 50501 campaign, making Saturday’s protest one of the largest decentralized demonstrations against Trump since 2017.While crowd sizes were smaller than the April 5 protests in some major cities, organizers highlighted the geographic spread as the true measure of momentum. Protests took place in small towns like Bisbee, Arizona, all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, where demonstrators braved freezing temperatures to raise signs reading “Democracy Not Dictatorship.”In Washington DC, protesters gathered in front of the White House and marched to the Department of Homeland Security to decry the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man sent to El Salvador despite a court ruling allowing him to stay.Activists chanted “Shame!” and waved upside-down American flags. “It feels like we’re past the Constitution,” said Elena Rodriguez, a DC resident and immigration rights advocate.Abrego Garcia’s case was cited in dozens of rallies across the country as emblematic of what critics call lawless deportation practices. In Chicago, protesters handed out flyers with Garcia’s face, labeling him “the canary in the coal mine.” Julia Fine, a Brooklyn resident, said, “The Salvadoran prison he’s in now is like Guantánamo without the cameras. This is what happens when executive power goes unchecked.”In New York City, hundreds gathered in Washington Square Park holding signs like “First they came for the immigrants…” and “No ICE in our state.” The atmosphere was tense but resolute. “I’m a citizen,” said Aaron Burk, “but the way things are going, anyone who looks like me is fair game.” Speakers warned of a growing network of unaccountable immigration enforcement, including unauthorized raids and surveillance.In Jacksonville, Florida, demonstrators condemned both the rollback of LGBTQ+ rights and the Trump administration’s decision to weaken the Endangered Species Act. “This isn’t just about one community,” said Sara Harvey, who held a rainbow flag and a cardboard cutout of a sea turtle. “They’re cutting protections for people and the planet.” The protest also drew attention to job cuts in the Department of Interior and Education, blamed on Trump’s alliance with business leaders like Elon Musk.Some rallies specifically targeted Tesla dealerships and SpaceX offices, symbolically linking Elon Musk to Trump’s push for a smaller federal government. Protesters in Austin, Texas, and Palo Alto, California, accused Musk of enabling federal downsizing that resulted in job losses across education, science, and public welfare sectors. “He’s playing kingmaker while people lose their livelihoods,” said Tanya Boon, a former EPA worker.In Chicago’s Daley Plaza, speakers emphasized how proposed Trump policies could dismantle key social programs. Signs read “Hands off Social Security” and “Veterans deserve better.” Fio Holloman, a 22-year-old protester, said her father—a Vietnam vet—recently lost a disability benefit. “It’s not just about Trump the man. It’s about Trumpism as policy,” she said.In Concord, Massachusetts, site of the Revolutionary War’s start 250 years ago, what began as a historical reenactment turned into a symbolic protest. Activists held signs reading “Stop Fascism Now” and “No Kings, No Trump.” Marchers dressed as 18th-century patriots drew comparisons between King George III and Donald Trump. “Our forefathers fought tyranny—why wouldn’t we?” said Mark Aldrich, a local historian turned protester.At Boston Common, hundreds rallied with signs condemning Trump’s alleged disregard for court rulings and checks on executive power. George Bryant, a teacher, said: “This is what fascism looks like: targeting students, flouting the courts, and threatening free speech.” One speaker called for the Justice Department to “intervene before it’s too late.”Beyond policy demands, many protesters described the day as emotionally necessary. In Cincinnati, Mayor Aftab Pureval joined the crowd and led chants of “Vote them out!” Social worker Andrea Mallory described the protest as “group therapy.” “I came here to scream. To grieve. To remember I’m not alone,” she said. Organizers handed out voter registration forms and “Know Your Rights” guides.","Thousands of people across the united states took out rallies opposing several contentious schemes of the current trump administration.

Somewhat concerned Very concerned

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi mocked BJP leaders as ""tubelights"" on Sunday, following controversial remarks by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India.Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.""You people (BJP) are tubelights... Do you even know what Article 142 is? It was framed by Dr. BR Ambedkar,"" Owaisi said, accusing the BJP of threatening the judiciary with religious warfare.You people are in power and have become so radicalised that you're now threatening the court with a religious war. Modi ji, if you don't stop these people, the country will become weak. The country won’t forgive you, and tomorrow, you won’t be in power,” he added.This comes in response to Nishikant Dubey’s comments suggesting that Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like a law-making body.Taking aim at the Supreme Court, Dubey said, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan band kar dena chahiye” (If the Supreme Court is going to make the laws, then the Parliament should be shut down).Targeting the Chief Justice of India, he added, “Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.”Echoing similar sentiments, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “There is an apprehension among the public that when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote the Constitution, the roles of the Legislature and the Judiciary were clearly defined. According to the Constitution, no one can direct the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the President has already given her assent to the law. No one can challenge the President, as the President is supreme…”These remarks come at a sensitive time, as the Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which was passed by Parliament in early April.In response to the court’s concerns, the Centre has agreed to temporarily hold off on implementing certain controversial provisions of the law until the next hearing.Meanwhile, the BJP has “outrightly rejected” and distanced itself from the remarks made by its MPs, and members have been cautioned against making such statements in the future.“The statements made by BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Dinesh Sharma regarding the judiciary and the Chief Justice have no connection whatsoever with the Bharatiya Janata Party . These are their personal views. The BJP neither agrees with nor endorses such statements. The BJP outrightly rejects them,” BJP national president J.P. Nadda said in a post on X.“The Bharatiya Janata Party has always respected the judiciary and has wholeheartedly accepted its orders and suggestions. As a party, we believe that the Supreme Court, along with all other courts in the country, is an integral part of our democracy and a strong pillar in safeguarding the Constitution. I have directed both of them—and everyone else—to refrain from making such statements,” he added.","Owaisi reminded the bjp of article 142 of the constitution, which grants the supreme court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.

What the Kardashians said about Lauren Sanchez’s Blue Origin space flight



“This is a really unique experience and we’re just so honored to be here to support them and watch this amazing part of history, and I’m so proud of her,”

How Sanchez solved NASA's 'uniform problem' before her Blue Origin flight



Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, received a space-themed gift from Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Khloé Kardashian after her recent Blue Origin Space flight. The Kardashians gave Sanchez a Judith Leiber handbag shaped like an UFO, valued at $6,995. The UFO Orbiter bag features star-shaped and geometric crystals, aligning with the theme of the Blue Orgin's Space flight. Sánchez shared the gift on her Instagram story (seen by Page Six), describing it as “Out of this world!” and tagged the three Kardashian sisters. The gift came shortly after this week’s all-women Blue Origin space flight, which Sánchez helped organise alongside Bezos through his Blue Origin initiative.Kris Jenner and Khloé Kardashian traveled to Van Horn, Texas, earlier this week to support Lauren Sánchez as she took part in an all-female Blue Origin space flight.Jenner said about Sánchez.Khloé Kardashian also shared her thoughts, saying the family is proud of “all of the female astronauts,” referring to the rest of the crew that included: Katy Perry, Gayle King, Aisha Bowe, Amanda Nguyen and Kerianne Flynn.Ahead of her Blue Origin flight, Sánchez emphasized the importance of designing better-fitting spacesuits for women. Collaborating with designers Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim, Sánchez helped develop a suit specifically designed for women, addressing a long-standing issue where space suits were originally made for men and later adapted.Her efforts align with Blue Origin’s focus on inclusive design and follow a 2019 incident where NASA cancelled an all-female spacewalk due to a lack of properly fitting suits.","Kris jenner, kim kardashian, and khloé kardashian gave lauren sánchez a $6,995 handbag shaped like an ufo.

They have no school to go to since the Israeli military ordered residents to leave the Jenin refugee camp more than two months ago.Mohammed Shalabi, a 53-year-old father who is among several hundred Palestinians sheltering at the university campus in Jenin city, recalled the day he heard that special Israeli forces were inside the camp.""Everyone knows that when the army enters, it destroys the infrastructure, even the cars,"" said the municipal worker.Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced from the northern West Bank since Israel launched the offensive dubbed ""Iron Wall"" on January 21 in the area.Shalabi first left Jenin camp for nearby villages before authorities offered accommodation at the now vacant premises of the Arab American University , one of the leading institutions in the West Bank.Shalabi said he has avoided ""discussing all of this"" with his 80-year-old father to protect his fragile health.""But he understands, and sometimes he cries, because he lived through the Nakba, and now this..."" said Shalabi, referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the war that accompanied Israel's creation in 1948.Now forced to leave their homes in the Jenin refugee camp, residents fear a repeat of the collective trauma they inherited.The United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, provides aid but recent Israeli legislation barring coordination with Israeli military authorities has complicated its work.The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the West Bank, lacks the funds to help.Many international organisations are already focusing much of their efforts in the Gaza Strip, a separate Palestinian territory where the Israel-Hamas war since October 2023 has created a dire humanitarian crisis.""No one is interested in what's happening here,"" said a social worker who often visits the displacement shelter at the university to hand out blankets, food or grocery money.Public services like rubbish collection are rare or virtually non-existent. Many displaced residents have asked for a temporary school to be set up for the children but to no avail.Most shops are closed, and the nearest supermarket is a 20-minute walk away.All the while, Israeli army bulldozers operate in the Jenin camp, leaving behind a trail of destruction.""They told us we no longer have a home, and that we won't be returning to the camp,"" said displaced resident Umm Majd.Some camp residents who attempted to go back say they were turned away.In early March, an UNRWA official spoke of growing concerns that ""the reality being created on the ground aligns with the vision of annexation of the West Bank.""The new, makeshift camp has come into being on the university campus in what appears like a dystopian landscape.The campus buildings carry names that give them an international and prestigious air, like Casa Bella, Concorde and Dubai.But many of them, not long ago busy with students, are abandoned.Others have become home to families of the displaced who now cram into tiny studio apartments that served as campus housing.The families cook on gas stoves and sleep on foam mattresses that have to be put away every morning to create space.""We have 20 percent of the life we had in the camp,"" said Umm Majd, sharing a two-person room with three others.Farmers bring goats to graze in fields around the campus.Many of the students that used to fill the university halls and dorms before the Gaza war were Palestinian citizens of Israel, who generally stopped crossing into the West Bank for their studies.Eateries in the area are either closed down or being refurbished, the sign of economic hardships across the West Bank that have worsened throughout the Gaza war.""We live day by day. There's no outlook because of the lack of work and resources,"" said Ahmad Abu Jos, 30.His baby boy Mustafa is learning to walk in the tiny apartment space, filled with the smell of detergents and cooking.The boy's mother, Rama Abu Jos, said: ""We left the camp, but not of our own free will. We hope to return home. No one likes life here.""","Tens of thousands of palestinians have been displaced from the northern west bank.

Gunmen launched a violent attack on a Chinese-owned hydroelectric power plant under construction in southern Chile on Sunday, setting fire to dozens of vehicles and construction equipment.The targeted facility, the Rucalhue power plant , is being built by Rucalhue Energia Spa, a subsidiary of China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), with a projected investment of $350 million. It is located along the Biobio River, about 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Santiago.According to police chief Renzo Miccono, the armed attackers threatened security personnel before setting fire to the site. ""They proceeded to burn all the equipment there was at the site,"" he said.The assault led to the destruction of 45 trucks and five pieces of earth-moving machinery. Two security guards were injured during the incident.The comes amid the ongoing opposition from Indigenous communities that the project is facing.

"Thousands accessed sensitive White House info, floor plans under Biden and Trump admin: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/thousands-accessed-sensitive-white-house-info-floor-plans-under-biden-and-trump-admin-report/articleshow/120468746.cms,"More than 11,000 federal employees had access to sensitive documents, including White House floor plans and vendor banking information, due to a digital security lapse that spanned several years, according to a report by The Washington Post.The breach, which began during the administration of former President Joe Biden and also involved the current administration of President Donald Trump, involved at least 15 files stored in a Google Drive folder managed by the General Services Administration (GSA).Officials said the documents included potentially sensitive material such as proposed blast door designs for the White House Visitor Center and files marked as “controlled unclassified information” (CUI).The files were accessible to the entire GSA workforce — over 11,000 employees — and some were editable. The GSA has launched an internal investigation and a cybersecurity incident report is underway.The oversharing began in early 2021, during the tenure of former President Joe Biden, and continued until as recently as last week. Internal investigations and a cybersecurity incident report have since been launched.“This kind of mistake is a challenge across all administrations,” said Michael Williams, a Syracuse University professor who studies international security. “These are absolutely not documents you want shared with 11,200 people.”Although it’s unclear whether the East and West Wing floor plans were formally classified, experts say documents containing detailed layouts or embedded security infrastructure would normally be closely guarded. “Even if not formally classified, they would be restricted for obvious security reasons,” said Steven Aftergood, a former security policy analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.One of the earliest breaches occurred in March 2021 when a safety survey with East Wing blueprints was shared agency-wide. A similar incident followed involving the West Wing, which includes the Oval Office, Situation Room, and Cabinet Room. These files reportedly remained accessible for years.The GSA said it has protocols for detecting inappropriate file sharing, including automated scans and mandatory annual training. “Internal controls are not perfect,” a longtime employee told The Post. “But it’s not like we’re letting things happen unchecked.”Nine of the 15 files were marked as CUI — a designation for sensitive but unclassified material — and at least ten could be both viewed and edited by anyone within the agency. The breach included not only architectural blueprints but also courthouse layouts, project manuals, and financial records.The GSA’s Office of Inspector General uncovered the lapse during an audit of the agency’s Google Drive usage. The issue was flagged to the IT incident response team last Tuesday, and by Thursday, file-sharing permissions had been revoked. Investigators have so far been unable to reach the owners of the compromised files.According to WSJ, Neither the White House nor the GSA has issued a comment. A representative for former President Biden also declined to respond.This incident adds to a string of security missteps under both administrations. During President Trump’s tenure, officials mistakenly included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in a group chat discussing military planning and used personal Gmail accounts for sensitive communication. In contrast, a 2023 special counsel report criticised former President Biden for storing classified notebooks at his residence.Meanwhile, a separate controversy is unfolding at the Pentagon. US defense secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing classified airstrike plans in a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, according to The New York Times.The chat reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in US operations in Yemen. Unlike a previous leak in March — where a journalist was mistakenly added — the Signal group was reportedly created by Hegseth himself.This is the second time Hegseth has been accused of mishandling classified military information. The Pentagon inspector general is now investigating both incidents. Those in the Signal group reportedly include Hegseth’s wife Jennifer, a former Fox News producer; his brother Phil; and his personal lawyer Tim Parlatore.","The breach involved at least 15 files stored in a google drive folder managed by the general services administration. The documents included potentially sensitive material such as proposed blast door designs for the white house visitor center and files marked as “controlled unclassified information” (cui) the files were accessible to the entire gsa workforce — over 11,000 employees — and some were editable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120469482,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1099430,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

JD Vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of US Vice President with an unusually aggressive posture, stepping far beyond the ceremonial expectations of the office in his first 100 days. At just 40, the former Ohio senator has inserted himself into world affairs in ways few of his predecessors dared, quickly becoming the public face of President Donald Trump's most controversial foreign policy stances.“Vance is unfailingly loyal to the president, knows not to overshadow the boss, and acts as an attack dog,” said Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University. “But he also makes in-your-face comments that represent something of a departure from his predecessors.”Vance’s global profile exploded in February when he confronted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. As tensions simmered over continued US aid to Ukraine , Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful.“Have you said ‘thank you’ once, this entire meeting?” Vance demanded, calling the Ukrainian leader “disrespectful.” The moment quickly escalated as President Trump joined in, berating Zelensky in front of reporters.Vance later denied that the exchange was part of any coordinated plan to play “bad cop,” but the spectacle cemented his position as Trump's ideological bulldog on foreign policy.Since taking office, there has been speculation over which version of Vance would show up in Washington. Was he the Appalachian chronicler of Hillbilly Elegy, the Marine Corps veteran, the Yale Law School graduate, the Catholic convert, or the Silicon Valley investor?At one point, he was also a staunch Trump critic, comparing the former president to Adolf Hitler. But since entering politics, Vance has undergone a sharp transformation, aligning himself completely with Trump’s agenda and presenting himself as the ultimate MAGA loyalist.Vance’s first major foreign appearance came at the Munich Security Conference , where he delivered a strident address targeting what he described as Europe's ""woke"" culture and overreliance on US defense.“There’s a new sheriff in town,” he told startled allies, signaling that America’s foreign policy would now take a more confrontational and transactional turn under the second Trump administration .In a moment that revealed more than intended, a journalist was accidentally added to a Signal group chat discussing US airstrikes on Yemen’s Huthi rebels. In the conversation, Vance lamented, “I just hate bailing out Europe again,” criticizing US military involvement that he argued disproportionately benefits the EU.The leak, dubbed “Signalgate,” showed the vice president’s skepticism of traditional alliances and his preference for a nationalist, America-first approach.Adding fuel to another long-standing Trump fascination, Vance visited Greenland to lend credence to the president's renewed interest in purchasing the Danish-ruled territory. The trip was condemned as provocative by Denmark and NATO officials, but Vance defended it unapologetically.“We can’t just ignore the president’s desires,” he said during the trip, framing the visit as a gesture of loyalty to Trump’s geopolitical instincts.His wife, Usha Vance, made a rare public appearance during the visit, offering a glimpse into the personal toll of Vance’s high-profile role. “It’s a very lonely, lonely world,” she admitted in an interview, reflecting on the pressure and isolation that comes with the job.Vance has also drawn fire from Beijing for controversial comments about America’s debt dependence. In a speech, he claimed the US was “borrowing money from Chinese peasants,” a remark that triggered an official rebuke from China’s Foreign Ministry.Comparisons between Vance and former Vice President Dick Cheney are increasingly common. Like Cheney, who shaped George W. Bush’s foreign policy and championed the Iraq War, Vance is viewed as a central player in the Trump administration’s international strategy—particularly in pushing back against aid to Ukraine and resisting new US military engagements.Speculation is already swirling about Vance’s political future. He has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run but insists he would only move forward after consulting Trump.Trump, however, hasn’t endorsed the idea. “No,” the president told Fox News’s Bret Baier in February when asked if Vance was his chosen successor. “But he’s very capable.”In just three months, JD Vance has proven he is no placeholder. From confrontations with world leaders to unapologetic defenses of Trump’s most polarizing ideas, Vance is not only redefining the role of vice president—he’s auditioning for something bigger.Whether the world is ready for that remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: JD Vance is not here to wait in the wings.",Jd vance has taken on the traditionally subdued role of us vice president with an unusually aggressive posture.
