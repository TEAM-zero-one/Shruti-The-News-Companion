In what the government on Wednesday called a Diwali gift, the GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that daily-use items like hair oil, shampoo, toothpaste, soap, toothbrushes, and shaving cream will now attract just 5% GST, down from 18%.

The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.","Diwali gift for consumers: govt slashes gst across sectors, prices to drop from sept 22.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions, a development that comes close on the heels of his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“You cannot talk to India or China in that way,” Putting said, addressing the media after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit and a military parade in Beijing. “The colonial era is now over. They have to realise they can’t use these terms in speaking with partners.”The Russian President accused the Trump administration of using economic pressure as a tool to undermine two of Asia’s biggest powers. He also mentioned that he debriefed Modi on the Alaska summit with Trump during his one-hour car drive with the Indian PM.Putin said the US tariff regime was an attempt to “weaken the leadership of these countries”.“You have countries like India with 1.5 billion people, China, powerful economies, but they also have their own domestic political mechanisms and laws,” he said. “When somebody tells you they are going to punish you, you have to think — how can the leadership of those big countries react?”Putin said that history weighs heavily on the political instincts of both nations.“They had difficult periods in their histories too, like colonialism, tax on their sovereignty during a prolonged period of time. If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",‘india & china are not colonies’ putin roars; slams west’s sanctions and aggressive tone. ‘the colonial era is now over.

June phone call that changed the tone: Report



Operation Sindoor and the ceasefire claim



Tariff tantrums: From trade tariffs to a 50% wall





Tianjin optics: Putin’s limousine and Xi’s warm handshake



Oil at the centre of geopolitics



The China Plus One dilemma



Hedging, not aligning



A sinking boat or a reset ahead?



NEW DELHI: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood beside Donald Trump at Houston’s Howdy Modi event in 2019, it was more than just a diaspora spectacle. It was the visible embodiment of a strategic bet -- that personal chemistry between leaders could fast-track an alignment between the world’s largest democracy and its oldest.That narrative survived Trump’s turbulent first term and carried into his second, when PM Modi returned to Washington on 13 February 2025 for an official working visit that produced warm optics and a joint statement.But from there on, relations between the White House and Lok Kalyan Marg followed a deteriorating trajectory. The so-called ""ceasefire"" episode during Operation Sindoor, followed by Trump’s boastful claims of brokering a ceasefire in South Asia, dented trust. The rupture deepened with Washington’s tariff barrage on Indian exports and energy imports. What began as a handshake friendship risked descending into a transactional cold shoulder.By late summer 2025, Delhi and Washington were left to manage what diplomats called “the sinking boat of trade.” The tariff chapter is expected to hit Indian businesses hard, and Donald Trump’s demands for visible loyalty irritated policymakers in New Delhi.However, after the RIC (Russia–India–China) display at Tianjin during the SCO summit on 1 September 2025, there were signs that Trump’s tariff tantrums were moderating -- a signal that both capitals may still be looking for a revival, even as Delhi hedges with Moscow and Beijing.The first major rupture came on 17 June 2025, in a phone call between PM Modi and Trump. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump repeatedly claimed credit for de-escalating a flare-up between India and Pakistan -- a claim PM Modi did not endorse. Trump allegedly asked PM Modi to “acknowledge” his role publicly and even floated the idea of support for a Nobel Peace Prize. PM Modi’s refusal hardened Trump’s mood.The phone call was never officially confirmed in detail, but Indian officials hinted that “unnecessary self-congratulation” had strained the dialogue. For analysts, it marked the point where the personal rapport between the two leaders began to fray.The backdrop to that phone call was Operation Sindoor, India’s limited but high-visibility military action along the western frontier in early June 2025. New Delhi framed the operation as a targeted counter-terror response, but Trump publicly suggested the US had pressured both India and Pakistan into restraint -- an assertion dismissed in Delhi as exaggerated.Trump’s claim of having “secured a ceasefire” created domestic political unease for PM Modi. Critics accused him of allowing India’s sovereignty to be undermined by Washington’s narrative. While Indian officials tried to downplay the rhetoric, the perception that Trump was using South Asia for self-promotion lingered.Dr Ashok Sharma, Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy, speaking to Times of India, noted that “Donald Trump, in his first term, was not as blunt in his dealings with India, but in his current tenure he appears far more unpredictable and has moved away from the traditional Republican stance on New Delhi. Some experts even describe this shift as a ‘reverse Nixon’ move against India. ”What followed was harsher and measurable: tariffs. On 27 August 2025, Washington slapped Indian goods with up to 50% tariffs, citing unfair trade practices and New Delhi’s refusal to scale back Russian oil imports. The move stunned Indian exporters and undercut years of lobbying by US businesses who had invested in India as a “China Plus One” base.Indian officials called the decision “unjustified,” pointing out that India’s trade surplus with the US was far smaller than China’s and that Indian companies were still major buyers of American goods. More sensitive still was Washington’s explicit linking of tariffs to India’s Russian crude purchases. New Delhi defended its buying spree as an energy security necessity.The tariffs threatened a chilling effect: Industries ranging from textiles and pharmaceuticals to steel and IT services saw immediate cost spikes. Analysts warned that the penalties risked unravelling one of the few bipartisan achievements in US foreign policy -- strengthening ties with India to balance China.As Sharma explained, “Trump’s bluntness stems from India’s recent resistance to Washington’s attempts to dictate terms, seen in the Operation Sindoor episode and the ongoing tariff disputes. His aggressive posture has now expanded into a broader offensive against Brics nations, signalling a recalibration of US foreign policy priorities.”The SCO summit in Tianjin on September 1 provided the clearest demonstration of how Delhi was recalibrating. PM Modi held bilateral meetings with both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, emphasising long-term ties and regional cooperation.The images that dominated television screens back home in India were not of a wary handshake with Xi, but of PM Modi riding with Putin in his Aurus limousine after the summit -- a gesture of camaraderie choreographed for the cameras.Indian officials framed the meetings as pragmatic diplomacy. But the symbolism was unavoidable; after weeks of bruising tariffs from Washington, New Delhi was visibly embracing Moscow and engaging China in a multilateral setting.Energy has been the unspoken driver of this shift. Since 2022, when sanctions pushed Russian crude out of Western markets, India and China have emerged as Moscow’s top buyers. By mid-2025, discounted Russian oil accounted for nearly 40% of India’s crude imports. That cushion allowed Delhi to contain domestic inflation and keep refineries humming.For Washington, those purchases looked like undermining sanctions. For Delhi, they were a non-negotiable necessity. “We will buy where our people’s needs are met,” India’s petroleum minister told reporters in August 2025. The clash of perspectives turned energy into a wedge -- one that Russia and China exploited to court India more closely.For global business, the fallout has been stark. The “China Plus One” strategy -- moving some production away from China into other markets like India, Vietnam or Mexico took a hit as US tariffs made Indian exports less competitive. Companies that had invested in India expecting favourable access to the US market suddenly faced higher costs and uncertainty.Some Indian economists warned that the tariff shock could slow manufacturing growth just as India was positioning itself as a global alternative to Chinese supply chains. “If the US is unpredictable on tariffs, investors will think twice,” said one Mumbai-based economist.Sharma underlined that “foreign policy always depends on reliability as much as interests, and by tightening trade while demanding alignment, Washington exposed its unpredictability. For Indian policymakers, the message was clear: overreliance on the US carried risks. By alienating India, Washington achieved the opposite of its aim, nudging New Delhi and Beijing toward dialogue.”Despite the warmth in Tianjin, India’s strategy is not a wholesale pivot to Russia and China. Security tensions with Beijing remain unresolved after the 2020 Galwan clashes, and mistrust along the Line of Actual Control lingers. Defence cooperation with the US from intelligence sharing to the Quad partnership continues in parallel.What has changed is India’s willingness to publicly hedge. In September 2025, that hedge was displayed in three acts: Trump’s June 17 call; Washington’s 27 August tariffs; and PM Modi’s 1 September SCO appearances. Together they showed how quickly personal frictions and trade measures can spill into the strategic domain.The story of PM Modi and Trump in 2025 is not just about two personalities falling out. It is a case study in how transactionalism can undermine strategic trust. What began as the much-touted “bromance” of Houston now looks like a fragile arrangement tested by ego, tariffs and oil.Whether Delhi and Washington can patch the “sinking boat of trade” remains to be seen. With signs that Trump’s tariff fury is easing after Tianjin, there may be space for a reset. But the episode has left its mark; India is more willing than before to be seen with Moscow and Beijing, and Washington has learned that economic coercion can backfire in Asia’s most important swing state.","Relations between india and the u.s. have deteriorated under president donald trump.

Rural India's total fertility rate dips to replacement rate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rural-indias-total-fertility-rate-dips-to-replacement-rate/articleshow/123706269.cms,"AI Image used for representative purpose

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","Total fertility rate (tfr) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year.

Bihar had highest tfr among bigger states/uts at 2.8, followed by up (2.6), mp ( 2.4) and and rajasthan (3.3) delhi records the lowest tfr at 1.2. followed by tn and bengal at 1-3 each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123706441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139963,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) hopes to finally deliver the first two `improved’ Tejas Mark-1A fighters to the IAF next month after a long delay, but it will be contingent on the single-engine indigenous jet completing its weapon firing trials.The firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs, which will also demonstrate proper integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system of the Tejas Mark-1A fighter, are scheduled later this month. “Software modifications have been made after a previous test failed,” a source at the defence PSU said.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons behind the excruciatingly slow pace of production of the Tejas Mark-1A jets.“GE has delivered two engines so far. It has promised to deliver 10 more engines by March next year, and then 20 every year thereafter,” the source said.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. The force has so far got only 38 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.It is yet to get the first Tejas Mark-1A jet of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021. All the 83 jets, incidentally, were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the acquisition of another 97 of the jets for Rs 66,500 crore on Aug 19, as was then reported by TOI.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh has publicly criticised HAL for the delays, noting that IAF was “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.The IAF will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 fighter squadrons after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service on Sept 26. This when the force is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.","Hal hopes to finally deliver the first two tejas mark-1a fighters to the iaf next month.

The ""Axis of Upheaval""

A 'Multipolar' world?

Trump’s provocative response

A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media. The image, showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing and exchanging pleasantries, has been hailed as a symbol of a rapidly shifting global order, one that some are now calling a ""new world order"" dominated by Asia.Captured in Tianjin, the photograph depicts three of the most powerful figures in the world today standing shoulder to shoulder, sending a clear message about the growing unity among countries that have faced increasing tensions with the United States.The image, taken during the summit's final moments, has sparked significant commentary from US political analysts, with some expressing alarm over the growing influence of a multi-polar world and the decline of American dominance.US political commentator Van Jones, speaking on CNN, did not mince words when analyzing the significance of the image. “That image of Xi Jinping with Putin, with Modi, with the leader of Iran, and the leader of North Korea, should send a chill down the spine of every American,” he said. Jones warned that the photograph marked a pivotal moment in global relations, suggesting that the traditional US-centric order was under threat.“We’re going to look back on today historically as a very big deal,” Jones continued, adding that the formation of this grouping signified that ""the West is now in a box."" He argued that the US is now ""on the bad end of the triangle"" as global powers realign themselves, particularly those who have found themselves on the receiving end of US tariffs and foreign policy pressures.Jones's reaction echoes a broader anxiety within the US media regarding the rise of non-Western powers, and the perceived collapse of traditional alliances that have long underpinned US influence. In the wake of the photograph's circulation, many commentators in Washington warned that this increasingly multipolar world could leave America increasingly isolated.The timing of the summit, and the leaders’ visible camaraderie, has fueled concerns among US analysts about the formation of a bloc of countries that could challenge American dominance.The Washington Post was quick to label the gathering as the first formal meeting of an ""anti-American axis of upheaval,"" with the leaders of Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia at the helm. This grouping, the paper argued, represents a new coalition of powers that is actively resisting US influence in global affairs.The New York Times also took note of the significance of the photograph, suggesting that the bond between Xi and Putin, both of whom have long been at odds with Washington, was now central to a broader challenge to the US-led world order.The article highlighted that PM Modi’s presence underscored India’s growing diplomatic pivot toward these countries, even in the face of unresolved border disputes with China.As US media dissected the photograph, many commentators, including Jones, drew attention to what they saw as the emergence of a new “multipolar” world.The idea of a multipolar world suggests a global order with multiple power centers, challenging the traditional dominance of the United States and its allies. At the SCO summit, President Xi emphasized the need for countries to reject Cold War thinking, warning against rival power blocs and bullying.Xi's call for a more just and balanced global governance system struck a chord with those critical of US hegemony. The Chinese president's message resonated with many at the summit, who viewed it as a direct rebuke to the West's attempts to impose its values on other regions. “We need to reject the law of the jungle, where the strong prey on the weak,” Xi stated, signaling a firm stance against what he and others see as Western coercion.For many in the US, these remarks reinforced the notion that Washington’s influence was waning. The growing cooperation between China, Russia, and India, despite their differences, has been interpreted as a direct response to what they view as America's increasingly unilateral approach to global affairs.The US reaction to the SCO summit was not limited to political analysts and commentators. US President Donald Trump, never shy about expressing his views on global affairs, took to his social media platform Truth Social to comment on the summit's outcome. Trump’s post, which sarcastically wished President Xi and his counterparts a “great and lasting day of celebration,” reflected his deep concern about the growing solidarity between these leaders.""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,"" Trump wrote, reflecting his view that the gathering represented a collective challenge to US interests.","A single photograph from the recently concluded shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across us media.

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission.

His daughters were born in Pakistan and later shifted with the family to Thalassery.The sisters applied for Indian citizenship, producing an NoC from Pakistan high commission instead of a renunciation certificate. They said under Pakistan's citizenship law, renunciation papers can only be issued after turning 21, and by then they had already surrendered their Pakistani passports.The single bench accepted this plea.The division bench disagreed, ruling that both minors and adults must formally renounce foreign citizenship to qualify.

Jaishankar Urges Stronger India-EU Ties As Trump’s Tariffs Shake Global Strategic Landscape

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said predictability has a huge premium in global politics, a remark made as India looks to readjust its relations with China while manoeuvring through US tariffs.The foreign minister also said the world is witnessing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. ""Changes we see in the world today do influence our policy and do influence the manner we approach other countries,"" he said.Speaking at a press briefing with German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Jaishankar further said: ""We are seeing sweeping changes in the global strategic landscape. We are also seeing volatility on the global economic landscape, and together they make a very powerful case for India and the European Union (EU) and Germany to work more closely with each other.""Jaishankar's remark could also be implied as a jibe at US President Donald Trump, who recently described India's economy as ""dead"" and has upended the global economy with his numerous contradictory tariff diktats.Wadephul said the only demand the Western nations have with regard to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is that ""weapons fall silent"". He said that Russia has ""not been willing"" to sit down at the negotiating table despite ""enormous efforts"" by Trump.""We have right from the outset been pursuing a policy that has the objective of Russia and Ukraine following the path of negotiations. However, what we have noticed of late is that despite the enormous efforts that the American president has invested, Russia has not been willing to sit down at the negotiating table, whereas the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed his immediate readiness to negotiate and sit down at the negotiation table,"" the German foreign minister said.He further said that Ukraine has been attacked ""without having done anything"" to trigger the Russian attack, while choosing to skip Moscow's apprehension of Kyiv joining the US-led Nato alliance, which is argued as a key reason Russian President Putin decided to invade Ukraine.""In a way, it has taken a first step. We're talking about a country that has been attacked without having done anything to trigger that attack. The only demand is that weapons fall silent. No more than that... The German approach and the European approach are that we want to do whatever we can to make President Putin sit down at the negotiating table,"" Wadephul said.On Friday, Jaishankar said India should not be ""unfairly targeted"" in the context of the Ukraine war, as New Delhi continues to face pressure over its oil trade with Russia.""Had a telecon today with Finnish Foreign Minister,"" Jaishankar posted on X. ""Our discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and its ramifications. India should not be unfairly targeted in that context. We have always advocated dialogue and diplomacy.""The remarks come as India is facing 50 per cent tariffs from the United States for purchasing Russian oil. The US administration has accused New Delhi of ""funding the war"" by continuing trade with Moscow.India has strongly criticised Washington’s decision, calling the tariffs ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The Trump administration recently raised duties on Indian goods to over 50 per cent as a penalty for India’s oil imports from Russia.Last week in Moscow, Jaishankar defended India’s position during a joint press briefing with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.

Poll Should there be stricter security measures at airports to prevent such incidents? Yes, definitely No, it's unnecessary

A strange event involving an old man urinating close to an airplane on the runway at Bihar's Darbhanga Airport has gone viral. The concerning incident occurred when a man in traditional white kurta-pajama attire was spotted squatting dangerously close to an aircraft on an active runway. The event was captured on video by the pilot from the cockpit, showing the individual positioned in a grassy area just meters away from the aircraft.The individual's positioning in the grassy area adjacent to the runway suggests a breach of multiple layers of airport security measures. Such areas are typically restricted and monitored to prevent unauthorized access due to the critical nature of aircraft operations. Airport authorities maintain multiple security layers, including perimeter fencing, surveillance systems, and security patrols, to prevent such unauthorized access. This incident may prompt a review of these security measures. However, the 9-second video has been viewed more than 285,000 times, with social media users responding in a combination of laughter and worry.These are some wacky reactions:One of the users said, ""Accha hai na itna samanya darje k log b plane me travel kar rahe hain.""Which roughly translates to,""Its good that even common people are traveling by plane.""Another user said, ""Accurate way to urinate.""In the backdrop, other passengers are lined up to board the aircraft while a voice that is perceived to be the pilot laughs.Another said, “Mera desh badal raha hai aage badh raha hai😂😂. Biharis never fail to surprise us.”Some went on to school the man and the pilot.A user commented, “Airport terminals have sufficient toilets, but still these idiots would do it in the open. Disgusting civic sense of some Indians, they would never learn.”“Pilots making fun of old person. Old people have problems controlling the bladder. Shameful”, said another.The proximity of the individual to active aircraft operations created a hazardous situation that could have impacted flight safety. Aircraft movements require clear and unobstructed runway areas to ensure safe takeoffs and landings.The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is yet to release an official response to the incident. It is as yet unknown whether the man was a passenger or a staffer, or from which airline's cockpit the clip was shot.","Incident occurred at bihar's darbhanga airport.

Marco Rubio Makes Big Charge Against Venezuela As Trump Orders War On Drug Cartels

‘It won’t stop with just this strike’

Maduro deploys troops in response





Defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday issued a stern warning after a US military strike destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang.“It's a new day. It's a different day, and… this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere,” Hegseth said on Fox & Friends.He described the operation as a direct hit against a “narco-terrorist organization” seeking to “poison” the United States with illicit drugs.“We knew exactly who was in that boat. We know exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented,” he said.Hegseth stressed that the action was carried out with “precision” and said more operations will follow. “It won't stop with just this strike. Anyone else trafficking in those waters, who we know is a designated narco-terrorist, will face the same fate, and it's important for the American people to protect our homeland and protect our hemisphere,” he said.Venezuelan minister of communication and information Freddy Nanez dismissed video of the fiery explosion as AI-generated, but Hegseth rejected the claim.“I can tell you that was definitely not artificial intelligence. I watched it live,” he said, as qupted by Fox News.US President Donald Trump confirmed the attack early Wednesday, releasing footage of the explosion and calling it a warning to cartels.“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.He added, “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America.”Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro responded to the strike by deploying troops along the coast and border with Colombia, while urging citizens to join a civilian militia.Maduro has long argued that the US exaggerates Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to push for regime change. He and other officials have pointed to a United Nations report suggesting only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine moves through Venezuelan territory.","Us defense secretary pete hegseth issued a stern warning after a us military strike destroyed a venezuelan drug boat in the caribbean, killing 11 suspected members of the tren de aragua gang. “it won't stop with just this strike.

Maxwell’s controversial move

A personal connection?





James O’Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas and a prominent figure in conservative media, dropped a bombshell on Thursday with the release of a video clip that’s raising eyebrows across the political spectrum.The video features an off-the-record conversation with Joseph Schnitt, an acting deputy chief in the US Department of Justice, in which he discusses the transfer of Ghislaine Maxwell - woman at the heart of Epstein’s dark web - to a minimum-security prison and raises allegations of possible “special treatment” to keep her quiet.The conversation took place in an undercover setting, with a woman questioning Schnitt about his thoughts on the infamous Epstein files and Maxwell’s highly controversial transfer, Mediaite reported.Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in connection with financier Jeffrey Epstein, has remained a lightning rod for conspiracy theories and political backlash.The video begins with a question about the Epstein files, which have long been shrouded in secrecy. The woman in the clip asks, ""But those files do exist?"" to which Schnitt confirms, saying that ""thousands and thousands"" of pages are involved, with a significant number of them expected to be redacted.But it’s what Schnitt says next that sent shockwaves through both the political and media landscapes.He claims, ""I think they visited that Maxwell person. Kind of also involved… Transferred to a minimum-security prison too recently, which is against BOP policy because she’s a convicted sex offender. They’re offering her something to keep her quiet.""The bombshell comment sent O’Keefe into action, sharing the tape with his audience and explaining that Schnitt’s remarks reveal troubling inconsistencies and raise questions about Maxwell’s treatment by the Department of Justice (DOJ). O'Keefe then doubled down, discussing Schnitt's position as an acting deputy chief within the DOJ and the potential implications of his statements regarding the handling of the Epstein files, reported Mediaite.""That was the acting deputy chief of the Office of Enforcement Operations, Joseph Schnitt, telling a stranger about the FBI and DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files,"" O’Keefe remarked. ""It’s a rare glimpse into how some high-ranking officials might view the situation—and it raises significant concerns about transparency and accountability.""In a statement provided to Project Veritas, the DOJ swiftly responded to the video, asserting that Schnitt had no involvement in the department’s internal review of the Epstein materials. ""Joseph Schnitt has confirmed as much to leadership,"" the statement read, adding that his comments were based solely on ""what he learned in the media"" and were ""not reflective of the DOJ’s review process.""The DOJ continued, clarifying that the remarks Schnitt made about Maxwell’s treatment and the handling of the Epstein files were ""baseless"" and ""had absolutely zero bearing on reality."" They also noted that the department remains committed to transparency and is fully complying with requests for documents from the House Oversight Committee.Despite the DOJ's denial, O’Keefe and his supporters argue that the video sheds light on a potential cover-up, with O’Keefe further alleging that Maxwell’s move from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security facility in Texas could be part of a larger effort to suppress crucial information.Maxwell’s recent transfer has already been a source of considerable controversy. She was moved to a federal prison camp in Texas, which is known for offering more lenient conditions compared to high-security facilities.Critics have pointed to the fact that the transfer came shortly after a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney. This connection has only fueled conspiracy theories, particularly among those who believe that the Trump administration may have been trying to distance itself from the fallout of the Epstein scandal.Following the move, Democrats were quick to accuse the DOJ of witness tampering. In a letter to the department, House Democrats raised alarms, writing, “These actions raise substantial concerns that the Administration may now be attempting to tamper with a crucial witness, conceal President Trump’s relationship with convicted sex offenders, and coax Maxwell into providing false or misleading testimony in order to protect the President. ”Adding another layer of intrigue, the DOJ issued an email purportedly from Schnitt, claiming that he met the woman in the video on a dating app and that he was unaware of Maxwell’s transfer. The email further stated that Schnitt’s remarks about the Epstein files were entirely based on public reports and that he had no personal knowledge of the situation.This new development has led to even more questions, with some critics alleging that the DOJ's response might be an attempt to downplay the significance of Schnitt’s comments.","James o'keefe, the founder of project veritas, released a video clip on thursday.
