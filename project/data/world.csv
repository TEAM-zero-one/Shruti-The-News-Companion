"Politico USAID: 'Politico' says it never received govt subsidy as Donald Trump, Elon Musk double down on USAID",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/politico-says-it-never-received-govt-subsidy-as-donald-trump-elon-musk-double-down-on-usaid/articleshow/117988281.cms,"Donald Trump, Elon Musk slam Politico for receiving USAID funds which Politico refused.

President Donald Trump, DOGE chief Elon Musk Thursday doubled down on Politico claiming that it received millions of dollars from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which the new administration wants to shut down as Politico issued a statement claiming that Politico has never been a beneficiary of government programs or subsidies.CNN reported that Politico’s leaders, Goli Sheikholeslami and John Harris in a memo to staff Wednesday, denied that the media company has received any funding from the government. “POLITICO has never been a beneficiary of government programs or subsidies — not one cent, ever, in 18 years,” the news outlet’s leaders wrote in the memo.Politico acknowledged government agencies subscribe to its pro service just like corporations do. “The value of this journalism is clear, as evidenced by our subscription re-enlistment rates,” Politico’s leaders said. The news outlet said it welcomes conversations with government subscribers “and are confident that most will see the continued value.”After conservation commentators Wednesday pounced on Politico claiming that it received funds from USAID, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government would cancel $8 million worth of Politico subscriptions.Donald Trump Thursday morning raged against Politico and made a long post naming Politico. ""Looks like billions of dollars have been stolen at USAID, and other agencies, much of it going to the fake news media as a 'payoff' for creating good stories about the Democrats. The Left Wing Rag known as 'Politico', seems to have received $8,000,000. Did the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? This could be the biggest scandal of them all, perhaps the biggest in history! The Democrats can't hide from this one. Too big, too dirty!"" Trump posted in all caps.News agency Associated Press also issued a statement as the same allegations were raised against it. In a statement, the AP said that the federal government has “long been an AP customer — through both Democratic and Republican administrations.”“It licenses AP’s nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world,” the AP said. “It’s quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.”","Donald trump, elon musk slam politico for receiving usaid funds which politico refused.

PARIS: France on Thursday warned of possible retaliation against Russia for stripping press accreditation from a French reporter, after Paris branded some Russian journalists seeking to work on its territory as spies.On Wednesday, Le Monde , France's newspaper of record, denounced the ""disguised expulsion"" of its Moscow correspondent Benjamin Quenelle , saying his press card had been ""cancelled"" by the Russian authorities.On Thursday, the French foreign ministry urged Russian authorities to reconsider their ""unjustified and arbitrary"" decision, ""which will otherwise call for a response"".Russia said Quenelle's press credentials were not renewed in retaliation for France's refusal to issue press visas to journalists from pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda.Paris has previously accused the journalists of being ""agents of the Russian intelligence services"".""The Russian argument that this is a reciprocal measure is inadmissible,"" the French foreign ministry said.""France has repeatedly made it clear to the Russian side that it is fully prepared to consider applications from genuine Russian journalists in France. It is always ready to do so,"" the ministry added in a statement.Le Monde's editorial director Jerome Fenoglio said in a column published in both French and Russian that Moscow's decision was ""without precedent"".""Even in the tensest moments of the Cold War, Le Monde pursued its work in Moscow and beyond,"" he said.Since launching its invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago Moscow has cracked down on media, throwing domestic reporters and several Western journalists in jail and severely restricting coverage of what it calls its ""special military operation"".In March, 2023 Moscow detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich before sentencing him to 16 years in jail on espionage charges that Washington denounced as trumped-up.The Wall Street Journal and ex-AFP reporter was freed in August 2024 as part of the biggest East-West prisoner swap since the fall of the Iron Curtain.","Le monde denounces the ""disguised expulsion"" of its moscow correspondent benjamin quenelle.

Panama's president denies making a deal that US ships can transit the canal for free,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/panamas-president-denies-making-a-deal-that-us-ships-can-transit-the-canal-for-free/articleshow/117987807.cms,"Cargo ships at the Cristobal port in Colon, Panama (Image credits: AP)

PANAMA CITY: Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday denied the US state department's claim that his country had reached a deal allowing US warships to transit the Panama Canal for free.Mulino said he had told US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth on Wednesday that he could neither set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them and that he was surprised by the US state department's statement suggesting otherwise late Wednesday.""I completely reject that statement yesterday,"" Mulino said during his weekly press conference, adding that he had asked Panama's ambassador in Washington to dispute the state department's statement.On Wednesday evening, the US state department said via X that ""US government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year."" The department had no immediate comment Thursday on Mulino's remarks.The Panama Canal authority put out its own terse statement later Wednesday night saying it had ""not made any adjustments"" to the fees.Mulino said the US statement ""really surprises me because they're making an important, institutional statement from the entity that governs United States foreign policy under the president of the United States based on a falsity. And that's intolerable.""The differing versions came just days after US secretary of state Marco Rubio met with Mulino and canal administrators and visited the critical trade route.Rubio had carried a message from US President Donald Trump that China's influence at the canal was unacceptable.Rubio had told Mulino that Trump believed that China's presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the United States to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal.Canal administrators said they were open to discussing giving US warships priority in crossing the canal, but did not say they had considered waiving fees.Mulino said Thursday that both Panama's constitution and laws regulating the Canal authority make clear that neither the government nor the authority can waive fees. ""It's a constitutional limitation,"" he said.","Mulino says he told us secretary of defense he could neither set fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them.

Trump urges Americans to 'bring God back into our lives' in national prayer breakfast speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-urges-americans-to-bring-god-back-into-our-lives-in-national-prayer-breakfast-speech/articleshow/117987365.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks during the national prayer breakfast, at the Capitol (Image credits: AP)

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Thursday that his relationship with religion had ""changed"" after a pair of failed assassination attempts last year, as he advocated at the national prayer breakfast at the Capitol for Americans to ""bring God back into our lives.""Trump joined a more than 70-year-old Washington tradition that brings together a bipartisan group of lawmakers for fellowship. He will also speak at a separate prayer breakfast at a Washington hotel sponsored by a private group.""I really believe you can't be happy without religion, without that belief,"" Trump said. ""Let's bring religion back. Let's bring God back into our lives.""Trump reflected on having a bullet coming within a hair's breadth of killing him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, telling lawmakers and attendees, ""It changed something in me, I feel.""""I feel even stronger,"" he continued. ""I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it. Something happened.""He drew laughs when he expressed gratitude that the episode ""didn't affect my hair.""The president, who's a nondenominational Christian, called religious liberty ""part of the bedrock of American life"" and called for protecting it with ""absolute devotion.""Trump and his administration have already clashed with religious leaders, including him disagreeing with the reverend Mariann Budde's sermon the day after his inauguration, when she called for mercy for members of the LGBTQ+ community and migrants who are in the country illegally.Catholic vice president JD Vance has sparred with top US leaders of his own church over immigration issues. And many clergy members across the country are worried about the removal of churches from the sensitive-areas list, allowing federal officials to conduct immigration actions at places of worship.The republican president made waves at the final prayer breakfast during his first term. That year the gathering came the day after the Senate acquitted him in his first impeachment trial.Trump in his remarks then threw not-so-subtle barbs at democratic then-house speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who publicly said she prayed for Trump, and senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who had cited his faith in his decision to vote to convict Trump.""I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,"" Trump said then in his winding speech, in which he also held up two newspapers with banner headlines about his acquittal. ""Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so.""Dwight D Eisenhower was the first president to attend the prayer breakfast, in February 1953, and every president since has spoken at the gathering.Democratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and republican senator Roger Marshall of Kansas are the honorary co-chairs of this year's prayer breakfast.In 2023, the national prayer breakfast split into two dueling events, the one on Capitol Hill largely attended by lawmakers and government officials and a larger private event for thousands at a hotel ballroom. The split occurred when lawmakers sought to distance themselves from the private religious group that for decades had overseen the bigger event, due to questions about its organization and how it was funded.In 2023 and 2024, President Joe Biden , a democrat, spoke at the Capitol Hill event, and his remarks were livestreamed to the other gathering.","President donald trump spoke at the national prayer breakfast at the capitol.

These records concern recruits across Hamas' intelligence, military and interior ministry divisions who were later deemed ""unsuitable"".The allegations include religious transgressions and behavioural misconduct, with one document noting ""He constantly curses God"" and ""sexually harassed a young child"". Another states ""He has romantic relationships on Facebook. He never prays. He is behaviourally and morally deviant"".In Gaza, where homosexuality is illegal, such accusations can lead to imprisonment or execution. Former Hamas commander Mahmoud Ishtiwi's case exemplifies this - he was executed in 2016 following accusations of homosexual activity. The documents detail his confession and the severe treatment he endured.Religious authorities wrote in the documents: ""Committing the crime of sodomy in a hideous manner while he is married to two women... This is more heinous than adultery and it has been described as an obscenity in the Qur'an more than once. Sodomy receives its punishment at the very least, which is stoning to death"".Ishtiwi's execution involved three chest shots after approximately a year of imprisonment and torture, including prolonged suspension by his limbs in Gaza prisons, according to the documents.Recent discussions with The Post in Israel revealed that during the October 7, 2023 attacks, Hamas fighters reportedly committed sexual assaults against male Israeli victims, including those held captive afterwards. A source close to the Israeli Knesset noted these incidents weren't widely publicised in Hamas' propaganda due to religious taboos.One Israel Fund's education director Eve Harow told The Post that this internal violence demonstrates Hamas' extreme brutality. She noted that anyone within their society who doesn't conform to their extremist ideology faces severe consequences, including execution.","Hamas executed 94 recruits between 2012 and 2019 for various ""morality"" violations.

A video of RFK Jr adding a blue liquid through a dropper to his water has gone viral with people commenting it was Methylene Blue which could mitigate radiation exposure, could prevent colds etc. Social media users questioned whether Kennedy Jr who will become the Donald Trump administration's health secretary, after Senate confirmation, is doing well health-wise and also whether he put an excessive amount of that blue liquid in his water.MMA fighter Vance Elrod addressed the online curiosity and said Methylene Blue protects against oxidative stress, cold and also boosts autophagy if fasting on flight. ""Also that dose I don’t recommend, but he’s spearheading a movement so I get it,"" Elrod said indicating his disapproval for the high dose that Kennedy Jr took.""Its methylene blue, known to be strong cancer cure and powerful prevention.

DC Plane Crash Latest News: Blackhawk helicopter was flying too high but it had complex conditions: New revelations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/blackhawk-helicopter-was-flying-too-high-but-it-had-complex-flying-conditions-new-revelations/articleshow/117954087.cms,"An Army helicopter crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people in DC last week.

Older-model Blackhawk lacked certain safety technologies



The Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport was flying about 100 feet higher than what was authorized but it was also dealing with a set of complex flying conditions, reports based on the new revelations of the investigation into the DC plane crash said. The Blackhawk crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people leaving no survivor.The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision. But what prompted the helicopter to change its altitude is not yet known.According to experts, 200 feet is a low altitude for the bust airspace, in proximity to other aircraft. The lighting conditions around the Potomac River are tough and there's not many place in the world where all these conditions are present all at once.The Army crew was flying an older-model aircraft that lacked certain safety technologies in its cockpit. The Blackhawk left its home base, Fort Belvoir in Virginia, after dark last Wednesday to conduct a training mission to allow co-pilot Captain Rebecca Lobach to perform a required annual evaluation flight.It was a moonless night at a busy airspace which might have compounded the complex situation that the helicopter found it self in, experts told the New York Times.""Captain Lobach was most likely in the right-hand seat, said a senior Army official who has flown the National Airport helicopter routes repeatedly but requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly,"" the NYT report said.""This is significant, the official said, because if the instructor pilot was busy or distracted with something, Captain Lobach’s seat on the right side of the aircraft might have put her in poor position to view the descending American Airlines flight on her left.""""Still, other experienced military pilots said they were puzzled at the crash, given that military pilots are trained to be ready for such hazards,"" the report said.",The national transportation safety board said in an update tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision.

What we know about Rebecca Lobach



Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld. While her family COMPLETELY scrubbed her social media accounts.

"Trump dinner, 'El-Mo' meeting on cards at PM Modi's US visit on February 13",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-dinner-el-mo-meeting-on-cards-at-pm-modis-us-visit-on-february-13/articleshow/117957325.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington

: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Washington a week from now to meet a US President consumed with grand geo-political ideas and theater, with little bandwidth for the small stuff and minor details. While mollifying Trump on trade issues by reducing tariffs and buying more US products will be part of the Indian approach, Trump's tectonic shake-out proposals in the middle-east suggest he's ready for bold, even outrageous, geo-political gambles, something that sits uneasily with an Indian establishment that is very cautious and circumspect in this regard.Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House after he assumed office for a second term on January 20, a stark reminder of the MAGA-infused President alliance and partnership priorities. Although not a formal treaty ally -- not that he values any alliance -- India is a key piece in Trump's scheme of things. Officials previewing the visit say big ticket announcements on military purchases, energy (including nuclear) supplies, and artificial intelligence collaboration are on the cards in keeping with the new expectations.Visiting Indian PMs typically place great emphasis on engaging the US Congress during such visits, but American lawmakers have been reduced to supine bystanders in the imperial Trump II regime. Instead, the most important interlocutor in Washington DC after the US President is his unelected tech surrogate Elon Musk, who also happens to be a long-time Modi supporter. Sources said an ""El-Mo"" meeting has not been pencilled in yet during the one-day (February 13) visit, but it is very much on the cards given their long engagement going back to 2015, when Modi first visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.The schedule for Modi's visit is still being worked out but sources said he is expected to arrive in Washington DC late on February 12 and depart early on February 14, with all of February 13 committed to bilateral meetings at the White House, with a possible dinner to be hosted by the US President. Musk, who is literally camping out at the Old Executive Office Building next door, will almost certainly be present at the meetings or call on Modi at the Willard Hotel on the other side of the White House.Trump will have most of his cabinet nominees confirmed by the time Modi arrives, along with Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel, both with strong ties to the Modi dispensation that is expected to spur cooperation in intelligence field. The only missing piece will be a new US ambassador to India, which Trump has been unable to fill given that many fat cat donors and MAGA principals are said to have given New Delhi a pass because of pollution issues.Scuttlebutt in the US capital that Trump daughter Ivanka was interested in the job has no basis, sources said, given that she has three young children. Trump has named Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner as the US ambassador to France and another in-law, Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, as Middle East advisor.","Modi will be only the second foreign leader after israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu to meet trump at the white house.

Donald Trump's land grab goes from Greenland to Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-land-grab-goes-from-greenland-to-gaza/articleshow/117954846.cms,"WASHINGTON: In an idea that is audacious and incredible to some and outrageous and abominable to others, America's realtor-turned-President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed the US seizing control of Gaza , scattering its 2 million devastated people elsewhere in the region, and developing the territory into a dazzling ""Riviera of the Middle East.""In an astonishing proposition that drew the proverbial clattering of jaws, bursting of blood vessels, and gasps of disbelief, Trump casually dropped the bombshell at a joint White House presser with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, treating what Palestinians regard as a hallowed homeland as a piece of real estate that is too wasted and dangerous to be re-occupied by them, but which could be rebuilt for others.“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They’ve lived like hell,"" Trump said, referring to Israel's devastating razing of Gaza to avenge the Oct 7 terrorist attacks on Israel that has rendered the territory uninhabitable. ""Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative,” he added in a proposal tantamount to a US-led ethnic cleansing.Incredulity coursed through the journalists' throng as Trump proposed wiping out Palestine from history. “You are talking tonight about the U.S. taking over a sovereign territory. What authority would allow you to do that? Are you talking about a permanent occupation?” NBC's Kelly O’Donnell asked.“I do see a long-term ownership position,” Trump responded, adding, ""Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area..."" Trump said, without explaining why it could not be rebuilt for Gazans, and by Gazans.Trump's stunning realty-centric proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including by ally Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.Even Trump's own allies in the US, including some MAGA principals, were taken aback, saying he should be focused on ""America first"" rather than get distracted by a middle-east project.Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump ally, called the proposal “problematic,” while another Republican Senator Thom Tillis said there were “a few kinks in that slinky.""Democrat lawmakers were less inhibited and called the idea ""nuts"" and ""deranged."" Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told reporters, “You can report that I was speechless,” before adding, ""That’s insane. I can’t think of a place on Earth that would welcome American troops less and where any positive outcome is less likely.”Trump's stunning proposal was prefaced -- and perhaps encouraged -- by remarks from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who praised the MAGA supremo's ""willingness to puncture conventional thinking... willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas... cut to the chase, see things others refuse to see, say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop people scratch their heads and say, 'You know, he’s right.'""Coming after other geo-politically stunning ideas like buying or absorbing Greenland and Canada into the US and retaking the Panama Canal, Trump's Gaza gambit was not dismissed outright although some commentators did argue that it may have been aimed at diverting attention from the turbulent developments in Washington DC where the President's major domo Elon Musk is hacking down the traditional establishment.Some Trump aides suggested that the US President was merely grandstanding and his remarks were aimed at galvanizing other Arab states to come up with solutions rather than leave Palestinians in the lurch. ""It's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions,"" Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said in one TV interview.While Trump appears to have loosened Chinese tentacles enveloping the Panama Canal and bullied Canada and Mexico into making modest concessions that his supporters are portraying as big wins, his grab for Greenland and Canada remains sketchy. Many MAGA activists are in fact unhappy that he is expending so much energy on geo-political projects after having pledged that the US would not get into foreign conflicts.","Donald trump proposes the us seizing control of gaza and developing the territory into a dazzling ""riviera of the middle east"" the proposal was immediately rejected by arab countries, including by ally saudi arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a palestinian state is firm and unwavering.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117954920,imgsize-31152,width-400,resizemode-4/117954920.jpg"
