NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday called out the West for not backing New Delhi's stance on terror, and reiterated that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was negotiated between the DGMOs of the two countries.At a press conference in Washington DC, Jaishankar said there are often countries that do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism.""It is a fact that often countries do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism, which they would do when they themselves are. In that respect honestly, we have been much more consistent and principled. When terror attacks happen elsewhere outside India, we have largely followed the same position that we have taken when they have happened in India,"" said the EAM.He further said that countries are not backing each other ""sufficiently enough"" and part of diplomacy is to ""exhort them, encourage them, persuade them, motivate them to do that, and which is why it's important to speak up, and which is why it's important to carry them with us to the best possibility"".Asked about the recent ceasefire between India & Pakistan after the Operation Sindoor and role of the US in mediation, the EAM said: ""The record of what happened at that time was very clear and the ceasefire was something which was negotiated between the DGMOs of the two countries...""he said, refuting US President Donald Trump's repeated claim that he brokered the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.Jaishankar, who is in the US for 3-day trip for the Quad foreign ministers meeting, had also met Indian-origin FBI Director Kash Patel ,US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.They held a discuss on various topics ranging from cooperation between India and the US in countering organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism to the global situation and bilateral cooperation.",Eam s jaishankar said there are often countries that do not take a position when some other countries are victims of terrorism.

Isro is deeply appreciative of the partnership and camaraderie shown by our counterparts around the world.”Reiterating that the mission was conceptualised during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the US in 2023, Isro said the PM’s leadership continues to shape India’s future in space as one that is collaborative, confident, and committed to peaceful exploration.Ax-4 is expected to provide useful operational inputs for Isro’s Gaganyaan programme , particularly in areas such as astronaut health telemetry, crew-ground coordination, multi-agency integration, and experiment execution in space conditions.“These insights will directly influence mission planning, safety validation, and astronaut readiness for India’s first indigenous human spaceflight mission,” Isro said.Onboard the ISS, a set of Indian scientific experiments is being conducted as part of the Ax-04 mission. These cover life sciences, fluid dynamics, health monitoring, and Earth observation.“Redwire Space, US, is coordinating the payload integration activities. Redwire facilitated key steps, including technical validation and compliance with ISS payload requirements. Each experiment is packaged into flight-ready payload containers. Redwire is also supporting the development of hardware handling protocols, ensuring that the Indian experiments could be safely deployed and operated onboard ISS, thereby enabling meaningful scientific outcomes for India’s research community,” Isro said.Pointing out how the launch was rescheduled multiple times due to issues such as a harness problem in Dragon, weather in the ascent corridor, leakage in the Falcon-9 booster stage, and leakage in the Zvezda Module of the ISS, the space agency said: “The Isro delegation played a constructive role in resolving all the issues. It made its stand clear that all problems should be resolved before clearing the launch for lift-off, considering the mission risks and safety of the crew. ”The Indian astronauts —Shukla and his backup Group Captain Prashanth B Nair — have trained in spacecraft systems, microgravity operations, emergency protocols, space medicine, and experiment handling. As part of the programme, he also participated in Nasa’s National Outdoor Leadership Programme (NOLPS) in the Mexican wilderness, designed to build team resilience and psychological readiness.","Axiom-4 follows in the legacy of international cooperation that sent rakesh sharma to space in 1984 aboard the soviet soyuz.

"Early days, but Dalai Lama succession potential friction point in Sino-Indian ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/early-days-but-dalai-lama-succession-potential-friction-point-in-sino-indian-ties/articleshow/122212662.cms,"Dalai Lama (AP photo)

The 14th Dalai Lama’s announcement of a succession plan, ruling out any Chinese role in the matter, set off a firestorm with the Chinese ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, saying in a detailed response that the reincarnation must comply with “religious rituals and historical conventions as well as Chinese laws and regulations”.While it’s still early days, the contentious issue of finding a successor for the revered spiritual leader upon his death can also potentially lead to another flashpoint in India’s relationship with China that has shown several signs of improvement in the past 9 months.Beijing is likely to choose its own successor to the Dalai Lama and will closely follow how India, home to the Tibetan government-in-exile, reacts to the likely dual succession. The Beijing-based China Tibetology Research Center, which is responsible for shaping China’s Tibet policy, warned in 2019 that bilateral ties would be adversely impacted if India chose to disregard the appointment of Dalai Lama through the “traditional” process. Unlike the US though, India has not spoken officially on the succession issue and it’s unlikely it will be in any hurry to do so now.The Center told a visiting Indian media delegation, which included this reporter, that no wise leader or friendly country would do that but also remarked that India can stay away or not publicly endorse the Chinese pick.For China, the Dalai Lama succession is an internal process that has been followed since 1792, when the Qing dynasty apparently introduced it.The Dalai Lama, however, has said in the past that his successor could come from his followers in India and that a Communist China, which rejects religion, should have no role in such religious affairs.Apart from identifying the next Dalai Lama in China, Beijing lists drawing of lots from a golden urn and recognition of the central government as essential elements of finding a successor, saying the current Dalai Lama was himself chosen through the same process.For India, the Dalai Lama remains a spiritual figure - deeply respected even by the Indian people - who has not been allowed to conduct political activities on Indian soil. Beijing, however, has often attributed motives to his spiritual and religious actions and the fact that he has been allowed to visit Arunachal Pradesh that is claimed by China. It was perhaps not a coincidence that the 73-day India-China Doklam military standoff at Doklam in 2017 took place barely a couple of months after the Dalai Lama’s visit to the Indian state.In 2011, the Dalai Lama transferred his political authority to the Tibetan government-in-exile that’s based in India. India has been silent on the succession issue, which will likely be a long-drawn process, unlike the US which maintains that reincarnation is a religious issue with no role for any State in it. While Beijing sees the reincarnation as a matter of Chinese sovereignty, the US believes it’s about religious freedom and human rights and threated to raise the US at the UN in 2019.In his announcement, the Dalai Lama said that only his Trust and ""no one else” has any role to play on the succession issue. Xu said in his response that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni and other grand Living Buddhas must go through the Golden Urn lottery procedure, and selected candidates would be subject to approval by the central government of China.“The practice of Living Buddha reincarnation has continued over 700 years, and has formed rigorous religious rituals and historical conventions,” he said.","The 14th dalai lama’s announcement of a succession plan, ruling out any chinese role in the matter, set off a firestorm.

Buddhists from across world wrote to Dalai over continuation of institution

KULLU: Ahead of his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama on Wednesday said the institution of the Dalai Lama would continue, and that Gaden Phodrang Trust, founded by him, has the sole authority to recognise the future reincarnation.In a message to China, which has been insisting that it would choose the successor, the 14th Dalai Lama said ""no one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter"".""When the time comes, His Holiness will reincarnate, and any adult or a person from any gender can be recognised as his reincarnation,"" said Samdhong Rinpoche, a member of the Trust, at a press conference in McLeodganj. ""It's not necessary that the next Dalai Lama will be from Tibet,"" Rinpoche said.A PTI report from Beijing quoted the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman rejecting this succession plan. At a media briefing, Mao Ning insisted any future heir to the Dalai Lama ""must follow the principles of domestic (Chinese) recognition - the 'Golden Urn' process - and approval by the central govt (Beijing) in line with Chinese religious traditions and laws"".In a recorded video statement shown on Wednesday, the first day of the three-day 15th Tibetan Religious Conference that started in McLeodganj, the 14th Dalai Lama said responsibility for choosing his successor rests exclusively with the members of the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit foundation established by him in 2015.Gaden Phodrang members should carry out the search for his successor in accordance with tradition, he said.""They (the members) should consult the various heads of Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. The members should carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition,"" said the Dalai Lama.The Dalai Lama recalled that he had asked, during a meeting with the heads of Tibetan spiritual traditions on Sept 24, 2011, whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue, and mentioned then that as far back as 1969 he had made it clear that the ""people concerned should decide whether the Dalai Lama's reincarnations should continue in the future"".""I also said during the meeting in 2011 that when I am about 90, I will consult the high lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, to re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue,"" he said.The Dalai Lama also said that he has had no public discussions on this issue in the last 14 years. However, members of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, members of the Central Tibetan Administration, NGOs, Buddhists from the Himalayan region, Mongolia, Buddhist republics of the Russian Federation, and Buddhists in Asia, including from mainland China, have written to him with reasons, earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue.""In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,"" said the Dalai Lama.Trust member Rinpoche said there wouldn't be any other message from the Dalai Lama regarding his successor in the coming days. ""Whatever instructions he will give now will be meant for the Gaden Phodrang Trust only.""It's not necessary that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation would be from Tibet only, he remarked. ""There are no restrictions or limitations of geographical boundaries when it comes to the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. In the past, the Dalai Lamas have taken birth in different countries,"" he said.In response to a question on the future of the Tibetan freedom movement, Penpa Tsering, head of the Tibetan govt-in-exile, said Tibetans would continue to follow the ""middle way policy"". ""It was proposed by the Dalai Lama and approved by a majority of Tibetans in 1996, and unanimously adopted by the Tibetan govt-in-exile. This policy cannot be changed by one person and will continue in future as well. There will have to be a referendum to change our policy,"" said Tsering.","Buddhists from across world wrote to dalai over continuation of institution.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in Mali, a country grappling with a fresh wave of terrorist attacks.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said the Indian workers, employed at the Diamond Cement Factory in Kayes, were taken hostage during a coordinated armed assault on the factory premises on July 1.A day after the incident, India formally called upon the Mali government to take “all necessary measures” to ensure their “safe and expeditious” release.“The incident occurred on July 1, when a group of armed assailants carried out a coordinated attack at the factory premises and forcibly took three Indian nationals as hostages,” the MEA said.While no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction so far, Al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for multiple coordinated attacks across Mali on the same day.The Indian embassy in Bamako, according to the MEA, is in “close and constant” touch with local authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the management of Diamond Cement Factory. It is also in contact with the families of those kidnapped.“The government of India unequivocally condemns this deplorable act of violence and calls upon the government of the Republic of Mali to take all necessary measures to secure the safe and expeditious release of the abducted Indian nationals,” the MEA said in a statement.It added, “Senior officials of the ministry are closely monitoring the evolving situation and remain engaged at various levels to facilitate safe and early release of Indian nationals.”The government has also advised all Indian citizens currently residing in Mali to “exercise utmost caution, remain vigilant and stay in close contact with the embassy in Bamako for regular updates and necessary assistance.”The MEA reiterated that it “remains committed to ensuring the safe return of the abducted Indian nationals at the earliest” and will provide “all possible support” to them and their families.",India voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in mali.

It also urged all UN States to cooperate with “all relevant authorities” in this regard, without naming Pakistan or India.In his opening remarks at the meeting in Washington, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had said India expected Quad – a strategic grouping of leading maritime nations committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific – to understand and appreciate India’s right to defend its citizens from cross-border terrorism. This was the first Quad ministerial since the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the subsequent India-Pakistan conflict that ended with India’s bombing of Pakistan air bases.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen, while injuring several others,” said the Quad statement, expressing deepest condolences to the families of the victims.The UN Security Council (UNSC) statement condemning the attack in April seemed to have acted as a template for the Quad, the former having urged UN States to cooperate with all relevant authorities – without specifically mentioning India - in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. Like with the UNSC condemnation, there was also no mention of the perpetrator group – The Resistance Front (TRF) – in the Quad statement. As a non-permanent Council member, Pakistan had worked to water down the UNSC statement with support from Beijing.“We call for the perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay and urge all UN Member States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSCRs, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard,” added the Quad statement.Like in the past, the Quad ministerial unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, renewing commitment to counterterrorism cooperation.Apart from India, Quad comprises the US, Australia and Japan, all of which had separately condemned the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India, however, was keen that Quad do so in a joint statement for a more impactful response to Pakistan’s role in the attack and its support for cross-border terrorism.It was a fair expectation, given Quad’s strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the past too, like after the foreign ministers’ meeting in Tokyo last year in July. On that occasion, Quad had strongly condemned 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks, calling for bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice without delay, and naming UN-proscribed groups including Pakistan-based JeM and LeT for concerted action against them by the international community. There was no mention this time of any Pakistan terror group or the Mumbai and Pathankot attacks in the Quad statement.","The quad foreign ministers strongly condemned the pahalgam terrorist attack in a joint statement.

'Destination you'll never want to leave': Jet lag or just Kerala vibes? UK F-35B’s extended vacation goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/destination-youll-never-want-to-leave-jet-lag-or-just-kerala-vibes-uk-f-35bs-extended-vacation-goes-viral/articleshow/122205214.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kerala’s tourism department has turned a grounded fighter jet into a flying PR moment, poking fun at the British Royal Navy after one of its most advanced aircraft, a £90 million F-35B Lightning II, found itself stuck at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport for over two weeks following an emergency landing.Jumping at the chance, Kerala Tourism shared a cheeky post featuring the marooned jet alongside the line: “Kerala, the destination you’ll never want to leave.” The image even included a five-star review from the jet itself: “Kerala is such an amazing place, I don’t want to leave. Definitely recommend.”The F-35B jet had been operating from the UK’s aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales when it was forced to divert to the Indian airport on 14 June due to low fuel. Though it landed safely, it subsequently developed a hydraulic failure on the ground, complicating its return to service.A UK engineering team is now en route to Thiruvananthapuram with specialised tools to carry out the necessary repairs. The aircraft will be moved to the airport’s Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility to minimise disruption to scheduled air traffic. If the repair proves too complex on site, defence officials have indicated that the jet could be transported back to the UK in a military cargo aircraft.The British High Commission has expressed gratitude for India’s cooperation, noting that the Indian Air Force, Navy and local airport authorities provided immediate assistance, including refuelling, recovery clearance, and security support.The F-35B, which is capable of short take-off and vertical landings, is considered a crucial asset for carrier-based operations.

Strengthening pilot training and safety protocols Rebuilding passenger trust and confidence

NEW DELHI: Yet another Air India wide body aircraft had a close shave within 38 hours of the deadly June 12 AI 171 crash in Ahmedabad. Immediately after taking off from Delhi in the early hours of June 14, a Vienna-bound Boeing 777 got stall warning. It also got ground proximity warning system’s (GPWS) don’t sink caution, asking pilots not to lose altitude as the aircraft operating as AI 187 had witnessed altitude loss of about 900 feet during climb.Luckily, pilots recovered the aircraft from this precarious situation and safely proceeded to the destination. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing the incident; have already summoned AI’s head of safety for this case and both the pilots have been taken off flying duty pending the investigation.According to flight tracking sites, the B777 (VT-ALJ) took off at 2.56 am on June 14 in bad weather. Delhi was witnessing a thunderstorm that time. “The aircraft was involved in an inflight occurrence of stick shaker and GPWS caution. Soon after takeoff, stick shaker warning and GPWS don’t sink caution appeared. Stall warning came once and GPWS caution came twice. There was an altitude loss of around 900 feet during climb.Subsequently, the crew recovered the aircraft and continued the flight to Vienna,” said officials aware of the incident.Stick shaker refers to the control column on the flight deck shaking and making a noise to indicate something is not right and that the pilots’ attention to the situation is urgently required. In this case the pilots did that and saved the day. The flight landed safely in Vienna after 9 hours and 8 minutes. After this technical halt in Europe necessitated by longer routes taken these days due to enroute airspace closures, the aircraft then proceeded to Toronto with another set of crew members.However, the flight report for Delhi-Vienna sector only had the “stick shaker due turbulence after takeoff mentioned and not the other occurrences in detail,” said officials. When authorities examined the B777’s flight data recorder (DFDR), possibly as part of the enhanced surveillance ordered by the DGCA after AI 171 crash, the other occurrences of GPWS don’t sink caution and stall warning appearing came to light, they say.An AI spokesperson said: “Upon receipt of the pilot's report, the matter was disclosed to DGCA in accordance with regulations. Subsequently, upon receipt of data from the aircraft's recorders, further investigation was initiated. The pilots have been off-rostered pending the outcome of the investigation.”Both the pilots have been off rostered (taken off flying duty) pending investigation. The regulator has taken a very stern view on the June 14 incident. It is learnt AI head of safety was summoned on this issue.Following AI 171 crash, the DGCA had on June 17 raised “concern regarding recent maintenance-related issues” reported by Air India and directed the airline to strictly focus on safety while “strengthen(ing) internal coordination across engineering, operations, ground handling units.”Multiple industry insiders said: “Old Air India (PSU time) did not have comfortable planes running on time but safety was never an issue. Now planes, at least the narrow body fleet, are better but passengers are apprehensive about safety after the terrible AI 171 crash. The new management and the new owner need to win back passenger and employee trust at the earliest by doing all it takes.""","Air india wide body aircraft had a close shave within 38 hours of the deadly june 12 ai 171 crash in ahmedabad.
