NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday paid tributes to the soldiers, that were killed in the Pulwama attack 7 years ago calling them ""brave heroes"".""Remembering the brave heroes who laid down their lives in Pulwama on this day in 2019. Their devotion, resolve and service to the nation remain forever etched in our collective consciousness. Every Indian draws strength from their enduring courage,"" said PM Modi on X.Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi also remembered the soldiers saying, ""My heartfelt tribute to our brave soldiers who were killed in the audacious terrorist attack in Pulwama in 2019. The nation shall forever remain indebted to them for their supreme sacrifice in the defence of Mother India.""Vice President CP Radhakrishnan also paid his tributes on the seventh anniversary of the attack. ""I pay homage to the brave personnel who laid down their lives in the Pulwama terror attack . Their supreme sacrifice will forever remain etched in the nation's memory and continues to inspire us to build a strong and secure India,"" he said.On February 14, 2019, the Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the deadliest terror attacks in Indian history.A convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) travelling along the Srinagar–Jammu National Highway was targeted in a suicide bombing, killing 40 personnel. The date has since been remembered as a “Black Day” in the country’s security narrative.The convoy consisted of 78 buses carrying nearly 2,500 CRPF personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into one of the buses, causing massive casualties and destruction.The attack drew widespread international condemnation and led to an immediate tightening of security protocols across Jammu and Kashmir. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility, stating that a suicide bomber carried out the assault, according to local media reports.In response, India initiated a series of counter-terror measures, most notably conducting airstrikes on alleged terror training camps across the border in Pakistan. The military action marked a sharp escalation in tensions between the two countries.Beyond its immediate impact, the Pulwama attack reignited global debate over cross-border terrorism, militancy in Jammu and Kashmir, and the broader security dynamics between India and Pakistan.","Pm modi on saturday paid tributes to the soldiers killed in the pulwama attack 7 years ago.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the international fleet review (ifr) and exercise milan from feb 15 to 25.

'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





Bangladesh will vote Thursday in a Parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for India than any such exercise in the recent past in its neighbourhood. Ironically, with Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League not in the fray, India’s best hopes of a realistic reset in ties with Dhaka rest on a majority for the frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s bête noire and a party with historically fraught ties with New Delhi.Wrongfooted by the 2024 July Uprising that ousted long-term ally Hasina, India intensified its outreach to the BNP realising the then Khaleda Zia-led party offered the optimum choice for future legitimacy and stability in the country. The renewed engagement with BNP leaders, PM Narendra Modi’s offer of help for Zia’s treatment just before her demise and his letter to her son and current leader Tarique Rahman, delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar, firmed up the initiative, despite the restraining factor of Hasina’s presence in India.In the absence of the banned Awami League, the election is expected to see a tight bipolar contest between the BNP alliance and the other major bloc comprising 11 parties – including a curious mix of Islamists and Gen-Z revolutionaries - which is led by India’s traditional foe Jamaat-e-Islami.Jamaat is joined by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political outfit composed of student leaders who led mass protests that toppled Hasina.Apart from the election outcome, India will also closely follow the Constitutional “July Charter” referendum that will take place alongside the general election. With its emphasis on a two-term limit for the PM, introduction of an upper house to review legislation and on Bangladeshi, not Bengali, identity, the referendum seems designed not just to prevent the return of “authoritarianism” but also to minimise India’s deep-rooted cultural and linguistic bonds with the country.While India would not like to delay any outreach to the likely new government, given the significance it attaches to ties with Dhaka for its own security and also Bangladesh’s growing reputation as a “swing state” coveted by powers like the US and China, any such exercise will be mindful of several key concerns.First of course is security. Not allowing Indian insurgent groups in the northeast to use Bangladesh territory against India will top India’s agenda with the new government, given that the BNP-Jamaat government two decades ago was accused of providing safe havens to such groups. Robust security cooperation, including intelligence-sharing, can mitigate concerns.Equally important will be preventing Pakistani forces from using Bangladesh to target Indian interests. The interim government has already effected a dramatic turnaround in ties with Pakistan and efforts to step up defence and security ties with frequent visits to Dhaka by ISI officials will aggravate India’s security concerns. Pakistan pivot is also what the BNP-Jamaat government was accused of in the past. India will also watch closely Chinese ingress into Bangladesh’s defence sector, including a recent deal to manufacture drones not far from Indian territory.The safety and security of the 13-million strong Hindu community will also be on top of India’s agenda with the new government, as evident from the way Modi has himself raised this issue on several occasions. India will expect continued cooperation for transport of goods to the northeast through ports in Bangladesh under the existing frameworks.However, for any outreach to be meaningful, India might have to first address the Hasina factor. The BNP will press on with the demand to extradite Hasina, who has been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity. According to a source in Dhaka, this is an issue that relates to the people’s sentiments and India will not be seen as a reliable ally till the time it is seen as shielding Hasina.While a likely BNP government is expected to aggressively pursue issues related to border killings, water sharing and even revival of SAARC, India might also face a challenge in the form of a resurgent Jamaat that is projected to win anywhere between 50 to 100 seats, more than ever in its history. If that happens, the party could trigger some serious anxiety in India about its role not just as a powerful opposition but also a potential ally of the BNP.","Bangladesh will vote thursday in a parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for india than any such exercise in the recent past.

Why stock market crashed today: Top 5 reasons

IT sector stocks crash

Weak global equity markets

Dollar strength, weak rupee

Weak technical set-up

Geopolitical tensions linger

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market crash today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the equity benchmarks, crashed in trade on Friday amid weak global cues and the continued IT stocks selloff. While Nifty50 went below 25,500, BSE Sensex closed down over 1,000 points. Nifty50 ended the day at 25,471.10, down 336 points or 1.30%. BSE Sensex closed at 82,626.76, down 1,048 points or 1.25%.The stock market slide was led by continued selloff in IT shares which weighed heavily on market sentiment amid rising concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. Large-cap technology stocks such as Infosys, TCS, HCLTech and Wipro led the losses.Selling pressure in IT stocks intensified for a second straight session after the American depositary receipts of Infosys and Wipro dropped nearly 10 percent overnight. During Friday’s trading, the Nifty IT index fell more than 4 percent, taking its two-day decline close to 10 percent. Major sector players including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, HCLTech and Mphasis declined between 4 and 6 percent, indicating widespread weakness across the segment.Negative sentiment strengthened after US-based artificial intelligence startup Anthropic introduced a new enterprise-oriented tool designed for corporate legal teams.The company, known for its Claude chatbot, said that the platform can automate several tasks such as contract reviews, non-disclosure agreement sorting, compliance processes, preparation of legal briefs and standardised responses. This development has raised concerns about the long-term demand outlook for traditional IT services.“Tech stocks, reeling under the Anthropic shock, are unlikely to recover soon,” warned V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments Limited. He added that Indian IT may continue to face pressure in the near term, while a rotation of capital toward stronger-performing sectors could support stocks outside the technology space.Global market sentiment remained fragile after sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday, driven largely by heavy selling in technology stocks. Investors turned cautious amid growing concerns that artificial intelligence could disrupt earnings visibility and compress margins across the sector.The Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, fell around 2 percent, while broader US indices also declined as market participants evaluated fresh labour market data and positioned themselves ahead of the closely monitored January inflation figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 669.42 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 49,451.98. The S&P 500 slipped 108.71 points, or 1.57 percent, to 6,832.76, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 469.32 points, or 2.03 percent, ending at 22,597.15.Asian equities mirrored the weakness on Friday, pulling back from recent record levels as concerns over profitability pressures in the technology sector weighed on major stocks such as AppleA stronger US dollar, which extended gains for a third consecutive session to 96.93, along with a softer rupee, added to market pressure.The Nifty closed in negative territory on Thursday, slipping out of its recent consolidation range and forming a short-term pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The 26,000 level continues to act as a significant resistance zone, supported by strong call writing activity and multiple failed attempts to move higher.Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East has continued to weigh on investor sentiment after Donald Trump warned that the United States could consider action against Iran if negotiations over a nuclear agreement fail, even as diplomatic efforts remain underway. Adding to market unease, Trump indicated that deploying an additional aircraft carrier to the region is under consideration as Washington and Tehran prepare to restart discussions.","Nifty50 and bse sensex crashed in trade on friday amid weak global cues and the continued it stocks selloff.

Bangladesh election results: What BNP’s win means for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-election-results-what-bnps-win-means-for-india/articleshow/128302525.cms,"Tarique Rahman’s BNP Heads For Landslide In Bangladesh Election, Rivals Cry Foul

What the BNP's win means for India

BNP’s past history with India

What Tarique Rahman has said on India

Hindu minority

Infiltration and border security

Water-sharing and the Teesta issue

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide victory in the country’s first parliamentary elections since the deadly 2024 uprising that forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina from office.The BNP is led by 60-year-old Tarique Rahman, its prime ministerial candidate, who returned to Bangladesh in December after spending 17 years in self-exile in London. He is the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who passed away in December.The contest was largely a two-way race between the BNP and an 11-party alliance led by the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, a conservative religious party whose growing political influence has raised concerns, particularly among women and minority communities.In immediate recognition of the political shift in Dhaka, New Delhi signaled its readiness to engage with the incoming government.Extending his wishes on X (formerly Twitter), Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated, “I convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals. ”The Prime Minister also spoke to Rahman and extended country's continued commitment to the peace, progress and prosperity of the people of both countries.""Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.The BNP, in turn, thanked India and Prime Minister Modi for recognising the verdict of Bangladesh’s general elections and expressed hope that bilateral relations would strengthen under the new government.One of the most pressing geopolitical challenges before the new administration will be recalibrating ties with India. Under Sheikh Hasina, New Delhi was Dhaka’s closest strategic partner. However, relations deteriorated sharply following her ouster, with tensions becoming more visible in recent months.The BNP’s earlier terms in office (1991–96 and 2001–06) were marked by periodic friction with New Delhi.Diplomatic ties reached particularly low points during the 2001–06 period, when the BNP governed in coalition with the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami. Indian officials accused the BNP-led government of failing to curb anti-India insurgent groups operating from Bangladeshi territory. Concerns peaked in 2004 when a large cache of arms, allegedly meant for the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), was seized in Chittagong.In contrast, India invested heavily in its partnership with Sheikh Hasina over the past 15 years, viewing her government as a dependable partner on security cooperation and regional stability.Despite the historical baggage, Tarique Rahman has recently adopted a pragmatic tone. The BNP’s 2026 election manifesto introduced the doctrine of “Bangladesh Before All,” under the slogan: “Friends, yes; Masters, no.”In an interview with The Guardian, Rahman acknowledged that relations with India deteriorated after Hasina’s removal but emphasised his desire for “a relationship of mutual respect and mutual understanding.”When asked whether full normalisation was possible while India continues to provide refuge to Sheikh Hasina—whose extradition the BNP has formally sought—Rahman responded cautiously, saying, “That depends. It has to be on them too.”The safety of minorities, particularly the Hindu community, remains a sensitive and closely watched issue in bilateral ties. In the months following Hasina’s ouster in August last year, several incidents of violence targeting minorities were reported.India responded with a strongly worded statement. “The unremitting hostilities against minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, Christians and Buddhists, at the hands of extremists are a matter of grave concern,” New Delhi said.“Over 2,900 incidents of violence against minorities, including cases of killings, arson and land grabbing, have been documented by independent sources during the tenure of the interim government. These incidents cannot be brushed aside as mere media exaggerations or dismissed as political violence,” the MEA spokesperson added.Securing the long and porous India-Bangladesh border remains one of the most sensitive issues between the two countries. Illegal cross-border migration continues to be politically charged in border states such as West Bengal and Assam.The BNP’s manifesto promises to take a “strict position” to end alleged “border killings” by India’s Border Security Force (BSF) and to halt what it describes as “push-ins” of individuals from the Indian side without due legal process.Bangladesh shares 54 rivers with India, making river diplomacy central to bilateral engagement. The BNP manifesto places significant emphasis on securing what it calls a “fair share” of water from transboundary rivers such as the Teesta and the Padma.The party has signalled that it may pursue the China-backed Teesta River Master Plan—an initiative that New Delhi has opposed due to concerns over Chinese involvement near the strategically sensitive Siliguri Corridor.Additionally, the 1996 Ganges Water Treaty is due for renewal this year.Ultimately, the BNP’s decisive return to power represents a significant geopolitical shift in South Asia. For New Delhi, the phase of relying predominantly on one political leadership in Dhaka has ended, replaced by the need to engage a more assertive and politically distinct administration.",The bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) has secured a landslide victory in the country’s first parliamentary elections since the deadly 2024 uprising. The contest was largely a two-way race between the bnp and an 11-party alliance led by the islamist jamaat-e-islami.

FTAs show increased global confidence in India: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ftas-show-increased-global-confidence-in-india-pm-modi/articleshow/128327925.cms,"With 'World In Turmoil', India-EU FTA Emerges As PM Modi’s Double Engine Bet For Shared Prosperity

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday rejected the criticism over the recent free trade agreements, asserting that few countries were willing to sign FTAs during the UPA dispensation when India was marred by scams and counted among ‘Fragile Five’ economies, while it is now capable of competing with the world.Addressing the ET NOW Global Business Summit, the PM said UPA could conclude FTAs with only four countries, while his govt has signed agreements covering 38 countries.“Who would have confidence in India when policy paralysis and scams marked its governance,” he said in a swipe at the UPA govt. To emphasise what has changed since 2014, he added that new policies and capabilities effected by his govt have led to a transformation.The celebration of FTAs signed seemed to mark a rejection of the criticism by Congress and other opponents as well as the confidence that the charges against the trade deal with the US were not going to wash. “India today is full of self-confidence. It is ready to compete with the world and has built a strong manufacturing ecosystem,” he said.Modi said the post-second World War global order is now crumbling and a new order will emerge, and India is going to be a big basis of global transformation in this century of change.While the pandemic, conflicts and supply chain breakdowns marked this decade, it has also shown India’s resilience in this period of crisis, PM Modi said. “I am proud that unprecedented development, great delivery and strengthening of democracy have marked this decade in India amid numerous disruptions,” he said.The PM said a decade ago, there were apprehensions that India might slip from its position of 11th-largest economy, but growing rapidly, it is now on its way to become the third biggest.“It currently accounts for 16% of global growth and its share will only increase. It will drive the world’s growth and be its engine,” Modi said, adding he was not speaking as an astrologer.Budgets, he said, reflect the changes ushered in by his govt. Earlier, Budget talk would revolve around outlays, allocations and what products became expensive and cheaper, but now focus is on outlay as well as outcome. “Before 2024, off-Budget borrowing was prevalent. Now off-Budget reforms are prevalent.”Citing reforms in a host of sectors, including GST changes, education and nuclear energy, labour laws, repeal of Article 370 and waqf laws, Modi stressed reforms are now pushed round the year and technology and innovation have become the core drivers of growth.Underlining wholesale reforms under his govt in policy, process, delivery and mindset as well, he said it would take years for building a road in border areas as permissions needed to be taken from Delhi, but the NDA dispensation has empowered local authorities to take measures as they deem fit for development.India is riding the ‘Reform Express’ and will continue to gain speed, he said. “While earlier reforms, be it in 1991 when the economy was on the brink or during the UPA-era when NIA was formed after the 26/11 terror attack, were undertaken under compulsion, these are now powered by conviction.”UPA carried out reforms in the power sector only after grid failures and Food Security Act was introduced when inflation soared and hunger spread in tribal areas, yet even then it was poorly implemented, he said, emphasising that reforms born out of compulsion never yielded proper results for the nation.He located his govt’s push for reforms in the context of the new world order, which is taking shape after the weakening of post-World War II array, where each country would need to be resilient. “Digital India, e-payment system, and Jan Dhan-Aadhaarmobile trinity were not born out of compulsion, but conviction, driven by the vision of including citizens who were earlier left out,” he said.“India today is full of selfconfidence. It is ready to compete with the world and has built a strong manufacturing ecosystem,” he said.Lauding Modi’s leadership, The Times Group MD Vineet Jain said India has transitioned from a land of aspirations to a nation of achievements. “In an era marked by unprecedented geopolitical turbulence, India has showcased its diplomatic acumen by concluding five transformative trade agreements within a single year... The PM has positioned India as a bridge-builder in a fractured world,” he said.The Times Group MD referred to increasing competition and monopolisation of tech businesses by global giants and said India should target building globally competitive businesses in tech and media sectors. “As social media and AI become primary consumption channels, India must establish a regulatory framework ensuring fair compensation for its media industry,” he added.","Prime minister narendra modi said few countries were willing to sign ftas during the upa dispensation when india was marred by scams. “india today is full of self-confidence. It is ready to compete with the world and has built a strong manufacturing ecosystem,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128327983,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-57778,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday congratulated Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chief Tarique Rahman on his party’s ""decisive victory"" in the country’s parliamentary elections, and affirmed India’s continued support for a ""democratic, progressive and inclusive"" Bangladesh.“I convey my warm congratulations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” PM Modi said in a post on X.“I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals,” he added.The BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the general elections, winning more than 200 seats — one of its strongest performances, surpassing its 2001 tally of 193 seats. The outcome is widely seen as paving the way for political stability after months of unrest that followed the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in August 2024.Rahman, son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is expected to be sworn in as prime minister. He returned to Dhaka in December after spending 18 years abroad. His father ruled Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981 and remains a prominent figure in the country’s independence-era politics.Soon after the results became clear, the BNP thanked voters and urged restraint among supporters.“Despite winning ... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement, instead calling for nationwide prayers.The election marked the first since Hasina fled to neighbouring India. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, 85, had been serving as interim head of government following her departure. Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, had dominated Bangladesh politics for years alongside Khaleda Zia, Rahman’s mother and a former prime minister.The Awami League, which governed for 15 years but was barred from contesting this election, had earlier recorded a larger mandate of 230 seats in 2008.Meanwhile, the head of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami conceded defeat, stating that his party would not engage in the “politics of opposition” merely for its own sake. The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who were instrumental in the movement against Hasina and part of a Jamaat-backed alliance, managed to win only five of the 30 seats it contested.","Bnp secured a commanding two-thirds majority in the general elections.

'Symbols Of British Empire': PM Modi On North & South Block In 1st Address From Seva Teerth

Here are the top quotes from PM Modi:

Future generations should remember this era as a time when India re-wrote its fate.

I want Seva Teerth to be a role model for citizen-centric governance.

Decisions taken in these new buildings will decide the course of our journey to emerge as a developed nation by 2047.

Dreams of citizens our biggest assets; their aspirations should guide us.

I want Seva Teerth to be a role model for citizen-centric governance.

You all will play key role as India has boarded 'Reform Express', is re-writing international ties with new trade deals.

Unfortunate that road along PM's residence was called Race Course Road and that leading to President's House was Rajpath.

I can say with pride that Seva Teerth, Kartavya Bhawans built to fulfil aspirations of Indians, not of any monarch.

These 100-year-old buildings were becoming dilapidated, lacked space, facilities; they were inadequate to meet needs of a new nation.

India's capital moved from Kolkata to buildings on Raisina Hill that were built according to the wishes of British royalty.

South Block and North Block were built with an aim to keep India under colonial shackles for centuries.

We are entering Seva Teerth and Kartavya Bhawan 1 and 2 with a resolve to achieve the goal of Viksit Bharat.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated two new Kartavya Bhawans and released a commemorative postage stamp and coin on Friday, hours after shifting to his new office, ""Seva Teertha. ""The Prime Minister said the newly inaugurated buildings reflect India’s commitment to citizen-centric governance and national progress.""Today we all are witnessing a new history being made... This day of 13th February is witnessing a new beginning in India's development journey... Today, we are all entering Seva Teerth and Kartavya Bhavan with the resolve to achieve 'Viksit Bharat'. We have the divine blessings of achieving our goals,"" he said.PM Modi noted that after independence, many crucial decisions shaping the nation’s future were taken, and key policies were framed within buildings such as the South Block and North Block.He added that it is important to remember these structures were originally built as symbols of the British Empire. ""The intention behind their construction was to reinforce British dominance and keep India in a state of subjugation for generations,"" he said.The Prime Minister said Seva Teerth and Kartavya Bhavan have been constructed to fulfil the aspirations of the people of India.Seva Teerth houses the Prime Minister’s Office, the National Security Council Secretariat and the Cabinet Secretariat, all of which were earlier functioning from separate locations.Kartavya Bhavan-1 and 2 accommodate several key ministries, including the ministry of finance, ministry of defence, ministry of health and family welfare, ministry of corporate affairs, ministry of education, ministry of culture, ministry of law and justice, ministry of information and broadcasting, ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare, ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, and the ministry of Tribal affairs.","Seva teerth houses the prime minister’s office, the national security council secretariat and the cabinet secretariat.

In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones

Israel Bombs Gaza; Kids Among Several Killed As IDF Claims Attack On Soldier In Northern Strip

NEW DELHI: Author Arundhati Roy has announced that she will not attend the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale), where a film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s Classics section. Roy’s screenplay, written 38 years ago, was selected for screening at Berlinale 2026. In a statement released on Friday, she described the selection as meaningful on a personal level.“In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, a whimsical film that I wrote 38 years ago, was selected to be screened under the Classics section at the Berlinale 2026. There was something sweet and wonderful about this for me,” she said.However, Roy said she had been grappling with broader political concerns related to Germany’s stance on Palestine, even as she acknowledged the support she has received from German audiences in the past. “Although I have been profoundly disturbed by the positions taken by the German government and various German cultural institutions on Palestine, I have always received political solidarity when I have spoken to German audiences about my views on the genocide in Gaza.This is what made it possible for me to think of attending the screening of Annie at the Berlinale.”Her decision not to attend, she said, followed remarks made by members of the Berlinale jury earlier on Thursday. “This morning, like millions of people across the world, I heard the unconscionable statements made by members of the jury of the Berlin film festival when they were asked to comment about the genocide in Gaza. To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping. It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time—when artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop it. ”Roy went on to state her position unequivocally: “Let me say this clearly: what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people...""She also criticized prominent cultural figures for what she sees as their silence. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”Concluding her statement, Roy announced her withdrawal from the event: “With deep regret, I must say that I will not be attending the Berlinale.”","Author arundhati roy has announced that she will not attend the berlin international film festival (berlinale) a film she wrote nearly four decades ago is scheduled to be screened in the festival’s classics section.

NEW DELHI: The govt informed Parliament on Thursday that rules, regulations and policies are being drafted for effective implementation of the provisions of the SHANTI Act, 2025, though it declined to provide a timeline for the same.The govt also said that directorates, wings and divisions will be set up to ensure enforcement of safety, security and safeguards, and to improve inter-agency coordination to fix licensees’ accountability during a radiation emergency.“The timelines for the framing of rules, regulations, policies and implementation of provisions of the Act have not been notified by the govt so far,” minister of state in the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh said in a written reply.Passed during the Winter session, the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act paves the way for opening the otherwise highly restricted nuclear energy sector to private players to boost the country’s nuclear capacity.The minister said that the nuclear energy programme is in a decisive expansion phase, backed by policy reforms, private sector participation and clearly defined capacity targets up to 2047.He added that the legal framework of the Act aligns civil nuclear cooperation to enhance nuclear energy’s share in meeting national goals with domestic and international commitments on safety, security, safeguards and civil liability for nuclear damage.Replying to a separate question, the minister said, “safety first, production next” remains the guiding principle of India’s atomic energy sector and allayed concerns over safety at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. He informed the Upper House that timelines and safety measures are being followed in commissioning nuclear plants, and Unit-3 of the Kudankulam plant is likely to be completed by 2026 and Unit-4 by 2027.The country’s nuclear capacity is set to nearly triple to about 22,380 MW by 2031-32 from the current 8,780 MW and further expand to 100 GW by 2047, he said.","The govt informed parliament on thursday that rules, regulations and policies are being drafted for effective implementation of the shanti act, 2025.

In several locations, protests also took place outside the homes of Congress leaders.In Hoshiarpur, Deputy Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Jai Krishan Singh Rouri, along with some party MLAs, were among those present at the protest.The ruling party even arranged for a wedding band to play during the demonstrations as a symbolic protest against Bajwa's alleged derogatory remarks.Addressing the gathering in Hoshiarpur, AAP leaders described Bajwa's comments as ""unfortunate and unacceptable,"" demanding an apology from him. They stated that they would continue to oppose him on this issue during the upcoming Budget session of the Punjab Assembly.Bajwa had accused Minister Harbhajan Singh of corruption and stated that the Congress would hold him accountable once they form the government.""Jehra pehle band vajaanda reha, ehda band asin vajaavange (He who used to be a band player will be taken to task by us), Bajwa had said, referring to Singh.In response, Harbhajan Singh criticised Bajwa, asserting that mocking honest, hard-earned livelihoods was shameful.

""In a democratic system, it is not appropriate to make comments on someone's background or profession. Such language has no place in Punjab,"" he said.Rouri added that Bajwa's remarks had hurt the sentiments of working-class individuals.

‘Modi Under Trump’s Grip’: Rahul Gandhi Hits Back At Nishikant Dubey’s Motion

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Friday continued his attacks on the PM Modi-led Centre over the recently finalised India-US trade deal, calling the Prime Minister “Narendra Surrender Modi” and alleging that he has “betrayed” the country’s farmers, who, he said, “have realised this. ” He also said that the deal is “not a fair fight” for farmers.Escalating his offensive, Rahul Gandhi targeted the Union government, saying, “This isn’t just a trade deal; it’s a direct attack on the livelihoods of our food providers.”Taking to X, Rahul Gandhi posted a video of his meeting with a delegation of farmers’ unions and wrote, “In today’s meeting in Parliament with the delegation from farmers’ unions, their concerns were clearly evident. Farmers, already grappling with inflation, rising costs, and uncertainty over MSP, are now being left unprepared to face foreign crops backed by massive subsidies and mechanised strength.”He added, “This isn’t a fair fight; it’s one-sided pressure. The government’s empty assurances won’t wash anymore. The future of our farmers cannot be bartered away without their consent.”Reiterating his and his party’s stance, Rahul said, “Come what may, the Congress Party and I stand with India’s food providers for their rights, security, and dignity.”Earlier as well, Rahul Gandhi had criticised the Centre over the deal with Washington, alleging that the agreement “betrays our food security and farmers,” and claiming that PM Modi opened India’s agricultural market because US President Donald Trump “has him by the throat.”Responding to the allegations and clarifying the Centre’s position, Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Shivraj Singh Chouhan rejected Rahul Gandhi’s claims, calling them “baseless” and accusing him of having “no concern for Bharat.”Goyal termed Rahul a “habitual liar” and accused him of “misleading farmers with a fake narrative and trying to provoke them.”“He has never cared for our motherland, nor can we expect him to work for a strong and prosperous future for India,” Goyal added.In a separate post on X, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also criticised Rahul, saying, “Rahul Gandhi is a liar and has nothing to do with the interests of farmers. He consistently speaks against the nation’s interests. He has broken all records of lying and wants to mislead the nation. PM Modi has always taken decisions in the best interests of farmers. Farmers are fully protected under the Indo-US trade agreement. ”The war of words comes just days after India and the United States unveiled their new trade framework, the result of months of negotiations that began in February 2025.

DMK spokesperson A Saravanan questioned how many more lives would be lost before the assembly elections and claimed that arrangements such as shelter and drinking water were inadequate at the rally.The TVK, however, denied all these allegations and said the preparations were made in advance for the rally as per requirement. ""We are saddened by this. We heard from the family that today he suffered a cardiac arrest. We provided all first aid and sent our ambulance. But unfortunately, he passed away.

Congress Demands Union Minister Hardeep Puri Resignation Over Alleged Jeffrey Epstein Links Row

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday demanded the resignation of Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri over his alleged links to the Jeffrey Epstein case, intensifying its attack after the minister acknowledged meeting the disgraced financier several times in a professional capacity.Congress leader Pawan Khera said that the party believes Puri has no right to remain in office.Speaking to reporters, Khera said, “Clearly, the Congress party is demanding the resignation of Hardeep Singh Puri. This person has no right to remain in his position. In the last 48 hours, he has only lied. We will raise this issue before the people of the country that this government is compromised, and that too with a person like Jeffrey Epstein.”The demand comes after Puri, at a press conference on Wednesday, said that he had met convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein “three or four times” over eight years in what he described as a “professional capacity”.Responding to allegations raised by leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, Puri said that the interactions were limited and already in the public domain following the release of millions of emails by US authorities.At the press conference, he stated, “There are references to possibly three or four meetings in eight years… Any contact I had with him has no connection to the serious allegations of sexual abuse filed by victims.”He further clarified, “My interaction had nothing to do with that,” stressing that the meetings were linked to his tenure as India’s Ambassador to the United Nations and later engagements with the International Peace Institute.Explaining the context, Puri said his former superior at the International Peace Institute, Terje Rod-Larsen, knew Epstein and that he met him as part of official delegations. He maintained that the interactions were entirely professional and predated his entry into the Union Cabinet in 2017.However, the Congress rejected the minister’s explanation. Earlier, Khera raised a series of questions regarding an alleged 2014 email exchange that forms part of documents released by the US Department of Justice. He questioned why Puri referred to Epstein as a “friend” in an email and why he sought “advice” from him if their association was only incidental.In another post, Khera accused Puri of trivialising Epstein’s crimes, writing that reducing the conviction to “soliciting favours of a woman who was underage” downplayed the gravity of sexual exploitation of a minor.The controversy began after Rahul Gandhi claimed he had “verified information” and alleged that “there are Department of Justice files on Epstein naming Hardeep Puri.” Gandhi also alleged broader pressure on the government in the context of international developments, including the India-US trade deal.Puri dismissed Gandhi’s remarks as “baseless allegations” and described parts of his speech in Parliament as having “elements of buffoonery” and “entertainment value”. He insisted that his name appearing in released documents does not imply wrongdoing and that his meetings were unrelated to the criminal charges against Epstein.The exchange has triggered a sharp political confrontation between the ruling BJP and the Congress, with the opposition demanding accountability and the minister defending his record.As the row escalates, the Congress has said it will continue to raise the matter publicly, while the government has maintained that there is no wrongdoing on the part of the minister.","Congress leader pawan khera said that the party believes puri has no right to remain in office.

PoK And Aksai Chin In India Map: US Trade Deal Post Forced Pakistan To Rush Washington To Rectify

Screenshot of map shared by US Trade Representative Office

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday sharply criticised external affairs minister S Jaishankar, accusing him of failing to safeguard India’s diplomatic interests after deletion of an Indian map by the United States.Congress leader Pawan Khera took to X to question the government’s silence after a spokesperson of Pakistan’s Foreign Office claimed credit for the removal of the Indian map by the United States that had depicted the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), as part of India.Giving context to his criticism, Khera wrote: “A spokesperson of Pakistan’s Foreign Office claimed credit for the deletion of an Indian map by the United States - a map that depicted the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), as part of India. Yet we haven’t heard a word on this from our Ministry of External Affairs.”Targeting Jaishankar directly, he added: “I have asked this before, and I will ask it again: What exactly does the ‘Forum Minister’ do? Is his job limited to delivering speeches at international fora or does it also include doing some substantive work for India’s interests?”In an earlier post, Khera had also criticised the minister’s foreign engagements, stating: “We will again see the ‘Forum Minister’ speak from his pulpit at some new forum in the world.The taxpayer is paying for his lavish trips and he has a big fat zero to show for his efforts.”Further listing his concerns, he wrote: “In a latest interview, Trump again claimed he use trade and tariffs to threaten Modi to stop Operation Sindoor. India has been arm twisted to stop buying Russian Oil. We continue to lose the battle of narratives against Pakistan - the US Trade Representative Office has deleted a map showing the entire Jammu and Kashmir (including PoK) as a part of India. What is Jaishankar doing?

It also depicted Aksai Chin within Indian territory.The release of the map was seen by some analysts as a significant departure from earlier US depictions, which often marked these areas as disputed.

Who is Tarique Rahaman

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday spoke with Tarique Rahman, hours after congratulating him on the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) decisive victory in the Bangladesh’s parliamentary elections and reaffirming India’s commitment to close bilateral ties.In a post on X, PM said, “Delighted to speak with Mr. Tarique Rahman. I congratulated him on the remarkable victory in the Bangladesh elections.” He added, “I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.”“As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India’s continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,” the Prime Minister said.Earlier in a separate post, PM Modi congratulated Rahaman when results were being announced, “I convey my warm congratulations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading BNP to a decisive victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.” He added, “I look forward to working with you to strengthen our multifaceted relations and advance our common development goals.The BNP secured a two-thirds majority in the general elections, winning more than 200 seats – surpassing its 2001 tally of 193 seats. The result is being seen as ushering in political stability after months of unrest following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a youth-led uprising in July 2024.Rahman, son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, returned to Dhaka in December after spending 18 years in exile and is expected to be sworn in as prime minister. Ziaur Rahman ruled Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination in 1981 and remains a key figure in the country’s political history.Soon after the results were declared, the BNP thanked voters and urged restraint. “Despite winning ... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement, calling instead for nationwide prayers.The election was the first since Hasina fled to India. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, 85, had been serving as interim head of government after her departure. The Awami League, which governed for 15 years but was barred from contesting, had won 230 seats in 2008.Meanwhile, the head of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami conceded defeat, saying his party would not engage in the “politics of opposition” for its own sake. The National Citizen Party, led by youth activists involved in the anti-Hasina movement and part of a Jamaat-backed alliance, won five of the 30 seats it contested.","Pm modi speaks to bnp chief tarique rahman, congratulates on 'remarkable' bangladesh poll win.

Nehru probably knew that we had something, as the McMahon Line was in the east, and we had some kind of a claim in the Ladakh area, but it was not here. So that's why he wanted to go in for a Panchsheel agreement, and for the Chinese also. When they had kind of liberated Tibet, they had moved into Lhasa. This particular area was extreme at both ends.""""So they wanted stability, probably in this particular region. Independent India was keen to build a good relationship with China. In 1954, India recognised Tibet as part of China. Both countries signed the Panchsheel Agreement,"" he added.General Chauhan also said that the India must rethink how it views Himalayan boundary, particularly in Uttarakhand’s middle sector.""Himalayas have functioned more as a zone of interaction rather than a border of exclusion. Uttarakhand is a civilisation landscape where the sacred and the strategic have been coexisting for ages,"" CDS said.The right place actually to have a think tank like BHISM because in Dehradun, it is uniquely positioned to develop static thought that is terrain conscious, system oriented, and long horizon in its character,"" he added.","Cds general anil chauhan links history with border disputes with china, recalls nehru knew about it.
