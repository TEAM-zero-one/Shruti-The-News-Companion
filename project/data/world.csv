NEW DELHI: USAID did not provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India between 2014 and 2024, the US embassy has informed the Indian govt, according to a reply by ministry of external affairs in response to a Parliament question. US President Donald Trump had earlier questioned the alleged funding, saying he suspected ""they were trying to get someone else elected"".MoS for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said that on July 2, 2025, the US embassy shared data that, it said, covered USAID funding in India from 2014 to 2024, including details of implementing partners, objectives and key accomplishments of each activity undertaken.""The embassy also maintains that USAID/India did not receive or provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India from fiscal years 2014 to 2024, nor has it implemented any voter turnout-related activities in India,"" said the minister, in response to a written query in Rajya Sabha.""On July 29, 2025, the US embassy conveyed to MEA that it plans to bring all USAID operations to a close by Aug 15, 2025,"" he added. The MEA had earlier requested the embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all USAID-assisted/funded projects in India over the last 10 years (other than those being implemented under the seven partnership agreements with Indian govt).MEA also sought a list of NGOs/implementing partners through which such initiatives were executed.Trump had earlier accused USAID of working to effect a change of govt in India. Reports later suggested that the funding might have been meant for Bangladesh. ""Why do we need to spend $21 million on voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian govt... Because when we hear that Russia spent about $2,000 in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for $2,000. This is a total breakthrough,"" Trump had alleged.","Usaid did not provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in india between 2014 and 2024, the us embassy has informed the indian govt.

After Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh killed three taking a wrong turn with his semi-truck in Florida, the Donald Trump administration dug out all his previous records and it's now confirmed that he was arrested by the Border Patrol two days after he illegally entered the country through California in 2018. Harjinder Singh's immigrant proceedings are pending following his arrest on September 20, 2018, said the Department of Homeland Security.When he was arrested in 2018, he was processed for expedited removal but he claimed at that time that he was scared to return to India. Fox News reported that his fear was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services and he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond.Singh was arrested after three people were killed near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike on August 12. All three of them were in a minivan. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene, and the driver, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, later died in the hospital.Singh was arrested by US Marshals in California on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with a deadly crash in Florida, according to Fox News. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.After the video recorded inside the semi-truck went viral, Indians were attacked for driving mishaps on US roads and after Singh was found to be an illegal alien from India, the incident became a major political flashpoint.DHS said Singh stated that he does not have a serious physical or mental medical condition, has ""no known immediate relatives serving in the US military and is not the primary caretaker of a person with mental or physical disability, a minor or person with a serious illness."" Singh is also unmarried, has no minor dependent children and is not a victim of domestic violence or human trafficking -- factors that could have stopped his immediate deportation.""After careful consideration of all factors and available records, Singh is considered a significant threat to public safety and is an exceptional circumstance warranting enforcement action due to the serious nature of his criminal history,"" DHS said.",Indian-origin truck driver harjinder singh who killed three in florida said in 2018 he was scared to go back to india. 3 people were killed near fort pierce on the florida turnpike on august 12.

Poll How do you view the current situation in Gaza? Critical and needs immediate attention Under control and manageable

What this could mean



Arab countries are not on board

Situation in Gaza remains dire







Israel pushed deeper into the contested territory of Gaza on Wednesday, pressing ahead with a plan to seize the Strip while simultaneously approving thousands of new housing units in the occupied West Bank, moves that sparked international alarm and reignited debate over the future of a Palestinian state.Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, the military’s chief spokesperson, declared that Israel “has begun the next phase of the war,” with troops edging into Gaza City’s outskirts and preparations under way to relocate displaced residents to southern Gaza, reported NYT.Meanwhile in the West Bank, the government greenlit 3,400 settlement homes in a project described by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a hard-line coalition partner, as proof that the “idea of a Palestinian state is being erased from the table.”For the takeover move, Israel's defence minister has authorised the call-up of about 60,000 reservists, piling pressure on Hamas.The dual announcements landed just as mediators floated a new ceasefire proposal -- one reportedly close to terms Israel had previously backed. However, Israel's plan to move ahead with the takeover plan cast doubt on whether talks could advance amid the escalations.The looming assault aims to prevent Hamas, which led the deadly October.7, 2023, onslaught on southern Israel that started the war, from regrouping and planning future attacks, an Israeli military official, who requested anonymity in line with military protocol, told NYT on Wednesday.If Israel takes ""full control"" of Gaza, it would reverse the decision made in 2005 when Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from the area.Since then, Israel has kept control over Gaza’s borders, airspace, and utilities. This move could also mean that the Israeli military would enter parts of Gaza that it does not yet control. Some right-wing leaders in Israel argue that the 2005 pullout from Gaza helped Hamas rise to power by winning elections in 2006.Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal is to defeat Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages, but it’s unclear if this plan is for the short term or something longer.So far, no Arab country has agreed to help govern Gaza after the war. A Jordanian official told Reuters, ""Arab countries would only support what Palestinians agree and decide on."" He added that security should be managed by Palestinian institutions.A Hamas leader, Osama Hamdan, told Al Jazeera that any force trying to govern Gaza alongside Israel would be treated as an ""occupying"" power.Earlier this year, Egypt proposed a plan backed by Arab countries to set up a neutral Palestinian committee to run Gaza after the war. But both Israel and the United States rejected it.The Israeli army has claimed it now controls about 75 per cent of Gaza. But most of Gaza’s 2 million people have been displaced many times over the past 22 months. Aid groups are warning that famine is very close.One resident, 30-year-old Aya Mohammad, said, ""Where should we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough."" Hamas says it will only agree to a deal that ends the war permanently. Israel says Hamas is not serious about giving up power.","Israel pushes deeper into contested territory of gaza on wednesday, pressing ahead with a plan to seize the strip.

NEW DELHI: A day after Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi concluded his two-day visit to India, China’s ambassador to India Xu Feihong voiced strong opposition to the United States’ tariff measures against New Delhi and emphasized the need for closer cooperation between India and China.“US has imposed tariffs of up to 50% on India and even threatened for more. China firmly opposes it. Silence only emboldens the bully. China will firmly stand with India,” Xu said, underscoring Beijing’s willingness to support New Delhi against unilateral trade restrictions.The envoy stressed that the partnership between India and China is crucial for regional and global development. “For two neighbouring countries of such size, unity and cooperation are the only way to achieve common development. China and India’s friendship benefits Asia. We are the double engines of economic growth in Asia. India and China unity benefits the world at large. India and China have the responsibility to take the lead in promoting an equal and orderly multipolar world,” he said.Xu further noted that trust-building is essential in the bilateral relationship. “China and India should enhance strategic mutual trust, and avoid mutual suspicion.Both countries are partners, not rivals. We should manage differences through dialogue,” he said.“We are willing to work with India to enhance development of our strategies and enlarge the cake of cooperation. We welcome all Indian commodities to enter the Chinese market.”Xu highlighted the progress on the boundary issue following Wang Yi’s visit. “This time, during the Chinese FM visit to India, he had a very important talk with Mr Doval on the boundary issue.

The second group will focus on proper management of the border and border areas,” Xu said.He added, “We should not define the border issue as relationship between our two countries.

They also agreed to create a Working Group under the WMCC framework to advance effective border management.Further, Xu noted that the two sides agreed to “create General-Level Mechanisms in the Eastern and Middle Sectors, in addition to the existing General-Level Mechanism in the Western Sector, and hold the next round of General-Level Mechanism meeting in the Western Sector at an early date.”On economic and trade ties, Xu said the two countries agreed to reopen the three traditional border trading markets — Renqinggang-Changgu, Pulan-Gunji, and Jiuba-Namgya — and to hold the 25th round of SR talks in China in 2026.Both sides also discussed cooperation on trans-border rivers.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi voiced regret over Parliament’s repeated disruptions as the Monsoon session ended on Thursday with low productivity. PM Modi reportedly took a veiled swipe at the Congress leadership, accusing it of sidelining its own younger MPs out of ""insecurity.""According to PTI sources, PM Modi made the comments during the customary tea meeting in Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s office, a tradition marking the end of every session. This time, however, opposition leaders stayed away, underlining the deadlock that dominated this session's proceedings.Though PM Modi did not name Rahul Gandhi, his remarks were widely seen as directed at the Congress leader spearheading protests against the Election Commission’s voter list revision in Bihar. The bright and young MPs of the Congress do not get to participate in discussions due to the ""insecurity"" of its leadership, PM Modi reportedly said, according to PTI sources.PM Modi also expressed disappointment that key legislation, including the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, had been cleared without debate amid the uproar. He nevertheless praised the gaming ban law for its ""far-reaching impact,"" noting the social harm caused by real-money online games.He lamented that Parliament missed the chance to discuss several important bills, saying disruptions robbed the House of meaningful debate.With opposition benches empty at the Speaker’s tea, BJP leaders remarked on Congress' absence, suggesting the party had grown difficult to engage with. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said opposition MPs might have been ""too embarrassed"" by their behaviour during the session to attend.Rijiju also alleged that Congress negotiators often reached understandings with the government in pre-session talks but failed to follow through, hinting at ""pressure from the top.""Throughout the session, the INDIA bloc staged noisy protests inside and outside Parliament, accusing the BJP of ""vote theft"" through the Bihar electoral roll revision. The government, however, pressed ahead, passing multiple bills despite the din.Monsoon session, which concluded on Thursday, saw frequent disruptions that overshadowed legislative business, with the House losing over 84 hours to forced adjournments, the highest in the 18th Lok Sabha.The month-long session that started on July 21 had 21 sittings with 37 hours and 7 minutes of effective business, according to the Lok Sabha secretariat.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said that all parties had decided at the beginning of the session that discussions would be held for 120 hours in this session.""The Business Advisory Committee also agreed to this.

NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday informed the Rajya Sabha that the United States embassy has contradicted claims made earlier this year by US President Donald Trump, stating that USAID had not allocated $21 million to boost voter turnout in India.In a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question, Minister of State for External Affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said the US Embassy in New Delhi has formally informed India that ""USAID/India did not receive or provide funding of $21 million for voter turnout in India from fiscal years 2014 to 2024, nor has it implemented any voter turnout-related activities in India.""This clarification came after the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in February 2025, had publicly posted about cancelling $486 million in USAID funding worldwide, including an alleged $21 million earmarked for ""increasing voter turnout in India.""

NEW DELHI The first uncrewed mission of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme is ready to launch with a robot and the liftoff is expected in December, said Isro chairman V Narayanan here on Thursday.“The first uncrewed mission, G1, is going to lift off by this year's end, maybe close to December. And in that, the Vyommitra, the half-humanoid, is going to fly,” Narayanan said.Addressing the media in the presence of space minister Jitendra Singh and astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, the Isro chief lauded Shux for his successful mission to the International Space Station (ISS) — the first ever by an Indian. His experience of piloting the Axiom-4 mission is set to be crucial for the Gaganyaan mission Narayanan said SpaceX had probably taken “lightly” the liquid oxygen leak in the Falcon-9 rocket that launched the Axiom-4 mission to the ISS, putting at risk the lives of the four astronauts, including Shukla. “If with a crack the rocket lifts off, with the vibrations, it will give way the moment it lifts off. Once it gives way, it will be a catastrophic situation, nothing else,"" he said.Shux, who achieved the ISS feat on June 26, called it the “mission of an entire nation”.“I would like to thank every citizen of this country who behaved in a way that made it feel like they actually owned this mission. I truly felt that this was a mission for the entire nation,” he said. Shukla said being on the space station “is very different from what you learn on the ground. It was an unbelievable experience”.“We have been able to achieve all our technical objectives,” he said. ""We had seven different experiments to conduct, ranging from stem cell research to growing sprouts on the space station. Some of them started showing results while we were there. The results were very encouraging”.“Crew Dragon is one of the three vehicles that can currently take humans to space. We were also fortunate to have training on the Soyuz, which launches from Russia, besides Crew Dragon. The ISS, as you know, is an orbiting laboratory that has been operational since 2000.

NEW DELHI: With PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping set to carry forward the Sino-Indian rapprochement in their upcoming meeting in Tianjin, Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong Thursday backed India on the issue of US tariffs saying China strongly opposed the Trump administration's move to impose 50% tariffs on India for its oil procurement from Russia.Xu said in the face of such acts, silence or compromise only emboldens the bully.""US has imposed tariffs of up to 50% on India and even threatened more. China firmly opposes it. China will firmly stand with India to uphold the multilateral trading system with WTO at its core,"" said the ambassador.He also said the essence of trade was to complement each other's advantages and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, not a calculation of who loses and who gains. He said trade should not become a tool for pursuing individual selfish interests.""US has long benefited gr-eatly from free trade, but now it is using tariffs as a bargaining chip to demand exorbitant prices from various countries,"" said Xu at an event organised by thinktanks Chintan Research Foundation and Centre for Global India Insights. ""The development of China and India has not been completely smooth, but fri-endship and cooperation have always been the main theme.There might be challenges, but unity and cooperation are our only options,"" said Xu.His remarks came ahead of Modi's first visit to China in seven years. He will be in Ti-anjin on Aug 31 for SCO summit, on the margins of which he will have bilateral meetings with Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and leaders of other member-states.The ambassador called for enhancing strategic trust and focusing on common interests. He said economic and trade structures of China and India were complementary.""We'll welcome more Indian commodities into the Chinese market. India has a competitive edge in IT, software and biomedicine, while China is seeing rapid expansion in the fields of electronic manufacturing, infrastructure construction and new energy. The Chinese side welcomes more Indian enterprises to invest in China. It is also hoped that the Indian side could provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for the Chinese enterprises in India, so as to promote common development of industries and benefit the people of the two nations,"" he said.","Xu said in the face of such acts, silence or compromise only emboldens the bully.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar Thursday defended India's energy imports from Russia, saying the US (former Biden administration) wanted India to do ""everything to stabilise the world energy markets, including buying oil from Russia"".After meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow, Jaishankar said, ""Incidentally, we also buy oil from America and that amount has been increasing. So, quite honestly, we are very perplexed at the logic of this argument that is referred to"". He was replying to a question on President Trump slapping an additional 25% tariff on India, accusing it of profiteering from Russian oil and bankrolling Russia's war on Ukraine.Jaishankar pointed out that China, not India, is the biggest buyer of oil from Moscow. ""We aren't a country that has (had) the biggest trade surge with Russia after 2022 (start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict),"" he said.Jaishankar also called on President Vladimir Putin. ""Appreciate his sharing perspectives on the global situation and recent developments on Ukraine,"" he said on X, adding preparations for the Modi-Putin summit towards the end of the year are well underway.Jaishankar said he and Lavrov discussed possible outcomes from India-Russia annual summit that will have Putin visiting India towards the end of the year. “We’ve looked at energy, including not just fossil fuel energy but also nuclear energy where we have a very strong history of cooperation with Russia...very good discussions on fertilizer supply,” he said.Jaishankar and Lavrov discussed issues related to Ukraine war, West Asia and reform of global governance, while taking stock of bilateral relations. On terrorism, Jaishankar said he conveyed India’s strong resolve to adopt a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and its sovereign right to defend citizens against cross-border terrorism.He also raised the issue of Indians serving in the Russian Army, expressing hope that the Russian side would expeditiously resolve these matters.“We believe relations between India and Russia have been among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after the Second World War. Geo-political convergence, leadership contacts and popular sentiment remain its key drivers,” he said. “Our defence and military-technical cooperation also remains robust. Russia supports India’s Make in India goals, including through joint production and technology transfer,” Jaishankar said.On global and multilateral cooperation, both sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to reform of global governance. “We underlined the imperative to expand and energise the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary realities.

Poll Are tit-for-tat airspace bans an effective strategy in international relations? Yes, it shows strength. No, it leads to more conflict.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23, prolonging the restrictions for another month amid continuing tensions between the two countries.The Pakistan Airports Authority confirmed the move in a fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), stating, “All aircraft operated by Indian airlines will not be allowed to use Pakistani airspace. The ban also remains in place for military and civilian aircraft that are Indian-owned or leased.”The restrictions were first imposed on April 23 for one month following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India retaliated on April 30 by announcing a reciprocal closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines.Since then, both sides have repeatedly extended the curbs. On May 23, Pakistan prolonged its ban after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. Another NOTAM later extended the closure from June 23 to July 24, stating, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The tit-for-tat measures have left carriers from both countries barred from flying over each other’s territory, with every extension keeping the restrictions in place.",Pakistan extends airspace ban on indian aircraft until september 23.

Poll What is the most important factor to improve India-Russia trade relations? Stronger economic policies Better technological collaboration

NEW DELHI: On a visit to Moscow, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has suggested measures to further expand the trade relationship and to address the trade deficit of $58.9 billion that has resulted from India's increased oil procurement from Russia. The minister said this trade imbalance needed to be addressed urgently.Ahead of Jaishankar's meeting with his counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Thursday, Russia said in a statement that the main emphasis would be on promoting transportation, logistics, banking and financial chains independent from countries imposing sanctions, as well as expanding the use of national currencies in mutual settlements.Addressing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, removing bottlenecks in logistics, promoting connectivity, effecting payment mechanisms smoothly and early conclusion of the India-Eurasian Economic Union FTA, whose terms of reference were finalised on Wednesday, were some of the measures he suggested to diversify trade relations and address the imbalance.Also read: Russia: Oil supply to go on, 'special system' to deal with sanctions ""They will not only help to address the imbalance and grow our trade, but also hasten the timely achievement of our revised trade target of $100 billion by 2030,"" said Jaishankar, co-chairing the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGC-TEC) with Russia's first deputy PM Denis Manturov.Jaishankar called for promoting connectivity through the International North-South Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route and the Chennai-Vladivostok Corridor, and also sought timely finalisation and execution of the Programme of Economic Cooperation till 2030.Also read: Trump’s 25% additional tariffs loom: Indian refiners delay orders for Russian crude oil; take cautious approach On Thursday, Jaishankar will hold talks with Lavrov during which both sides will discuss regional and global issues, including developments related to the Russia-Ukraine war.

India tests its most formidable Agni-5 missile,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-its-most-formidable-agni-5-missile/articleshow/123413406.cms,"NEW DELHI: India successfully tested its most formidable nuclear-capable Agni-5 ballistic missile, which has a strike range of over 5,000-km to reach even the northernmost parts of China, from the integrated test range at Chandipur in Odisha on Wednesday.“The launch validated all operational and technical parameters. It was carried out under the aegis of the Strategic Forces Command (SFC),” the defence ministry said in a brief statement.The test comes over a year after the Agni-5 was tested for the first time with a multiple-warhead capability or MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) technology under 'Mission Divyastra' on March 11, 2024.It will take a few years for the Agni-5 with MIRV to become operational after multiple tests. A MIRV payload basically means a single missile carrying three-four nuclear warheads, each programmed to be released at different speeds with different trajectories to hit different targets that can be hundreds of kms apart.As of now, the tri-Service SFC, which was established in 2003 to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal, only has single-warhead ballistic missiles in its arsenal.They range from the Pakistan-specific Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles to Agni-2 (2,000-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km) and the near ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) Agni-5, which are largely geared towards China.“The test of the solid-fuelled, three-stage Agni-5 on Wednesday was a routine training trial carried out periodically by the SFC of already inducted missiles,” an official said.Significantly, the Agni-5 is a canister-launch missile, with a mated warhead in a ready-to-fire configuration. The hermetically-sealed canisters, while protecting the missiles from the environment, give the SFC the requisite operational flexibility to store them for long periods, swiftly transport them through rail or road, and fire it from wherever they want.India is also steadily working towards strengthening its nuclear triad, with the naval leg set to be augmented with the commissioning of a third SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine armed nuclear ballistic missiles) as INS Aridhaman this year. The first two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, are already operational.Parallelly, DRDO and the SFC have also been conducting “pre-induction night trials” of the new-generation and canister-launch Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range from 1,000 to 2,000-km and will gradually replace the Agni-1 and Agni-2 missiles in the country’s nuclear arsenal.China, of course, has ICBMs like the DongFeng-5 and DF-41 with ranges over 12,000-km. It is also adding around 100 nuclear warheads every year to its existing stockpile of 600 warheads.As per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) released in June, China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country and is likely to touch 1,500 warheads by 2035. India, in turn, has 180 warheads and Pakistan 170.","India successfully tested its most formidable nuclear-capable agni-5 ballistic missile.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at President Donald Trump's sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support. While the city faces challenges from the tariffs, its history of resilience and community pride remains strong, showing that even amidst political and economic uncertainty, Brantford continues to honor its iconic roots.In tense political times, can “The Great One” be both a Donald Trump supporter and a beloved hero in Canada? Some want him to pick a side.","Brantford, ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend wayne gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as u.s. tariffs on canadian goods take effect.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.As the 2025-26 NFL season nears, the New York Giants made some big moves at the quarterback position this offseason. Brian Dabboll and the front office brought in former Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson to replace Daniel Jones.","Russell wilson's wife and grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.

Recently, Tom Brady shared an Instagram carousel from The Hills in East Quogue, N.Y., featuring a golf day with his 17-year-old son, John “Jack” Edward Thomas Moynahan. The cover photo showed Jack looking taller than Brady, who is listed at 6-foot-4. Former teammates and friends jumped into the comments, turning a routine post into a light roast.Brady captioned the gallery, “Everything still pretty much the same ‘round here ⛳️ @nobull [sic].” On cue, the replies rolled in on Instagram.“Jack is way more beastly than you,” Rob Gronkowski wrote.Mike Evans added, “Is Jack standing on something? Besides business lol,” while Michael Rubin joked, “Except I heard Jack kicked your a– yesterday!!”Brady shares Jack with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan . He also has son Benjamin, 15, and daughter Vivian, 12, with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen.The golf outing came days before Brady’s return to the booth alongside play-by-play partner Kevin Burkhardt.

Reports suggest he wants to pursue basketball, adding another spotlight to being the son of one of the most famous athletes in the world. Brady has admitted the pressure is real, saying at the Fortune Global Forum in New York last year, “To be a boy, it sucks to be Tom Brady’s son in so many ways, and I try to empathize with them.”","Tom brady shared an instagram carousel with his 17-year-old son, jack.
