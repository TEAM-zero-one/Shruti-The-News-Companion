Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united.

Royer got 5 trained in terror in Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Two former jihadist operatives from the US, one of whom allegedly even attended Lashkar-e-Taiba’s training camp in Pakistan in 2000, and engaged in terrorist activities in Kashmir, including firing at Indian positions, have been appointed by the Trump regime to the White House Advisory Board of Lay Leaders .Ismail Royer and Shaykh Hamza Yusuf , co-founder of Zaytuna College , were listed despite their alleged affiliations with Islamic jihadists and proscribed terror groups, said Lara Loomer, a prominent ally of US President Donald Trump.Loomer, who was a big factor in the sacking of Trump’s National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, termed the appointment of Royer as “insane”. As per a White House statement, Royer serves as director of the Islam and Religious Freedom Action Team for the Religious Freedom Institute .Royer, who was Rendell Royer till he converted to Islam in 2000, was convicted by a US court in 2004 and handed a 20-year jail sentence for terrorist activities that targeted Americans — specifically, as part of the ‘Virginia Jihadi Network’. He was investigated by the FBI and in 2003, indicted on terrorism-related charges, including conspiracy to wage war against the US and providing material support to al-Qaida and LeT. He pleaded guilty in 2004 to aiding and abetting the use of firearms and explosives, receiving a 20-year sentence but serving only 13 years, Loomer posted on X on Saturday.In his plea agreement, Royer admitted to aiding and abetting co-defendant Masoud Khan, Yong Ki Kwon, Muhammed Aatique, and Khwaja Mahmoud Hasan in gaining entry to a terrorist training camp in Pakistan operated by LeT, where they trained in the use of various weapons, including semi-automatic pistols.Royer also admitted to helping co-defendant Ibrahim Ahmed Al-Hamdi gain entry to the LeT camp, where Al-Hamdi received training in the use of a rocket-propelled grenade in furtherance of a conspiracy to conduct military operations against India.Loomer said a second appointee to the advisory board — described by the White House as co-founder of Zaytuna College, the first accredited Muslim liberal arts college in the US, and an adviser to the Center for Islamic Studies at Berkeley’s Graduate Theological Union — also has a jihadi background. “I like to inform you that Shaykh Hamza Yusuf @yusuf is also a jihadi who has lied about the true definition of jihad and is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. Zaytuna College, which was co-founded by Hamza Yusuf @sh_hamzayusuf , teaches Sharia Law,” she posted.","Ismail royer and shaykh hamza yusuf were listed despite their alleged affiliations with islamic jihadists and proscribed terror groups. Royer, who was rendell royer till he converted to islam in 2000, was convicted by a us court in 2004 and handed a 20-year jail sentence for terrorist activities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121242309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
The inside story of a seamless Operation Sindoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-inside-story-of-a-seamless-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121241911.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the Adampur Air Base in Jalandhar.

Operation Sindoor

Resolute political will

Choice of targets

Closing intel gap

They knew it was coming

Choice of weapons

Air defence held firm

Threat within Pakistan

Missing ‘strategic depth’

Navy, the amplifier

Staying the course

Wars always generated a fog of claims and counter-claims. Did the Americans deliberately target civilians? Did a cynical Saddam Hussein use hospitals and schools as shields? It was always difficult to sift the truth from the lies, but the problem now has become even more acute with that much more information manipulation by the combatants.During Operation Sindoor, the same game played out, but one thing has now become abundantly clear: India won the latest round decisively. Indian armed forces have given enough information, backed by photographs and satellite images, leaving little room for disputes by sceptics and biased pundits masquerading as objective neutral parties. The assertions have been backed by independent military strategists and experts.TOI, based on accounts from multiple high-level insiders, who obviously spoke on the condition of anonymity, pieced together how India executed Operation Sindoor.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was busy with his engagements in Saudi Arabia when news of the attack on tourists in Pahalgam started trickling in. As soon as the magnitude of the massacre — the sheer monstrosity of the act, the fact that only Hindu men were targeted — was clear, Modi made up his mind that this would not go unpunished.The terrorists had even taunted wailing family members of victims that this was a message to Modi. The PM cut short his visit and on the way back told his colleagues to start preparing for retaliation against terrorists and their patrons.The consultations in the Cabinet Committee on Security and with the defence and intelligence leadership were not about “if” we should retaliate. It was solely focused on “where and when”, sources told TOI. In 2019, Modi had called Pakistan ’s nuclear bluff when he ordered the air strike on the jihadi hub of Balakot in response to the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy.He was determined not to let that be an obstacle this time around as well despite alarmist predictions about Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir being a jihadi in olives who had a restless finger on the nuclear button. India also factored in that China and Turkiye were standing by Pakistan, that a large number of Indian troops were stationed along the China border, and also that the West was again getting spooked by Pakistan’s scare-mongering. None of this dimmed India’s resolve which was articulated by the PM in Madhubani.The 2016 surgical strikes after the terror attack at an Army camp in Uri signalled the intent not to let the LoC come in the way of India’s pursuit of justice. The govt climbed up a couple of steps in the escalation ladder through the air strike on Balakot — a revered spot in the jihadi imagination.This time, the message had to be stronger and, hence, the selection of Muridke and Bahawalpur, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, which had been responsible for almost all the major terror attacks on India, beginning with the audacious one on Parliament in 2001 and including the amphibious army-type assault on Mumbai in 2008. The headquarters of Hizbul Mujahideen and other areas in POK, which were the staging ground for attacks, were part of the ‘to-hit’ list drawn up with the help of meticulous intelligence the govt already had.Forty-odd buildings were priority targets and the objective was to inflict damage that was visible, lethal and served to amplify the message: “We know who you are, where you are and how to get you.gPainstaking intelligence gathering over the past 10 years has helped India take care of what has for decades been a major handicap vis-a-vis its hostile neighbour. The success of Operation Sindoor only served to confirm what had been speculated over the past couple of years: that India has closed the intelligence gap.A combination of humint and techint helped India pin the exact locations, down to the buildings that served as the residential quarters of the leaders of Lashkar and Jaish inside the sprawling complexes at Muridike and Bahawalpur. Ten members of the family of Masood Azhar died. He himself barely escaped an Indian missile. Such was the extent of the losses that the Pakistan army had to depute its senior ranks to attend their funeral: an act of solidarity which blew apart the fiction of jihadi outfits being non-state actors.Uri and Balakot had left little room for doubting the Modi govt’s intent. Right after the Pahalgam attack, speculation was rife that India would target terror hubs, especially the jihadi universities at Muridke and Bahawalpur. It was also certain that Pakistan, caught napping twice, would have ramped up defences around its “prized assets”, thus eliminating the room for India to spring a surprise. Yet, two weeks after the Pahalgam massacre, India decided to hit the very same targets. Sources refused to confirm if it was because our intelligence had signalled that Pakistan had lowered its guard. It certainly created a “bol ke mara, jo kaha so kiya” moment for the govt and the forces.Intelligence also helped India exploit a chink in Pakistan’s air defence. The Rawalpindi GHQ and their Chinese handlers had designed a shield to defeat any attack that involved planes and missiles. But they did not take into account India’s stock of loitering munitions (a type of drone). A deadly addition to the inventory, loitering munitions fly at low altitude to dodge regular air defence, hunt and hover over the target with exact coordinates fed into it, before striking with precision.Over the past few years, India has built an impressive arsenal of the stealth weapon, largely sourced from overseas through the Emergency Purchase route, but now increasingly being produced domestically too. Combined with longrange Made-in-India drones, they took a heavy toll on the nine terror targets. Once they had got the “free hand” from the PM, defence and intelligence officers started working on the execution of Operation Sindoor.What helped them were multiple simulations the three Services had run, enabling near-perfection in the implementation. The four-day operation saw them work together: a perfect example of the muchaspired-for “jointness” that India has sought to achieve in recent years. There is speculation that some of the most ferocious strikes were achieved through weapons fired by Navy personnel.The destruction near Lahore of the HQ-9 missile defence system, a copycat version of the Russian S-300, and a strategic gift from China, marked a major blow to Pakistan, both materially as well as psychologically. But this was only a prelude to the major unravelling of Pakistan’s air defence.Their air bases, including strategic ones, which are home to F-16s and Chinese-made J-10s, and those located next to the headquarters of Strategic Plans Division that handles their nukes, became vulnerable. Open to missile and drone attacks, it exposed the hollowness of Bunyanum Marsoos, the ‘wall of lead’ that Pakistanis had claimed to have built. As against this, India’s own air fortification remained intact.A combination of the legacy antiaircraft guns, surface-to-air missiles, particularly the portable ones, battle-proven Pechoras, indigenously developed Akash, and S-400 that India acquired from Russia in 2018 in defiance of US’s threat of sanctions, turned out to be “the wall”. In another example of jointness, the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and the Army were supplemented by those of the Navy.As a result, all our air bases remained safe and operational. Pakistan’s claims about the destruction of the Adampur air base were proven to be fiction on Tuesday when Modi landed there on his special plane to address the jawans, with S-400 Triumph batteries forming a defiant backdrop. The military success announced India’s fullscale readiness for new-age warfare and will go a long way in enhancing confidence of the armed forces in “Make-in-India” weapons.Pakistan had limited options of widening the theatre of war by opening a front on the land border. With the Baloch insurgency developing into a front within, Gen Asim Munir could have withdrawn the Chaklala-headquartered X Corps — tasked with defending Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir — from Balochistan, but only at a huge risk. Attacks by Balochistan Liberation Army, even during the hostilities with India, only further shrank the space for manoeuvre.The vulnerability of Pakistan’s skies and the high possibility of Baloch snipers aiming at long convoys meant that the 26 division — the mechanised division based in Bahawalpur — could not be brought to the border either.Pakistan had wanted to turn Afghanistan into a client state, hoping that its control over its neighbour would give it strategic depth in any confrontation with a conventionally superior India. The retreat of the US and the installation of a Taliban regime was supposed to be the fulfilment of the dream of the planners at Rawalpindi GHQ.Unfortunately for them, the new regime in Kabul has refused to be pliant and an accessory, leading Islamabad to ironically accuse them of not controlling Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. It has also made it necessary for Pakistan to deploy a sizeable number of its troops in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. Staunch solidarity of the majority in KP with jailed former PM Imran Khan and the fear that his supporters would erupt in the streets against the Pakistan army further tied Islamabad’s hands.It did not join the action as such. But its offensive posture clearly signalled India’s intent and readiness to respond to any escalation. Ships resorted to aggressive manoeuvres on a night when Indian missiles had hit targets in Karachi’s immediate vicinity.The message was that India was more than willing to broaden the theatre to cover all domains, and Pakistan got the message. As Vice Admiral AN Pramod said, the Indian Navy ensured that the enemy’s air force remained “bottled up” on the Makran coast.Stoking the West’s fears of a nuclear conflagration and capitalising on it has for decades been Pakistan’s playbook. The tactic was deployed again and it worked, with Western capitals offering unsolicited counsel to New Delhi to de-escalate. The Modi govt, however, refused to flinch and maintained that terrorists needed to be made accountable and India has the right to defend its citizens. The message, in its most stark form, was conveyed by the PM to US vice-president J D Vance on the evening of May 9. Vance had called to convey “intelligence” about Pakistan planning a massive retaliation.“They can do whatever they are planning to, but India’s response will be even stronger,” Modi is learnt to have told Vance. That Modi really meant “goli ka jawab gole se” became evident in hours. After the IAF humiliated Pakistan by hitting its prized air bases, external affairs minister S Jaishankar got a call from US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Saturday morning, saying that Pakistan was ready to discuss a ceasefire.India’s first response was to escalate the strikes on Pakistan’s air bases before its Director General of Military Operations Lt General Rajiv Ghai decided to connect with his counterpart Maj Gen Kashif Abdullah. The biggest takeaway for Pakistan and the world at large: Since the global community is unable or unwilling to force Pakistan to change its behaviour, India is ready to execute the task on its own, despite significant risks. And it is sure the people will back a govt that is ready to go to the farthest lengths.",Prime minister narendra modi was busy with his engagements in saudi arabia when news of the attack on tourists in pahalgam started trickling in.

We appreciate the government for recognising the talent vacuum within the BJP and choosing a Congress leader to represent the country,” the party said.“We are confident that Shashi Tharoor will present India's case at the global level and correct the mistakes made by the Modi government,” the post added.The statement comes a day after the government announced plans to send around 40 parliamentarians to various parts of the world to highlight Pakistan's continued support for terrorism.The MPs will brief the international community about Pakistan’s ongoing involvement in cross-border terrorism and draw attention to India’s recently launched Operation Sindoor.The 10-day tour is expected to commence on May 23, with delegations likely to visit key world capitals including Washington D.C., London, Abu Dhabi, Johannesburg, and Tokyo.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is leading the coordination efforts for the initiative.

Supreme Court Criticizes Repeated PILs on Rohingya Deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-irked-by-repeated-pils-to-stop-rohingya-deportation/articleshow/121220210.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday was irked by successive attempts through PIL to stop alleged deportation of Rohingya Muslims within a fortnight and told senior advocate Colin Gonsalves that he can’t be filing PIL after PIL on the same issue without any new fact to seek modification of SC’s May 8 decision refusing relief.On May 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had refused to grant interim stay on apprehended deportation of Rohingyas despite spirited arguments from Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan. The bench had said Rohingyas, who are not Indian citizens, do not have a right to reside anywhere in the country.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said India is not a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees and disputed validity of UNHCR granting refugee status to Rohingyas, who are from Myanmar and had fled to other countries because of serious threat to their lives from the military.On Friday, Gonsalves said on May 8 itself the Union govt had deported 28 Rohingyas, who were handcuffed and taken to Andaman Island, given life jackets and pushed towards Myanmar. After somehow reaching Myanmar, they took help of fishermen to make phone calls to their relatives in Delhi to inform them that they faced imminent threats to their lives.The bench of Justices Kant and Singh said these are bald averments and who is there to verify these facts are true to his knowledge. “When the country is facing such a situation at present, you cannot come up with fanciful PILs like this. There is no material to support vague and sweeping allegations made in the petition. Unless the petitioner provides prima facie credible material, it is difficult to pass an interim order which is contrary to the one refused on May 8 by a 3-J bench.”Gonsalves cited a SC judgement on protection of Chakma refugees to seek similar relief for Rohingyas. He also cited a UN Report as well as an order of the International Court of Justice to claim that Rohingyas are not migrants but refugees whose protection of lives is mandated by the UN.The bench said, “We do not want to comment on the UN Report today. We will give an answer to that on July 31, when this petition along with the pending one would be taken up for hearing.” Gonsalves said this would allow govt to deport more Rohingyas, whose number exceed 8,000 in different parts of the country and 800 of them are in Delhi.","Supreme court irked by successive attempts through pil to stop alleged deportation of rohingya muslims within a fortnight.

"With Operation Sindoor still on, military gets emergency purchase powers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-operation-sindoor-still-on-military-gets-emergency-purchase-powers/articleshow/121241511.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: With India making it clear that the cessation of hostilities under Operation Sindoor is only a ‘strategic pause’ if Pakistan does not mend its ways in fuelling cross-border terrorism , govt has granted emergency procurement (EP) powers to the armed forces with an overall outer limit of around Rs 40,000 crore.The EP-6 approval for Army, IAF and Navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council just a few days ago, officials told TOI on Saturday.The first four EPs were granted during the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, while the fifth was for counter-terror operations. Under EP-6, the armed forces can fast-track multiple contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore, under both capital and revenue heads instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.“The contracts have to be finalised within 40 days, with deliveries to be completed in one year. The powers will be exercised by the three Service vice chiefs,” an official said.This will allow the armed forces to quickly build their arsenals of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition.There is a 15% cap each on the total capital and revenue procurements of the overall defence outlay earmarked for the ongoing fiscal. “All EP-6 purchases have to take place with the concurrence of the financial advisors, while special permission is needed for imports,” the official said. “While the actual expenditure is likely to be less than the overall 15% outer limit, it gives the Services the requisite flexibility to meet urgent operational gaps and replenish their ammunition stocks depleted in the four days of intense hostilities from May 7 to 10,” he added.IAF jets, for instance, used BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which are jointly produced in India with Russia, the Israeli-origin air-to-ground Crystal Maze-2 and Rampage missiles and Spice- 2000 precision-guided bombs, and French-origin Scalp cruise missiles and Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions, for their precision strikes, as earlier reported by TOI. IAF also used Israeli Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones.Similarly, Army units launched loitering munitions like SkyStriker as well as fired ‘smart’ extended range artillery shells like Excalibur to hammer specific targets.The armed forces also used a wide array of weapons as part of the multi-layered air defence network. They included the Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missiles, jointly developed with Israel, and the indigenous Akash missiles.","The ep-6 approval for army, iaf and navy to further boost as well as replenish their arms stockpiles was granted by the rajnath singh-led defence acquisitions council.

The inside story of a seamless Op Sindoor

BJP: Sharif words prove Op Sindoor’s boldness

NEW DELHI: In a first formal acknowledgment, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has confirmed that the Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi was struck during the night of May 9–10, when India carried out missile strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases. This admission is significant as it corrects the narrative surrounding the cross-border hostilities, as previous Pakistani statements had either downplayed or denied the extent of the damage inflicted during the Indian operation.“On the night of May 9 and May 10, at around 2.30 am the Army chief called me from a secure line call that India, through its ballistic missiles had attacked us. One missile hit the Nur Khan airbase and some others have hit other areas,” Sharif said.The Pakistan PM made this statement during his speech at a ceremony titled ‘Youm-e-Tashakur’ (Thanksgiving) on what Islamabad claims is a “sham celebration” on the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-e-Haq against India. During the ceremony in Islamabad, he detailed the chain of events that triggered Islamabad’s response to India. And while he summarised the events, he conceded and established the Indian claim that Nur Khan airbase was hit with Indian missile strikes .Reacting to Sharif’s admission, BJP on Saturday reasserted that it was a confirmation about scale, precision and boldness of Operation Sindoor. “Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif himself admits that General Asim Munir called him at 2.30am to inform him that India had bombed Nur Khan Air Base and several other locations. Let that sink in — the Prime Minister was woken up in the middle of the night with news of strikes deep inside Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: On the intervening night of May 9 and 10, the Indian Air Force (IAF) destroyed 11 of Pakistan's 12 airbases, retaliating against Islamabad targeting 26 locations across India as a response to the successful ""Operation Sindoor.""India's air defence systems, however, thwarted Pakistan's attacks.According to an ANI report, the subsequent counter-strikes on airbases of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) began with the Indian forces sending across ""dummy pilotless aircraft."" These were camouflaged to appear as IAF jets on enemy radars.As expected, the PAF radars and air defence network got activated to take down the Indian 'incoming aircraft.' The IAF then launched the loitering munitions, including the Israeli-made Harops, targeting Pakistan's air defence radars and command and control systems.Pakistan's air force had to mobilise its entire set of its HQ-9 air defence missile system launchers and radars to different locations; some of these were detected following activation, despite being deployed at new locations.The IAF then followed up with its long-range missiles, including the BrahMos and Scalp, using these to attack the Pakistani air bases. As per reports, around 15 BrahMos, as well as the Scalp, Rampage and Crystal Maze, were launched in the offensive.The strikes marked the first time that the BrahMos, a supersonic cruise missile system, has been used in an active conflict.The damages were so extensive that the PAF was forced to shift its aircraft to different bases in the rear. Also, it is likely to have lost a significant number of long-endurance drones and an airborne early warning and control aircraft during an IAF missile hit on a hangar at an airbase in the Sindh province.Defence sources told ANI the intensity of the strikes made Pakistan drop its plans for a counter to the capitulation of its air defence system. Islamabad urgently requested DGMO (Director General of Military Operations)-level talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" with New Delhi to put a pause to all military action going forward.The DGMO talks were held at 3:35 pm on May 10. Around two hours later, the two sides announced the ceasefire.","The indian air force (iaf) destroyed 11 of pakistan's 12 airbases, retaliating against islamabad targeting 26 locations across india.

Espionage case: Arrested Haryana YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra linked to expelled Pakistani official - 10 points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/espionage-case-arrested-haryana-youtuber-jyoti-malhotra-linked-to-expelled-pakistani-official-10-points/articleshow/121237184.cms,"Image credit: Jyoti Malhotra's Instagram

Here are ten key points regarding the case:



Jyoti, who runs a YouTube channel with 3,77,000 subscribers, is accused of communicating with a Pakistani employee at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi. On May 13, India expelled that Pakistani official on charges of espionage. The police said that she maintained contact with Pakistani handlers and allegedly transmitted sensitive information through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Snapchat. She made contact with Ehsan-ur-Rahim, also known as Danish, at the Pakistan high commission in 2023 while applying for a visa to visit the neighboring country, according to the FIR. She met Danish multiple times at the Pakistan high commission in Delhi and was reportedly in contact with Pakistani intelligence operatives, the FIR said. She traveled to Pakistan twice, met Danish’s acquaintance Ali Ahwan, who arranged her stay there. Ahwan also facilitated her meetings with Pakistani security and intelligence officials, including Shakir and Rana Shahbaz. To avoid raising suspicion, Jyoti saved Shahbaz’s mobile number under the name ‘Jatt Randhawa.’ A photo posted by Jyoti Malhotra on March 22, 2025, showed her alongside two other Indian YouTubers, with a caption claiming they were at the Pakistan high commission. According to police, Jyoti admitted to sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence operatives and disguising their contacts with misleading names to evade detection. Officials said that her sustained communication with these operatives constitutes a violation of the Official Secrets Act and poses a serious threat to national security. She has been charged under applicable provisions of the Official Secrets Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita by Civil Lines police in Hisar. She was arrested just a day after a 25-year-old postgraduate student, suspected of connections with Pakistani intelligence operatives, was taken into custody in Kaithal. Meanwhile, Nauman Ilahi, a 24-year-old from Panipat district, was also arrested on charges of allegedly providing sensitive information to contacts in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Haryana YouTuber and travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra was arrested on Saturday in a case related to spying for Pakistan. She has been accused of sharing sensitive information with an official at Pakistan high commission who was expelled on charges of espionage on May 13.Her YouTube channel, which features a total of 487 videos, includes several documenting her visits to Pakistan, with titles such as “Indian Girl in Pakistan,” “Indian Girl Exploring Lahore,” “Indian Girl at Katas Raj Temple,” and “Indian Girl Rides Luxury Bus in Pakistan.”The arrest comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan over Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22.","Jyoti malhotra, who runs a youtube channel with 3,77,000 subscribers, is accused of communicating with a pakistani employee at the pakistan high commission in delhi.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor reacted to the Centre’s decision to include him in all-party delegation — despite his party not nominating him — by saying the government selected “who they felt was appropriate” for the role. He added that the Congress party was entitled to its opinion of his ""abilities or lack thereof"".""The party is completely entitled to its opinion. Clearly, it's been a government delegation and government has its own opinion as to who they felt appropriate,"" he said speaking to reporters on Saturday.""My party leadership is entitled to its opinion of my abilities or lack thereof, and I think that is really for them to explain. I have absolutely no comment to make on that. I am honoured to have been entrusted with the responsibility, and I will fulfil that responsibility just as I have fulfilled every responsibility entrusted to me in my rather long working life, whether at the United Nations or in the Congress Party,"" he added.Amid political backlash from the Bharatiya Janata Party over non-inclusion of his name by the Congress, Tharoor categorically mentioned that ""this has nothing to do with party politics"".""To my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics. It's all to do with what our country has been through in recent times and the need for us to present a united front...It is a good reflection of national unity at a time when unity is important,"" he said.After Tharoor accepted the invitation to lead one of the delegations, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh took a jibe saying, ""The Congress is like the mighty Ganga, which has many tributaries… Some of them dry up and some get polluted.""He further said that individual MPs included in official delegations are expected to seek their party’s concurrence, adding that if the government nominates an MP, it is the MP’s responsibility to consult their party before accepting the role.Tharoor later clarified that he informed his party regarding this: ""Certainly, I informed them (the party) of the first call I got, which was two days ago. I also mentioned to the parliamentary affairs minister that I assumed that he would be talking to the party leaderships of opposition parties, and he assured me that he would be,"" he said.The apparent rift between Tharoor and the grand old party was picked up by the BJP with Amit Malviya questioning whether Congress' stance came from a place of ""insecurity, Jealousy, or simply intolerance of anyone who outshines the high command"".""No one can deny Shashi Tharoor’s eloquence, his long experience as a United Nations official, and his deep insights on matters of foreign policy. So why has the Congress Party — and Rahul Gandhi in particular — chosen not to nominate him for the multi-party delegations being sent abroad to explain India’s position on key issues? Is it insecurity? Jealousy? Or simply intolerance of anyone who outshines the ‘high command’?"" he said.The all-party delegations will represent India’s unified political stance and unwavering commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms. The outreach follows Operation Sindoor — launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives — during which India carried out precision strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists.","'some get polluted,' congress' jibe at tharoor; 'jealousy?'

India approves Rs 40,000 cr to fast-track military purchases amid Operation Sindoor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-emergency-defence-procurement-power-india-approves-rs-40000-cr-to-fast-track-military-purchases-amid-operation-sindoor/articleshow/121239505.cms,"PTI file photo

What is

emergency defence procurement power

?

Emergency defence procurement power allows the armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Under it, the equipment must be delivered quickly—often within 3 to 6 months.

The powers are activated during conflict, tensions, or natural disasters.

Financial limits are set for each procurement cycle, allowing the military to negotiate directly.

This mechanism was used in previous border clashes and now during Operation Sindoor.

According to ministry of defence, for items previously supplied by defence PSUs or ordnance factories, the government can issue Letters of Intent (LoI) to speed up procurement before a full contract is signed.

To ensure oversight, a high-level defence ministry committee ensures that rules are followed and no irregularities occur in large contracts.

The Indian defence forces are set to make emergency purchases worth Rs 40,000 crore to enhance combat readiness during Operation Sindoor . The defence acquisition council, chaired by senior defence and military officials, have approved the spending to ensure timely procurement of critical equipment.Key systems being prioritised under the emergency powers include surveillance drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions, and various types of missiles and ammunition. Some of these, like the BrahMos and Scalp cruise missiles, have already been deployed against Pakistani targets. The Rampage missile, also used in the strikes, was initially procured under similar emergency provisions.These emergency powers ensure that the equipment is received within a strict timeline, helping meet immediate operational requirements. This is the fifth such tranche of emergency procurement since 2019. Procurement teams from all three services will coordinate with defence finance advisers to manage purchases efficiently.Indian public and private defence firms, including Bharat Electronics and Solar Defence, are expected to receive orders for low-level radars and other high-tech systems. The forces also plan to acquire more Heron Mark 2 drones , which have been instrumental in surveillance during Operation Sindoor.Given the current conflict and its evolving demands, the Indian government may consider additional funds for defence needs in future budgets.","Emergency defence procurement power allows armed forces to bypass standard procurement timelines for urgent military needs.

Indian girl visited Pakistan 🇵🇰High Commission for Iftar Dinner party🇮🇳Got invitation by embassy

Who is Jyoti Malhotra?

NEW DELHI: A video posted by now-arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra - known online as Travel With Jo - has emerged as key evidence of her alleged connections with Pakistani officials.In the clip posted in March last year, filmed during an Iftar dinner at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, Malhotra is seen warmly praising the arrangements, expressing repeated interest in visiting Pakistan, and ""hopefully"" getting a visa.The video also captures Malhotra in conversation with Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a Pakistan High Commission official. She appears to be well-acquainted with him, referring to previous meetings and speaking comfortably with his wife, suggesting a level of familiarity beyond casual acquaintance.According to investigators, Malhotra initially travelled to Pakistan in 2023 whilst participating in a delegation visit. During her stay, she encountered Danish. After returning to India, she maintained contact with him.Following Ahsan's recommendation, she undertook a second journey where she was introduced to Ali Ahsan, who connected her with operatives from Pakistan's intelligence services. Officials indicate that she subsequently began transmitting classified information to these contacts.Jyoti Malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from Hisar, Haryana, who gained popularity through her YouTube channel Travel With Jo, which has over 377,000 subscribers. Her content typically features international travel vlogs, including several videos from Pakistan — the most recent of which was uploaded just last month. Branding herself as a cultural ambassador, Malhotra often portrayed a message of cross-border harmony in her videos.However, this public image has now come under scrutiny following her arrest on Saturday for allegedly spying for Pakistan. According to authorities, Malhotra violated the Official Secrets Act by sharing sensitive information with Pakistani intelligence handlers, posing a threat to India’s national security.She is currently in police custody as further investigations continue.","Jyoti malhotra is a 33-year-old travel content creator from hisar, haryana.

India's Operation Sindoor diplomacy: Why BJP is pushing Shashi Tharoor but Congress is not,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-operation-sindoor-diplomacy-why-bjp-is-pushing-shashi-tharoor-but-congress-is-not/articleshow/121235301.cms,"Aaj ka event bahut logon ki need kharab kar dega

NEW DELHI: The news of Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation of MPs on India's outreach program over Operation Sindoor may not have surprised many, including the Congress leader and his party. In the last two weeks, Tharoor has been one of the vocal supporters of the Narendra Modi government on the India-Pakistan standoff. So much so, that the Congress was forced to officially announce that Tharoor's statements were his own views and not the official stand of the party.There is absolutely no doubt that Tharoor, who is a former diplomat and has a rich experience in international relations, is one of the best persons to lead India's diplomacy offensive against Pakistan on Operation Sindoor.But when Congress suggested four names for the job, Tharoor's name was missing.The government, however, went ahead and named a seven-member delegation that included Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, and Supriya Sule, among others.Following the announcement, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh lashed out at the government saying that party chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi had suggested the names of Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain, Raja Brar, and Anand Sharma, none of whom made it to the final list.This sparked a sharp response from the BJP. Spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress of internal hypocrisy. “So Jairam Ramesh opposes his own Congress colleague Shashi Tharoor for being chosen to lead a Parliamentary delegation!” he posted on X. “Why does Rahul Gandhi oppose every individual who speaks for India, even in his own party?”BJP’s Amit Malviya also took a dig, suggesting the Congress leadership was uncomfortable with anyone who overshadowed the party’s ‘high command’.Meanwhile, Tharoor welcomed the government's decision clearly stating that to his mind, ""this has nothing to do with party politics"".""When the nation needs my services, I am available and I'm available for my country. To my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics. It's all to do with what our country has been through in recent times and the need for us to present a united front ... It is a good reflection of national unity at a time when unity is important,"" the Congress MP said.His collegue Jairam Ramesh, however, in veiled jibe said, ""Congress mein hona aur Congress ka hona mein zameen-aasmaan ka antar hai (There is a difference between being in the Congress and of the Congress).""In the recent past, Tharoor’s unflinching support for the government during the India-Pakistan standoff has raised eyebrows within his party. His statements have been so in line with the government that critics say he’s behaving more like a BJP spokesperson than an opposition MP.While the Congress has expressed support for the armed forces and Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 Pahalgam attack, it has also raised questions on Trump's claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The government has said that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan's DGMO.However, Tharoor has publically dismissed Trump's claims, in sharp contrast to party's stand. ""I see it as a particular politician wanting to take credit for something and I can see that the government of India probably said - let them take the credit if they want to,"" Tharoor said. The Congress MP also praised the government's messaging on the issue.When some Congress leaders tried to draw parallels with the 1971 war and Indira Gandhi’s leadership, Tharoor distanced himself from that narrative too.""Today's Pakistan is a different situation. Their military capability and the potential damage they can inflict are different. Bangladesh was a moral cause — this is not the same. A war today would be long and bloody. Is that India’s top priority? No, it isn’t,"" Tharoor said.This isn’t the first time Tharoor has found himself at odds with the Congress over his praise for Prime Minister Modi government’s foreign policy. Earlier, Tharoor admitted that he was ""left with egg on the face"" for opposing India's stance when the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in 2022. The former UN diplomat-turned-politician also praised the outcome of PM Modi's meeting with Trump at the White House.In February, Tharoor posted a selfie with Union minister Piyush Goyal and praised the government for reviving the long-stalled free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK. The Thiruvananthapuram MP had also praised the government for its 'Vaccine Maitri' initiative, which facilitated the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to several countries.Earlier this month, as PM Modi shared stage with Tharoor during inauguration of Vizhinjam port in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram, PM also took a swipe at Congress saying, “(Today’s event is going to disturb the sleep of many).""Tharoor’s inclusion in Operation Sindoor outreach surely reflects his diplomatic stature and global credibility, but it also highlights a departure from party's stand. The Congress, like any other opposition party, would want its representative to support the government as far as fight against terror is concerned but not give clean chit or justify almost all government policies as Tharoor has done in the last one week.","Shashi tharoor to lead a delegation of mps on india's outreach program over operation sindoor.

AHMEDABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that India’s military response to Pahalgam terror attack struck deep into Pak territory and left the neighbouring country ‘afraid’.“For the first time since Independence, our armed forces destroyed terror camps 100km inside Pakistan. Pak thought it would threaten us with atom bombs, & we would be scared. But our armed forces gave them a befitting reply. Our three armed forces responded to bricks with stones,” Shah, who is on a two-day visit to Gujarat, said in Gandhinagar district’s Kolavada village.Shah said our armed forces eliminated nearly 100 terrorists, destroyed the headquarters of terror outfits, and also destroyed 15 military air bases, which eventually reduced the Pakistan air force’s ability to hit back. He said PM Narendra Modi himself gave the name ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ in honour of the country’s women.He said that before Modi became PM, terrorist attacks used to take place at regular intervals for years. “Terrorists backed by Pakistan routinely killed our soldiers, bombed our cities, and plotted with impunity. No strong response was ever given,” Shah said.“During the tenure of PM Modi, India saw 3 terror attacks backed by Pak — Uri, Pulwama, and Pahalgam. In all three instances, India gave a befitting reply.
