'Finally travelling in same direction': BJP's Baijayant Jay Panda shares selfie with Shashi Tharoor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/finally-travelling-in-same-direction-bjps-baijayant-jay-panda-shares-selfie-with-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/119312454.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party national vice-president Baijayant Jay Panda on Friday shared a selfie with Congress leader Shashi Tharoor from a flight on social media.However, what caught the attention was the BJP leader's quirky caption, ""My friend & fellow traveler called me mischievous for saying that we seem to be finally travelling in the same direction.""The selfie comes days after Tharoor's ""egg on face"" remark on India's Russia-Ukraine stance which gave ammunition to BJP to corner Congress.The BJP highlighted Congress leader Shashi Tharoor's praise of India's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war , calling it an endorsement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diplomatic acumen.Senior BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP Ravi Shankar Prasad welcomed Tharoor’s admission that his initial criticism of the government’s neutral stance on the war was misplaced.

""We are emerging as a friend to the world, and this is precisely what a senior Congress leader has recognised.""Tharoor, a former minister of state for external affairs, had admitted on Tuesday that India’s approach allowed Modi to maintain strong ties with both Russia and Ukraine.

""They should recognize India's unique global standing and appreciate Tharoor for his candid acknowledgment,"" Patra said.","The selfie comes days after tharoor's ""egg on face"" remark on india's russia-ukraine stance.

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Norhtern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete. Meanwhile, India is caught in its own existential spiral—still believing happiness is to be earned, still chasing Jefferson’s promise of “the pursuit”, still demanding meaning from its journey. But as Camus warns, meaning is a human construct. The world owes us none.","World happiness report 2025 ranks india 118th among 147 countries.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Friday said it is ready to rebuild ties with Canada, which has taken a hit over Ottawa harbouring anti-India elements.The ministry of external affairs said the downturn in relations between both nations was caused by the Trudeau-led Canadian government giving license to the extremist and secessionist elements.""The downturn in India-Canada relations was caused by the license that was given to the extremist and secessionist elements in the country. Our hope is that we can rebuild our ties based on mutual trust and sensitivity ,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a press briefing.Over the past several months, relations between New Delhi and Ottawa have experienced significant strain, primarily due to the presence of Khalistanis, who actively work against India's national security.In October 2024, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian government agents of involvement in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , a Canadian citizen and prominent Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia.This allegation led to a diplomatic crisis , with both nations expelling senior diplomats. Canada's federal police claimed to have credible evidence of Indian agents engaging in illegal activities on Canadian soil, including intelligence gathering and interference in democratic processes.The situation further deteriorated when demonstrations near a Hindu temple in Brampton, Ontario, were dispersed by police after weapons were reportedly spotted among participants. This event followed a violent protest involving Khalistani terrorists opposing a visit from Indian consular officials.In response to these developments, India invoked the provision of parity in Canada's diplomatic presence, citing concerns over interference in its affairs by Canadian personnel.External affairs minister S Jaishankar stated that the relationship between the two countries was going through a difficult phase and indicated that India might resume issuing visas to Canadians if there was progress in ensuring the safety of Indian diplomats in Canada.However, Justin Trudeau on January 6 announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party, citing internal conflicts that hindered his ability to effectively lead into the next election.The chances of improvement in ties appeared after Mark Carney was named the new Canadian Prime Minister. Carney has, in the past, expressed a positive outlook on India, particularly regarding its economic growth and commitment to clean energy.","The ministry of external affairs said the downturn in relations between both nations was caused by the trudeau-led canadian government giving license to the extremist and secessionist elements.

FBI shares tips for travelers to stay safe over spring break



Establish points of contact for your family to reference in the event of an emergency.

Avoid traveling alone, especially after dark. Be conscious of your surroundings and avoid areas you believe may put your personal safety at risk.

Use only authorized taxis/shuttles. Passengers have been robbed or kidnapped when using taxis.

Avoid actions that are illegal, improper, or indiscreet. Avoid offers of sexual companionship; they may lead to a room raid, photography, and blackmail.

Evade criminals by being aware of your surroundings and alert to the possibility of surveillance. Take mental notes of anyone following you and promptly report it to the appropriate security officials.

Beware of new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.

Was there any foul play in Sudiksha Konanki's disappearance?



As 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki 's disappearance from a beach in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic remains a mystery, FBI Los Angeles has warned spring break travelers to take certain precautions and be extra vigilant while travelling. Virginia's Konanki went to DR on a vacation from where she mysteriously disappeared with officials initially thinking that she drowned. Her body was not found to date.The case came to a heartbreaking conclusion with Konanki's parents urging the DR officials to declare her officially dead so that they could move on with their lives, grieve and respect the memories of Konanki.FBI Los Angeles told travelers to check the State Department's travel advisories — about security threats overseas. ""Whether it’s families looking to escape the final throes of winter or a college student seeking a brief respite from the rigors of academic life, know that the risks are there,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said in a statement. ""Maintain vigilance throughout your travels and be prepared to contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate should the need arise.""In the Caribbean, Haiti has the highest and level 4 travel advisory, meaning ""do not travel,"" followed by Jamaica at level 3, which means US citizens should ""reconsider travel.""Sudiksha's parents initially suspected foul play and insisted that she could not drown. Joshua Riibe, a 24-year-old man from Iowa, who was last seen with Konanki was detained and questioned. He said he went to the sea with Konanki when they were caught in strong waves. He fought against the waves and pulled Konanki out of the rough waters and then passed out on the shores. He said when he woke up in the morning, Konanki was not there. Konanki's parents now believe Riibe was not involved in any foul play and they thanked him for cooperation in the probe following which Riibe was allowed to come back home from DR.","Sudiksha konanki, 20, went missing in dominican republic.

Trump takes questions from reporters after announcing fighter jet contract

A well-publicized visit by Elon Musk to Pentagon on Friday threw the American strategic community into a tizzy with feverish accounts in the legacy media that has was going to be briefed on US war plans against China . The fact that Musk has extensive business interests in China rattled a constituency that sees the billionaire as an interloper in Washington's conduct of foreign affairs and strategic planning.But President Trump broke the China fever.""The Fake News is at it again....China will not even be mentioned or discussed. How disgraceful it is that the discredited media can make up such lies,"" Trump said, hours after ""the Failing New York Times"" said, incorrectly according to him, that Musk is going to be briefed on any potential war with China."" He called the report ""ridiculous.""But the legacy media doubled down on the story. The Washington Post, citing ""people familiar with the matter,"" following up the NYT ""scoop"" by insisting the Pentagon briefing for Musk -- to include classified slides and battle-specific plans -- focused on the threat posed by China, and not just the billionaire’s work to slash the U.S. government bureaucracy.Musk himself was agitated enough with the story to warn that he looks forward to the ""prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT,"" calling the paper ""pure propaganda.""The denial did not quell the disquiet among Chinaphobes, who raged that the Trump dispensation is disclosing military secrets to a billionaire with extensive business interests in Beijing.""China is to Musk what Russia is to Trump,"" the former chess champion Gary Kasparov, now a commentator on strategic affairs said. Others pointed to Musk’s dual role as a private-sector billionaire with Pentagon contracts and now potentially a military advisor on China.China, as Tesla’s second-largest market in the world after the U.S., accounts for nearly a quarter of the company's $100 billion revenue. Tesla’s largest manufacturing facility is located in Shanghai, producing over half of Tesla’s global vehicle output—approximately 1 million cars annually out of nearly 2 million vehicles delivered worldwide. The factory was built with significant support from Beijing, including $1.4 billion in low-interest loans from state-owned banks.The Pentagon though maintained that the Musk briefing focused on ""innovation, efficiencies, and smarter production,"" aligning with his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a Trump administration initiative aimed at reducing federal government waste and bureaucracy. The Pentagon has a budget of around $ 900 billion.The Wall Street Journal later reported that Musk was originally scheduled to receive a briefing on top-secret plans -- including operational blue prints -- for a potential war with China, but the idea was scrapped after the story leaked.",Elon musk's visit to pentagon on friday threw the american strategic community into a tizzy.

Economic fallout of the shutdown

Hundreds of thousands of passengers faced major disruptions on Friday as London’s Heathrow Airport, Europe’s busiest travel hub, shut down for the day following a fire at a nearby electrical substation. The blaze caused a widespread power outage, forcing airlines to cancel or divert at least 1,350 flights, including multiple transatlantic journeys.Counter-terrorism officers leading the investigation into the fire found no evidence of foul play, according to the Metropolitan Police.A police spokesperson confirmed: “We are working with the London Fire Brigade to establish the cause of the fire, which remains under investigation. While there is currently no indication of foul play, we retain an open mind at this time.”Also read: Heathrow airport shut: Video shows massive fire raging overnight Given the fire’s impact on critical infrastructure, the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command has taken charge of the probe. Authorities said the unit's specialist resources would help expedite the investigation to determine the cause and minimise disruptions.The closure of Heathrow had a significant ripple effect across global air travel, with flights cancelled or redirected to alternative airports. Several international carriers were forced to adjust their schedules:Heathrow Airport announced plans to resume some flights on Friday following a major fire at an electrical substation that caused a power outage at Europe’s busiest airport, disrupting travel for hundreds of thousands of passengers. The airport stated it would start flying out passengers who had been diverted to other European airports and work to reposition aircraft. Full operations are expected to resume by Saturday.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband described the fire as an unprecedented event, which not only knocked out Heathrow’s primary power supply but also took down its backup generator. The London Fire Brigade confirmed that flames erupted from a transformer at an electrical substation about two miles from the airport late Thursday night, affecting more than 16,300 homes and businesses in the area.Also read: Heathrow Airport power outage: Air India cancels all flights to London Firefighters battled the blaze for over seven hours, finally bringing it under control by early Friday morning. Assistant commissioner Pat Goulbourne praised the efforts of emergency teams, saying they successfully contained the fire and prevented further damage.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer thanked emergency responders and acknowledged the widespread distress caused by the airport closure.“I know the situation at Heathrow is causing distress and disruption, especially for those travelling or without power in their homes. I’m receiving regular updates and I’m in close contact with partners on the ground,” he posted on X.The disruption has drawn comparisons to the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut down much of European airspace for five days, grounding millions of travellers.Several schools in Hayes have been forced to close following the fire, Hillingdon Council has confirmed.The schools affected include:The London Fire Brigade stated that the fire started in a transformer within the substation, a critical part of the national grid responsible for regulating electricity distribution. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.Beyond school closures, the impact of the substation fire has extended to Heathrow Airport, leading to widespread disruption. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled or diverted, affecting an estimated 145,000 passengers. The financial fallout for airlines could reach hundreds of millions of pounds, according to aviation analysts.Heathrow, the world’s fourth-busiest airport in 2023, relies on precise coordination of aircraft and crews. The disruption is expected to last for days, with airlines scrambling to reposition planes and staff. British Airways has already begun redirecting inbound flights, urging passengers to check for updates before travelling.Experts warn that the closure will have ripple effects on businesses dependent on the airport, including cargo firms, retailers, and local communities. With shares of major airlines falling, the financial strain is likely to persist as Heathrow works to restore normal operations.","Flames erupted from a transformer at an electrical substation about two miles from the airport late thursday night.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed. Chief Justice John Roberts himself --- a Conservative Republican Bush appointee -- is under attack from MAGA for not consistently ruling in favor of Trump and resisting the move to impeach liberal judges.""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!""

Terry Bradshaw’s political shift: Why the NFL legend chose to stay neutral



Terry Bradshaw , the legendary NFL quarterback turned television personality, has taken a rare path in the often politically charged landscape of professional sports. While numerous celebrities and sports figures have openly voiced their political opinions, especially since Donald Trump ’s initial presidential campaign a decade ago, Bradshaw has opted for a more reserved approach. Unlike several high-profile NFL names who have publicly backed Trump, Bradshaw has consciously chosen to remain politically neutral—a stance that reflects both his evolving political beliefs and his desire to avoid alienating fans.Donald Trump has received notable endorsements from influential NFL figures, including Hall of Fame quarterbacks Brett Favre, John Elway, and Fran Tarkenton. Current NFL stars like Nick Bosa, Gardner Minshew II, and Harrison Butker have also shown public support for the former president. However, at 76, Terry Bradshaw has stood apart by choosing not to align himself with any political party.In a 2020 interview with Business Jet Traveler, Bradshaw opened up about his political shift. After being a longtime Republican, Bradshaw made the decision to switch political parties and register as an Independent. His reasoning was straightforward and pragmatic: ""I've been a Republican, but now I'm a registered independent. I don't want to alienate anyone, and the minute you say, 'I'm a Democrat' or 'I'm Republican,' you're kicking off the other side. I want the best person [in the White House], and I'll pick the one who's most like the way I feel.""Bradshaw’s move reflects his desire to remain open-minded and focused on leadership qualities rather than party loyalty. His switch mirrors a growing sentiment among public figures who feel constrained by rigid political affiliations. Notably, other athletes like Danica Patrick and Charles Barkley have also made similar moves in recent years.While Bradshaw has generally avoided taking sides, he has not shied away from criticizing political decisions when he feels compelled to speak out. One of the most notable instances came during Donald Trump's presidency when the former president condemned NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. Bradshaw was vocal in defending the players' right to protest, emphasizing the core values of American freedom.""This is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it's freedom. People died for that freedom. I'm not sure if our President understands those rights—that every American has the right to speak out and to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love this great country of ours,"" Bradshaw stated. He further added, ""Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL.""Bradshaw’s remarks underscored his belief in free expression and the importance of focusing on larger national issues rather than politicizing sports. His balanced approach allows him to maintain credibility and connection with a broad audience, avoiding the divisiveness that often comes with strong political statements.Despite his political shift, Bradshaw remains a prominent figure in the NFL world. As a key part of FOX’s broadcasting team, he continues to be a familiar face to football fans every week.

Heathrow Airport: Air India cancels all flights to London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/heathrow-airport-power-outage-air-india-cancels-all-flights-to-london/articleshow/119288270.cms,"MUMBAI: Air India has announced significant disruptions to its London operations after Heathrow Airport suspended all services due to a major power outage. The suspension, which will remain in effect until 23:59 London time on March 21, has forced the airline to cancel multiple flights and divert others to alternative destinations.Flight AI129 from Mumbai is returning to its origin, while AI161 from Delhi has been diverted to Frankfurt. The airline has also cancelled all remaining flights to and from London Heathrow scheduled for March 21, including the morning flight AI111. Air India's services to London Gatwick remain unaffected, according to an Air India spokesperson.The closure of one of the world's busiest aviation hubs was triggered by a severe fire at a nearby electrical substation in Hayes, west London. The incident, which occurred in the early hours of March 21, required an emergency response of ten fire engines and approximately 70 firefighters from the London Fire Brigade, said media reports.The transformer fire caused widespread power disruptions affecting thousands of homes and businesses in the surrounding areas. Safety measures included the evacuation of around 150 people and the establishment of a 200-meter security cordon around the affected site.The impact on global air travel has been substantial, with over 1,300 flights affected, according to flight tracking websites. Major carriers including Qantas Airways and United Airlines have been forced to reroute their aircraft to alternative European airports such as Paris and Shannon.Heathrow Airport authorities have advised passengers to avoid traveling to the airport and to maintain contact with their airlines for updated flight information. The situation remains dynamic as authorities work to restore power and resume normal operations.This is not the first time Heathrow has faced significant operational challenges. The airport experienced a major shutdown in December 2010 due to heavy snowfall, which resulted in thousands of flight cancellations over several days. In July 2013, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner fire on the tarmac also caused temporary disruptions.The current power outage presents a particular challenge for Air India, which operates multiple daily flights between Indian cities and London Heathrow. ""The airline's decision to cancel all Heathrow operations for the day reflects the severity of the situation and the uncertainty surrounding power restoration at the airport,"" said an airport source.While flights to London Gatwick continue as scheduled, the disruption at Heathrow has left many passengers seeking alternative travel arrangements. The timing of service resumption remains unclear, with airport authorities continuing to assess the situation.The incident highlights the vulnerability of major aviation hubs to infrastructure failures and the cascading effect such disruptions can have on global air travel. As engineers work to restore power to the affected areas, airlines and passengers alike await further updates on when normal operations at Heathrow can resume.Air India said it will provide updates about the resumption of operations as soon as more information becomes available. Passengers are advised to monitor the airline's official communications channels for the latest updates on flight statuses and alternative arrangements.","Heathrow airport has suspended all services due to a major power outage.
