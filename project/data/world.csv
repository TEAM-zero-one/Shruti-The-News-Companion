Poll Do You Think Countries Should Focus on Securing Affordable Energy Supplies? No, Sustainability Should Be the Priority Yes, It’s Essential for Economic Stability

NEW DELHI: India has reasons to get excited about Donald Trump's 'Drill, Baby, Drill' slogan, which has become the leitmotif of the 47th US president's policy to make America rich again by producing, consuming and exporting more oil and gas.More oil and gas in the market means lower prices, something India needs to maintain the growth momentum as it is heavily dependent on imports. India meets more than 80% of oil and 50% of gas requirement through import.""What is President Trump saying. Let the era of high prices be over. Let's control economic inflation. Let's bring more energy on the market. Let's have more economic growth so that everybody can win. Now, I'm the energy minister of the world's third largest consuming and importing country. We have the fourth largest refining capacity. Frankly, these are music to my ears,"" Union Petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said at India Energy Week in Delhi.The US is the world's biggest oil producer at over 13 million barrels per day. It produces oil in 32 states and coastal waters. Trump's choice of fracking services executive Chris Wright as energy secretary is, therefore, being seen as a signal that the president may be banking on an encore to reach his policy goal.Recent analyst notes from major brokerages, however, have been muted in their outlook on production increase as Wall Street focus on reducing costs for value creation. Oil production is a long game. Given the low oil prices, the fracking scene is not likely to see a rush of investors.That said, more US supplies are likely to reset global energy flows, in addition to keeping prices in check. Rising US oil exports will naturally tend to replace Gulf supplies to Europe. This will be an advantage for Indian refiners at a time when they are looking for alternatives to make up for loss of discounted Russian crude due to the latest US curbs on Russian oil sector.India does import crude from the US, which had made it to the list of top five suppliers. But it is not always the first choice due to high shipping costs and long travel time. Future prospects will depend on the available arbitrage, where India has an advantage with a diversified basket of 38 or so countries.But Russia is the elephant in the room. Given Trump's recent overture to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the war could be headed for an end. If, and when, that happens, India can say cheers with more oil in the market.",The us is the world's biggest oil producer at over 13 million barrels per day.

US plane with second batch of 119 deported Indians lands in Amritsar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-plane-with-second-batch-of-119-deported-indians-lands-in-amritsar/articleshow/118284273.cms,"(PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: A planeload of 119 illegal Indian immigrants from the US landed in Amritsar on Saturday making it the second deportation flight this year. This is one of the two flights of deportees expected to land in the country this weekend, news agency PTI reported, quoting official sources.It comes a day after PM Modi and US President Donald Trump vowed to address the issue during their bilateral talks. PM Modi had categorically mentioned the need to end the ecosystem that exploited people and ""fooled (them) with big dreams"" to travel to the US illegally.However, there was no discussion on the treatment meted out to the deportees, who were shackled and handcuffed on the US military aircraft, drawing criticism from the opposition leaders.Last week, a US military plane with 104 deportees landed in Amritsar drawing flak from the Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann. The CM slammed the central government and called it an effort to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis"" by turning the city into ""a deportation centre"".""This is a deliberate attempt to send out the message that only Punjabis travel illegally,"" Mann said, adding that the Centre should ""divert the aircraft to Delhi or Ahmedabad. Punjab govt will bring back Punjabis with honour. But we maintain that illegal immigration is not just Punjab's problem, but a national one.""India is the largest source of illegal immigration to the US outside Latin America, with over 7,25,000 undocumented individuals, according to US officials.Amid rising MAGA-driven opposition to immigration, which affects over a million Indian professionals and students on legitimate H-1B, L, and F1 visas, Indian officials have pushed back, emphasizing their economic contributions and the role of people-to-people ties in strengthening US-India relations .",119 illegal indian immigrants from the us landed in amritsar on saturday.

"Shashi Tharoor praises PM Modi's US visit, 'something good has been achieved'; Congress says 'views are personal'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-praises-pm-modis-us-visit-something-good-has-been-achieved-congress-says-views-are-personal/articleshow/118280251.cms,"'Does not reflect opinion of party'

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from PM Modi ’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He welcomed the trade deal discussions and expressed optimism over India’s diplomatic engagements.However, his remarks prompted a clarification from the Congress party , which said that individual opinions do not reflect the party’s official stance.He stressed that when someone in the government does the right thing, it should be recognised, irrespective of who's in power.“For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it.”“If I were to praise all the time, no one would take me seriously. If I were to criticise all the time, no one would take me seriously either… There’s got to be some give and take in democracy,” the Congress MP said.Tharoor also welcomed the progress on trade talks between India and the US, saying that an agreement had been reached to conduct negotiations over the next nine months. “It’s far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian,” he said.On illegal immigration, he questioned whether Modi had raised concerns over the treatment of Indian nationals deported from the US. “There are some questions that still remain… Why did the question of the way in which those illegal immigrants were returned to India not get addressed? Did PM Modi raise it behind closed doors?”He further elaborated, “The only thing missing from what Prime Minister Modi said was the question of the manner in which those people were treated and sent back. I think otherwise his stand was absolutely correct. These are misled youth who have been encouraged or induced to migrate illegally, and they should be taken back. If they are Indian citizens, they belong in our country, we take them back. But I hope that something was said behind closed doors, not perhaps in the press conference, but inside privately, that this manner of doing it—the handcuffs, the insults, the mistreatment, the military aircraft—all that should be avoided in future.”On Trump calling PM Modi a better negotiator than himself, the Congress MP called it an ""astonishing"" acknowledgment. He noted that Trump, known for branding himself as a master dealmaker, rarely compliments others, especially in areas he considers his expertise.""I think calling Mr. Modi a better negotiator than himself is astonishing because Mr. Trump takes pride in being this sort of art of the deal that is his strength. And his admirers, including yesterday the defense secretary of the US, had said that Mr. Trump is the greatest negotiator in the world.""""And here Mr. Trump says Mr. Modi is better than him. So I think we are looking at a very high degree of praise from a man who is not known for saying praiseworthy things. So this is good news,"" Tharoor said.Following Tharoor’s comments, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to social media to clarify the party’s position without directly naming Tharoor. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Indian National Congress is our country’s ONLY political party where there is absolute freedom of speech as well as freedom after speech. Members give their views on issues which are, on occasion, their own and do not reflect the opinion of the party as a collective entity. It is the party’s stance that is paramount.”","'does not reflect opinion of party' says congress general secretary jairam ramesh. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from pm modi’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He questioned whether modi had raised concerns over the treatment of indian nationals deported from the us.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118280258,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1095209,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

A third US flight carrying Indian deportees is expected to also land on Sunday, PTI reported, quoting official sources.When it was pointed out that the Centre had probably chosen Amritsar as the landing point for deportation flight as it was nearer to the US than other Indian airports, Mann shot back: ""If Amritsar is so close, then it would make sense to start flights from here to the US and Canada as we have been demanding.""Sixty-five of Saturday's deportees are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, 8 from Gujarat, two each from UP, Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, and one each from HP and J&K , PTI quoted official sources as saying, adding that 119 had been expected but an updated passenger manifest had been provided later.BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said in a post on X on Saturday, in which Mann was tagged, ""Amritsar is the closest international airport for flights entering India from the US"" and that was why the US plane was landing there"".Mann also questioned the appropriateness of allowing a US military plane to land in a city close to the border, saying, ""Other countries are sending their civilian planes to bring back their deportees, so why are we allowing a US military plane to land here?""

Those from Punjab will be transported to their native places by road.Family members of some deportees who came to the airport expressed dissatisfaction with the Punjab govt's rehabilitation efforts.The relatives of Harjit Singh (22) and Harjot Singh (20), were deeply depressed. They had spent 45 lakh on each of the cousins to send them to the US. Their uncle, Nishan Singh, said the two young men from Khanowal, in Gurdaspur, had reached the US just 10 days ago but were caught and deported. He added that a US-based travel agent had assured them of legal entry into US.CM Mann, Union junior minister for railways Ravneet Singh Bittu and Congress MP from Amritsar Gurjeet Singh Aujla had visited the airport for some time earlier in the day.Mann, asked at Saturday's press conference whether Indian deportees would be in restraints, said state govt did not have any information about this, and that PM Modi should have raised the issue with Donald Trump when he met him.","Us aircraft carrying 116 illegal indian immigrants landed in amritsar.

That's how the world's leading universities are coping with AI, according to Michael Spence , University College London ( UCL ) president & provost.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit here Saturday, Spence said: ""There are three things we need to teach our students - the skills the machines will never have (like) interpersonal and cross-disciplinary skills. Then, we need to teach them to use the machines. My vice provost research is a cognitive neuroscientist who works on the consciousness of AI.

Interestingly, almost everybody came back and said a deep understanding of the discipline.

PM: Be it key nations or int'l platforms, confidence in India stronger than ever

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday said the Centre would soon set up a deregulation commission to ease the compliance burden on society and minimise govt interference.""We have ended hundreds of compliances, and now with Jan Vishwas 2.0, we are further reducing compliances. To reduce govt interference in society, a deregulation commission is also being established,"" said Modi, referring to the raft of measures undertaken in the past 10 years to revamp the complex web of laws and regulations.Addressing the ET Now Global Business Summit, Modi also said govt sees the private sector as a key partner in the country's journey towards transforming itself into a developed nation and asserted that fear of business has been transformed into ease of doing business.He said that tax relief announced in the latest Union Budget would strengthen the middle class and boost economic activity. ""To support the middle class, we have increased the limit of 'zero tax' from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 12 lakh in this year's budget. Due to this decision, the entire middle class would be strengthened, economic activity in the country will increase further. This has been made possible because of a proactive and sensitive govt,"" he said.India is now at the centre of discussions on the global future, and is leading them too, PM Narendra Modi said at the ET Now Global Business Summit on Saturday.""Today, be it major nations or global platforms, confidence in India is stronger than ever,"" he said.While previous govts undertook reforms because of compulsion, his govt has been implementing them because of conviction, he remarked.Modi, who returned from his visit to the US and France after meeting US President Donald Trump, said 25 crore Indians have risen out of poverty in just the past 10 years and will join the 'neo-middle class'.The PM said govt has taken measures to open up several sectors for the private sector, including the space sector, and detailed how startups are contributing to this crucial sector. He also referred to the drone sector, which has been opened up, and said it has paved the way for a wide range of opportunities for the country's youth.He said govt was taking steps to encourage the private sector in the power distribution sector to drive more efficiency. ""In this year's budget we have taken a major reform measure. We have opened the nuclear sector for private participation,"" the PM said, adding that India missed the first three industrial revolutions but is ready to move forward with the world in the fourth.Modi highlighted that India entered in the top 5 largest economies in the world in just the last decade, denoting the speed of development of Viksit Bharat. He said people would soon witness India becoming the third largest economy in the world in a few years. He emphasised that this was the necessary pace for a young country like India and stressed that India was moving ahead with this very speed.Modi detailed the reforms undertaken in the past 10 years which he said has transformed India's economy. He said the banking sector was reformed and now public sector banks have reported record profits and access to credit has been accelerated to cover a wide section of the population, including the poor, with ""banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded"" being the govt's strategy.He said such initiatives may not have generated headlines, but changed the lives of all across the country. ""Swamitva Yojana has resulted in the recognition of rights of properties, enabling people in poor sections of the society to access loans, which are now far more easily available because of the growing network of bank branches and banking correspondents. Property worth Rs 1 lakh crore have been unlocked,"" the PM said, quoting a UN study.""This is the real story of reform - perform and transform,"" said the PM, adding that reforms earlier were undertaken only due to compulsion but now they were being taken with conviction.Reforms undertaken by his govt have strengthened the pillars of the economy, he said, while also mentioning that the private sector is benefiting from GST. Modi also referred to the reforms undertaken to revamp the colonial era Indian Penal Code and bring about tthe Bharatiya Nyay Samhita.PM Modi also referred to the steps taken to transform backward districts and pointed to the development in the Aspirational Districts. He said govt had worked on the indicators on which these districts were lagging behind. ""Many aspirational districts have now transformed into inspirational districts of the nation,"" Modi said and now steps are being taken to improve micro level governance with the aspirational blocks programme.In his welcome address, Vineet Jain, MD, The Times Group, highlighted the transformative policies undertaken by Modi govt. ""The Bharat we see today is a result of a decade of economic decisions and transformative policymaking.

Concerns over Constitutional interpretation



NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Friday questioned the involvement of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in executive appointments , such as that of the CBI director, stating that it was time to ""revisit"" such norms. Speaking at the National Judicial Academy in Bhopal, he also raised concerns over the jurisprudential basis of the ‘doctrine of basic structure.’“To stir your minds, how can in a country like ours or in any democracy, by statutory prescription, the Chief Justice of India participate in the selection of the CBI director?” Dhankhar said, according to PTI reported. “Can there be any legal rationale for it? I can appreciate that the statutory prescription took shape because the Executive of the day has yielded to a judicial verdict. But time has come to revisit. This surely does not merge with democracy. How can we involve the Chief Justice of India with any executive appointment!"" he added.The Vice President criticised what he termed as ""executive governance by judicial decree,"" calling it a ""constitutional paradox that the largest democracy on the planet cannot afford any longer."" Dhankhar emphasised that all institutions must function within their constitutional boundaries.“Governments are accountable to the legislature and periodically to the electorate. But if executive governance is arrogated or outsourced, enforceability of accountability will not be there,” he said. He added that any interference in governance by the legislature or judiciary was “antithetical to constitutionalism.”Dhankhar acknowledged the importance of judicial review, stating, “Judicial review is a good thing as it ensures that laws conform to the Constitution.” However, he stressed that the ultimate authority to amend the Constitution rests with Parliament.“The judiciary’s public presence must be primarily through judgments. Judgments speak for themselves… Any other mode of expression… undermines institutional dignity,” he remarked.On the basic structure doctrine , which restricts Parliament from altering certain fundamental features of the Constitution, Dhankhar said its jurisprudential basis was “very debatable.” Citing a book by former Solicitor General Andhyarujina on the Kesavananda Bharati case, he noted, “Having read the book, my view is that the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution has a debatable, very debatable, jurisprudential basis.”Recalling his tenure as Parliamentary Affairs Minister in 1990, Dhankhar pointed out that the Supreme Court had only eight judges at the time, yet constitutional interpretation required a five-judge bench. “Please note, when this strength was eight, it (size of constitutional bench) was five. And the Constitution allows the highest court of the land to interpret the Constitution,” he said.However, he warned against the misuse of constitutional interpretation. “Under the guise of interpretation, there can be no arrogation of authority, and the essence and spirit which the founding fathers had in mind under Article 145(3) must be respected,” he asserted.Referring to the expansion of the Supreme Court, he stated, “If I analyze arithmetically, they were very sure the interpretation will be by a majority of judges, because the (total) strength then was eight. That five stands as it is. And the number (of total judges) is more than fourfold.”Dhankhar also underscored the importance of free expression in a democracy. “If the right to express oneself is throttled or diluted, democracy gets thinner and thinner and thinner,” he remarked.","Vice president jagdeep dhankhar questioned the involvement of the chief justice of india in executive appointments.

India needs to weigh pros & cons of F-35 pitch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-to-weigh-pros-cons-of-f-35-pitch/articleshow/118258672.cms,"F - 35

NEW DELHI: India will have to very carefully evaluate US President Donald Trump’s offer of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter, even though the IAF would love to grab it with both hands given the China factor, while the two countries take forward the procurement of six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft as well as joint production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles this year.The expansive India-US defence relationship will get a further boost with PM Modi and Trump “pledging to elevate” military cooperation across air, land, sea, space and cyberspace, institute the ‘Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance (ASIA)’, streamline defence trade and technology exchange, and sign a 10-year major defence partnership framework to renew the one inked in 2015.The sales pitch for the F-35, which is sold only to Nato countries and close allies, however, was the key takeaway. It might just be “a proposal” at this stage with the long-drawn formal process yet to even begin, as foreign secretary Vikram Misri said, but India will have to increasingly contend with a pushy Trump, whose deal-oriented transactional approach to geopolitics is well-known.“Starting this year, we will be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We are also paving the way to ultimately provide F-35 stealth fighters,” said Trump. The joint statement also noted the US’s “review of its policy on releasing fifth-generation fighters and undersea systems” to India.The pros and cons will have to be weighed. “India will inexorably be drawn into the US’s sphere of influence with the F-35 acquisition, impinging on its strategic autonomy. Why do you think successive Indian govts over the years have acquired Russian, French and other fighters but never American ones?” a senior official said.If India indeed pursues the F-35 offer, it will also have to factor in several things like the off-the-shelf price, the technologies being given, life-cycle costs, maintenance and the like, apart from the strategic benefits it can reap.Utmost care will have to be taken that India’s own 5th-Gen fighter project of the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), the development of which for over Rs 15,000 crore was cleared by the cabinet committee on security last March, is not adversely impacted.The operational 5th-Gen jets currently are the American F-35 Lightning-II and F/A-22 Raptor, the Chinese Chengdu J-20 and Russian Sukhoi-57. China has deployed J-20s at its airfields facing India and is even going to soon supply a variant to Pakistan, while it also conducted maiden flights of two new 6th-Gen prototypes in Dec.With the IAF grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorized 42.5, and Hindustan Aeronautics struggling to produce even a 4th-Gen Tejas, Indian national security planners are obviously concerned. “With AMCA still at least 10-12 years away from production, IAF will obviously be deeply interested in getting two to three squadrons (36 or 54 jets) of F-35s in the interim. If you need deterrence to prevent wars, you obviously need capabilities,” another official said.The F-35 could now even fly its way into IAF’s long-delayed project for 114 new multi-role fighter aircraft to be produced in India with foreign collaboration at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. The defence ministry is working to break the logjam over this project, where French Rafale, Russian Sukhoi-57, Swedish Gripen-E, Eurofighter Typhoon and American F-15EX are the contenders.There is also the lingering question of the Russian S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems being inducted under the $5.43 billion contract in Oct 2018. The US is wary of any country operating F-35s and S-400s together since the latter’s powerful radars can “map or record” data of the former’s stealth characteristics, electronic warfare and other capabilities. This, too, will need to be resolved.","The sales pitch for the f-35, which is sold only to nato countries and close allies, was the key takeaway.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk urged the United States to ""delete entire agencies"" as part of a broader effort under US President Donald Trump to cut government spending and reshape its priorities. Speaking via video call at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Thursday, Musk delivered a sweeping address touching on bureaucracy, artificial intelligence , and US foreign policy.""We really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people — democracy,"" Musk said, dressed in a black T-shirt that read ""Tech Support."" Jokingly referring to himself as the White House's ""tech support,"" he called for eliminating entire government agencies, warning against merely scaling them back.""If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back,"" Musk said, reinforcing his call for a fundamental restructuring of government institutions.Musk's appearance at the summit comes at a time when he has solidified his influence in Washington, particularly within the Department of government efficiency , where he has sidelined career officials and gained access to sensitive federal databases. His growing role in the Trump administration adds weight to his remarks beyond his well-known status as the world's richest person, with stakes in SpaceX, Tesla, and the social media platform X.His comments also reflected the administration's shift toward a more isolationist foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Addressing the UAE audience, Musk backed Trump's decision to dismantle the US agency for international development ( USAID ) and questioned the effectiveness of the national endowment for Democracy.""A lot of attention has been on USAID, for example,"" Musk said. ""There's like the national endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'Okay, well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'""He emphasised the administration's reduced interest in global interventions, remarking, ""The United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience.""AI, DEI, and a new "" Dubai Loop ""Musk also touched on the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, drawing a controversial link between DEI and artificial intelligence. ""If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there’s too many men in power and execute them,"" Musk said.On AI development, Musk revealed that X's AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, describing it as ""kind of scary."" He also took aim at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company he co-founded but later split from, after recently leading a $97.4 billion takeover bid. Musk criticised OpenAI's leadership, comparing it to an environmental nonprofit transforming into a logging company.In a nod to his infrastructure ambitions, Musk announced a new ""Dubai Loop"" project in line with his work at The Boring Company, which has been developing underground transportation systems in Las Vegas. ""It's going to be like a wormhole,"" he said. ""You just wormhole from one part of the city — boom — and you’re out in another part of the city.""Although details about the Dubai Loop are limited, Musk’s remarks highlight his ongoing influence in shaping both US domestic policy and global technological aspirations.

Trump-Modi Summit: $25 Deal, F-35 Jets, 26/11 Extradition | Key Takeaways From High-Stakes Meeting

Amid the launch of new initiatives, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the India-US partnership is central to a free and open Indo-Pacific. However, as Trump takes upon himself to resolve conflicts and in his own way, a glaring omission from the statement was any mention of the Russia-Ukraine war, or any stock reference to the UN Charter or territorial integrity on that issue, that had featured prominently in such bilateral and even multilateral documents with the Biden administration.According to the joint statement, the leaders also committed to strengthening law enforcement cooperation to take decisive action against illegal immigration networks, organized crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists human and arms traffickers, as well as other elements who threaten public and diplomatic safety and security, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations. India sees this as important for putting a check on the activities of Khalistan separatists on US soil. “There's a commitment to strengthening law enforcement cooperation in this regard and this is especially significant from our perspective given some events that have taken place,’’ said foreign secretary Vikram Misri. The leaders also publicly called upon Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism.According to government sources, Modi had detailed discussions with Trump about concerns on both sides regarding market access and the problems arising out of Chinese industrial overcapacity, while asking officials to conclude a mutually beneficial trade deal by fall this year. “They discussed concerns arising from other territories with over capacities that take advantage of consumption in countries like India and the US. They discussed ways and means to address these issues in an overall context,’’ said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The joint statement was also shorn of any focus on climate or global health, issues that made the cut with the previous administration.The Trump administration strongly backed initiatives like IMEEC and iCET although the latter seemed to have been rechristened TRUST (transforming the relationship utilising strategic technology). TRUST, according to the joint statement, will catalyse government-to-government, academia and private sector collaboration to promote application of critical and emerging technologies in areas like defence, AI, semiconductors and quantum computing, while ensuring protection for sensitive technologies. They agreed to finalise a US-India roadmap on accelerating AI infrastructure.While there was no direct mention of the conflict in West Asia, the leaders agreed to increase cooperation, enhance diplomatic consultations, and increase tangible collaboration with partners in the region. They highlighted the importance of investing in critical infrastructure and economic corridors to advance peace and security in the region, pledging new announcements this year to take forward IMEEC and I2U2 – comprising India, Israel, UAE and US – initiatives.On cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, as Quad partners, the leaders reiterated that this partnership is underpinned by the recognition of Asean centrality, adherence to international law, support for safety and freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, and unimpeded lawful commerce.“PM Modi looks forward to hosting President Trump in New Delhi for the Quad leaders’ Summit, ahead of which the leaders will activate new Quad initiatives on shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability,’’ said the joint statement. The 2 sides also launched the Indian Ocean Strategic Venture, a new bilateral forum to advance coordinated investments in economic connectivity and commerce.The leaders welcomed the proposed Indian amendments of the Atomic Energy Act and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA) for nuclear reactors, saying this path forward will unlock plans to build large US-designed reactors and enable collaboration to develop, deploy and scale up nuclear power generation with advanced small modular reactors.As expected, there was a strong condemnation of terrorism with Trump and Modi backing action against groups like LeT, JeM, ISIS and al Qaeda. As the US formally announced the extradition of Mumbai attacks accused Tahawwur Rana, the leaders called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, and Pathankot attacks and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.","Pm narendra modi and president donald trump reaffirmed in a joint statement that the india-us partnership is central to a free and open indo-pacific.

It has been amended nearly 65 times with more than 4000 amendments, year on year through Finance Acts, based on the evolving requirements of modifications in taxation Policy.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025: Read full text of proposed new I-T Act Tax administrators, practitioners and taxpayers have acknowledged the contribution ofthe Income-tax Act, 1961 in overall tax governance and economy. However, over the time concerns have also been expressed over the accumulation of amendments, the intricate language, detailed provisions, redundancies and the heavy structure of the Income-tax Act.The Income-tax Act is dynamic legislation requiring regular updating and amendments to reflect the nation’s changing economic, social, and political realities. Criminal and other civil laws do not undergo such frequent updating and amendments whereas the Income-tax Act is regularly updated (on annual basis) to reflect the economic changes, fiscal policies, and government priorities. It, therefore, adapts to changes in the economy, business environments, inflation rates, income sources, and global financial trends. The government has introduced tax reforms to encourage specific sectors of the economy while balancing the same with requirements of revenue collection and widening/deepening of the tax base. Given its direct link to taxation and economic conditions, the Act needs to be more adaptable to reflect shifting economic policies, changing incomes, inflation, and emerging industries. The dynamic nature of the Income-tax Act provides it flexibility to accommodate new economic trends.Examples:i. To promote exports, specific provisions such as 80HH, 80HHC were brought into the statute. The same having served intended purpose have been since omitted or made inapplicable after sun set date.ii. To promote infrastructure development, section 80IA was brought into Income-tax Act, 1961.iii. Sections 80HHE, 10A and 10AA were introduced for facilitating software exports.iv. Section 80IAC is yet another example of encouraging the start-ups.The income tax law has become increasingly bulky over time, with its traditional style of drafting and numerous amendments. The complexity of language in the present Act is a product of different factors. To keep pace with certain legal pronouncements, explanations and provisos were often inserted to clarify legislative intent. Changing taxation priorities also led to introduction of additional text to an otherwise simple provision. Further, certain provisions remained in the statute, despite becoming non-operational, in view of pending claims/issues from earlier years.Attempts have been made in the past, including those in 2009 and 2019 for simplification of the Income tax Act. The recommendations from these efforts, as regards policy, have been considered in the amendments carried out from time to time.Simplification of tax laws has received attention globally. Countries have undertaken similar exercises to enhance clarity and compliance in their taxation laws. In the UK, the process was carried out during the period 1994 to 2010 for simplifying the language. Before simplification, the UK Income and Corporation Tax Act, 1988 comprised 960 pages. However, after simplification, it was divided into five separate Acts, with their page counts increased, resulting in a more segmented but overall larger body of tax law.Also Read | New Income Tax Bill 2025 explained: 10 key takeaways for taxpayers - top points you should know Similarly, Australia underwent a similar process during 1994 to 1997, where simplification of language also resulted in a longer tax code.These international experiences emphasize the delicate balance between simplification and the need for clear, unambiguous legal language. Drawing from these lessons, effort has been made to focus not just on linguistic simplification but also on structural rationalization.The Hon’ble Finance Minister in the budget speech in July 2024 stated that the purpose of the comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is to make the Act “concise, lucid, easy to read and understand”.Following ground rules have been considered for simplifying the existing provisions:i. The Bill proposes to eliminate redundant provisions, reducing its length by nearly half.ii. The drafting style of the new Bill is straightforward and clear, making the provisions easier to understand by incorporating more than 57 tables compared to 18 tables in the Income-tax Act, 1961. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs. This minimises cross references and conflict by aggregating all applicable provisions related to a single scenario in one place.iii. All provisos (about 1200) and explanations (about 900) have been removed.iv. The 1961 Act contains numerous cross-references to sections, sub-sections, clauses, sub-clauses, items, and sub-items, making the provisions challenging to interpret. The new Bill adopts a simplified reference system, allowing provisions to be cited by simply mentioning the section. For instance, section 133 (1)(b)(ii) in the new bill would indicate sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 133 in the existing Act. This change makes the Act's language easier to understand.v. A significant aspect of the Bill is the elimination of the concepts of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’. Prior to 1989, the concept of ‘previous year’ and ‘assessment year’ had been brought because the taxpayers could have different twelve-month previous years for each source of income. From 1st April 1989, previous year was aligned to a financial year in all cases. However, ‘assessment year’ continued to be used for various proceedings under the Act. Thus, a taxpayer was required to track two different periods, i.e., the ‘previous year’ as well as the ‘assessment year’. This presented difficulties in complying to the provisions of the Act especially for a new taxpayer who had to keep track of ‘previous year’, ‘assessment year’ as well as ‘financial year’.Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime A comprehensive consultative process was undertaken for the simplification exercise. A total of 20,976 online suggestions for simplification and removal of redundancies were received, analysed and relevant suggestions were categorized into policy-related, language simplification, removal of redundant or obsolete provisions, etc. Meetings with industry and professional associations were held and field-level brainstorming sessions were held within the Income Tax Department, towards this exercise.At the international level, consultations were held with some of the taxation authorities that had undertaken similar exercise in the recent past, viz. the Australian Tax Office and Treasury, and the UK’s Office of Tax Simplification.The documents prepared in 2009 and 2019, were also referred, while undertaking the exercise. International and national guidance material such as ‘Drafting Guide for Simplification of Laws’ issued by Legislative Department, Ministry of Law and Justice, was studied for simplification of legal language.In addition to the stakeholder exercise mentioned in Q I.9, suggestions were sought from taxpayers, industry and professional associations, and field level officers of the Department. A committee of around 150 officers of the Department was actively involved in the entire exercise. The Committee prepared the draft text of various chapters, which was meticulously vetted by the Legislative Department of Ministry of Law and Justice, and consolidated in the form of the final Bill, after necessary approvals.More than 60,000 man-hours were dedicated by the team for finalising the new Bill.The readability of tax law has been improved by using simpler language, as against traditional legal language. Where multiple situations are covered, the sections have been made enumerative. Wherever feasible, extensive use of table formats has been made. TDS provisions have been presented in a tabular form. Certain provisions such as section 10, which contained about 150 clauses has been placed in Schedules and presented in the form of tables.As a result of the comprehensive exercise, the size of the new Bill has reduced by about half on one hand and one the other, the provisions have been consolidated and presented in a user friendly format.Provisos (more than 1200) and Explanations (more than 900) have been removed, with their simplified content placed as sub-sections or clauses. Wherever feasible, procedural aspects and specific details are proposed to be provided by way of Rules.Yes. Certain provisions became redundant due to numerous amendments and/or policy changes over the years. This resulted in large number of such provisions in the Act. For example, deduction under section 10A, which was a special provision for newly established industrial undertakings in the free trade zones, is no longer available from the Assessment Year 2012-13, onwards. Such obsolete provisions have been removed from the text of the Bill.However, provisions applicable to earlier Assessment Years shall be governed by Repeal and Savings provisions.In addition to removal of ‘provisos’, ‘explanation’ and redundant provisions, formulae, tables, and structures have been used to enhance clarity in the new bill. To the extent possible, provisions involving the same issues, which were present in different chapters in the current Act, have now been consolidated. Redundancy has been removed and definitions at multiple places have been consolidated.In case of provisions relating to Non-Profit organisations (NPOs), the entire text related to NPOs has been consolidated and structured into 7 sub-parts which contain provisions related to Registration, Income, Commercial activities, Compliances, Violations, Registrations for the purposes of eligibility of donations and Interpretations.The new Income-tax Bill is approximately half the length of the existing Income-tax Act 1961, with significant re-organisation of provisions in different sections. While undertaking simplification exercise, a conscious attempt has been made to minimise the scope of litigation and fresh interpretations. For this purpose:a. Key words/phrases, especially where courts have given rulings, have been retained with minimal modifications.b. Language has been simplified by use of short sentences to the extent possible.c. Sections have been translated into row or sub-rows in tables, reducing the number of words and bringing clarity.d. Provisions have been made clear to minimize scope for multiple interpretations. The provisos and explanations have been removed and simplified content has been placed as sub-sections and clauses.e.

Many a times such provisions were connected to already existing sections and accordingly the new sections were numbered in continuation to the existing sections. For example, several provisions relating to tax on special cases were inserted as sections starting with 115 series viz 115 AC,115AD, 115JB, 115VP etc.As a result of such insertions, effective sections existing in the Income tax Act, 1961 are 819.While the existing Income-tax Act contains 298 numbered sections, effective sections in the current Act are 819. This is because other than numeric section numbers there are large number of sections with alpha-numeric codes such as 115A to 115WM (117 sections) and so on. The Income-tax Act not only deals with levy of tax but it is a comprehensive document, which encompasses all aspects of tax administration. It also includes other aspects such as:(a) laying down the administrative framework, assigning roles and responsibilities for assessing officers, taxpayers, tax deductors, and professionals etc;(b) setting out the framework for income determination, timelines, appellate procedures, enforcement, assessments, and penalties; and(c) taking into account the impact of interpretations on economic policy, affecting both domestic and international investments.The new Bill proposes 536 sections to meet the above-mentioned requirements.Further, several sections in the new Bill exist primarily to honour the commitments under the existing tax regime, including provisions relating to Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), various deductions and exemptions, etc. These provisions will remain in force until their respective sunset clauses take effect. Therefore, these are required to be part of new Bill to ensure a smooth transition, while maintaining legal and policy continuity.The simplification exercise, inter-alia, encompasses following aspects:i. Redundant provisions of the Income tax Act have been removed;ii. Sub-sections and clauses have been used, instead of relying on provisos and explanations for exceptions and carve-outs;iii.

The timelines and computation in the Bill are now with reference to the financial year for which the income is liable to be taxed. It is expected that the use of ‘tax year’ will make the new Bill easier to comprehend. Further, many of the comparable tax jurisdictions in the world are using one single term, for purpose of denoting the unit period of taxation. ‘Tax year’ is commonly used in many countries.With the introduction of ‘tax year’, broadly the following principles have been adopted:i. ‘Tax Year’: Unit period of taxation. This term shall be referred in respect of all transactions and income for that period.ii. ‘Financial Year’: For purposes of timelines for compliance and for procedural issues.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan denounced on Friday the reference against it in a joint India-US declaration, calling it “one-sided, misleading, and contrary to diplomatic norms”.The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.“We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms ,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly press briefing.“We are surprised that the reference has been added to the joint statement notwithstanding Pakistan’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US,” Khan said. “Such references cannot cover up India’s sponsorship of terrorism, subversion and extrajudicial assassinations in the region and beyond, nor can they shift international attention from the stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,” the FO spokesperson said.“Pakistan is also deeply concerned over the planned transfer of military technology to India. Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint india-us statement called on islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 mumbai attack and the pathankot attack. “we consider the pakistan-specific reference in the indo-us joint statement on february 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman shafqat ali khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
