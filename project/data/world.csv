NEW DELHI: The last Indian warship to be built abroad, a 3,900-tonne multi-role stealth frigate packed with sensors and weapons like the BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, will be commissioned as INS Tamal in Russia on July 1.The Navy currently has 59 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards at an overall cost of around Rs 1.2 lakh crore to add to its expanding blue-water combat capabilities.It also has the initial approval or ‘acceptance of necessity (AoN)’ for indigenous construction of another 31 warships, including big projects for nine diesel-electric submarines, seven new-generation frigates and eight anti-submarine warfare corvettes.“The force has fully transformed from a `Buyer’s Navy’ to a `Builder’s Navy’ over the years. There is no plan for an Indian warship to be constructed abroad in the future,” a senior officer told TOI.The Navy, which currently has 140 warships and submarines along with over 250 aircraft and helicopters, plans to expand to around 180 warships and 350 aircraft and helicopters by 2030.This is crucial for tackling the rapidly-growing maritime collusiveness between China, which has the world’s largest Navy with 370 warships but is currently constrained by the `tyranny of logistics’ in the Indian Ocean Region, and Pakistan.China is also helping Pakistan to augment its naval capabilities, with the latter on course to induct eight Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines with air-independent propulsion in a major capability jump.The 125-metre long INS Tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief Vice Admiral Sanjay J Singh in Kaliningrad.India in Oct 2018 had inked an umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates, with the first two to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore. The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore.The first frigate, INS Tushil, reached her home port of Karwar from Russia in February. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted from 2003-2004 onwards.Designed for blue-water operations across the spectrum of naval warfare in the four dimensions of air, surface, underwater and electromagnetic, these frigates are armed with a wide array of advanced weapon systems. “INS Tamal has significant upgrades over her predecessors, punching well above her weight,” an officer said.Apart from BrahMos missiles, the frigate has Shtil vertical launched surface-to-air missiles, an improved A190-01 100mm gun and a new age electro-optical/infrared Sandal V system. She is also equipped with a 30mm close-in weapon system, heavyweight torpedoes, urgent attack anti-submarine rockets, apart from various surveillance and fire control radars and systems.“Kamov-31 early-warning and Kamov-28 multirole helicopters can also operate from her deck. The combat capability is augmented by a host of network-centric warfare capabilities, including the latest SATCOM, radio, high-speed data link, and advanced electronic warfare suite,” the officer said.","The 125-metre long ins tamal, with extended endurance, a top speed of over 30 knots and a crew of 250 sailors, will be commissioned at a ceremony presided over by western naval command chief vice admiral sanjay j singh in kaliningrad.

Diplomacy collapses as Trump turns to force





The United States on early Sunday carried out airstrikes on three of Iran’s most critical nuclear sites, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, marking the first direct American intervention in Israel’s ongoing conflict with Tehran. The strike on Fordow, a heavily fortified underground facility, reportedly involved the use of six 30,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs, weapons only deployable by the US Air Force’s B-2 stealth bombers.Trump announced the operation early Sunday, calling it a “very successful military operation” and a “historic moment for the United States, Israel, and the world.” He added: “All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors... NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!”Tehran has issued a fierce response to US airstrikes calling the attacks a ""savage assault"" and vowing its nuclear program will continue uninterrupted. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responded defiantly, stating they will not be intimidated by “the noise made by Trump or criminal gangs ruling the White House and Tel Aviv.” The IRGC accused Washington of placing itself “at the front line of aggression” and warned that the US lacks the “initiative or the ability” to avoid the consequences of what it called a severe response.Labeling US military bases in the region as a “point of vulnerability,” the IRGC added that Iran’s nuclear program, being indigenous and peaceful, cannot be destroyed “by any attack.”Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization described the strikes as a “blatant violation of international law” and criticized the UN’s nuclear watchdog for alleged complicity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the operation as a “pivot of history,” while Trump declared the mission “a spectacular military success.”Trump addressed the nation late Saturday, declaring the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities a “spectacular military success.” In his televised remarks, Trump stated, “Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” emphasizing the mission’s goal to “stop Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity and put a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world’s number one state sponsor of terror. ”He reiterated the objective, saying, “Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror.”Trump praised the coordination between the US and Israel, stating, “We worked as a team, like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we’ve gone a long way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel.” He added, “I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu,” and further acknowledged the role of Israeli forces: “I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they’ve done.”Turning to the broader conflict, Trump warned, “There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days.” He concluded, “Iran, bully of the Middle East, must now make peace.”President Trump made a surprise announcement Saturday, stating that the US had launched a “very successful attack” on three nuclear sites in Iran. He claimed that a “full payload of BOMBS” was dropped on Fordow, the most fortified of Iran’s facilities. Fox News host Sean Hannity later said he had spoken to Trump directly, confirming that six bunker buster bombs were used at Fordow, while 30 Tomahawk missiles hit Natanz and Isfahan. The B-2 stealth bombers used for the mission are the only aircraft capable of carrying the 30,000-lb GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator.Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization has condemned recent attacks on its nuclear facilities in Fordoww, Natanz, and Isfahan, claiming the sites were targeted “by the enemies.” In a statement, the organization said that the attacks violate international law and declared that it will not allow the development of this “national industry” to be stopped. It added that it has begun taking necessary measures, including legal proceedings, to “defend the rights” of Iran. The organization also called on the international community to condemn what it described as “lawlessness based on the law of the jungle” and to support Iran in achieving its legitimate rights.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded in a recorded statement released by his office at 4:41 a.m. local time (0141 GMT), praising US President Donald Trump ’s actions. He said, “Tonight, Trump and the US acted with a lot of strength” and added, “America has been truly unsurpassed.” Netanyahu stated that “history will record that President Trump acted to deny the most dangerous regime, the world’s most dangerous weapons.” He concluded by saying Trump’s leadership has created a pivot of history that can help lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace.The US strikes come after nine days of sustained Israeli bombing raids on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Israeli officials say their campaign severely damaged Iranian air defences and key nuclear sites, opening a narrow opportunity for the US to deliver a decisive strike. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar claimed Iran’s nuclear programme had been set back by two years. Tehran, however, continues to deny it seeks nuclear weapons and insists its programme is for peaceful purposes.The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-lb conventional bomb, is designed to destroy heavily fortified targets buried deep underground. Fordow, for instance, is estimated to be buried 80 to 90 metres beneath the surface. US and Israeli officials say the bunker busters, which drill deeper with each successive blast, offer the best chance of destroying such sites. These bombs can only be deployed by B-2 stealth bombers, which were reportedly seen departing US bases earlier in the week.The three Iranian sites hit Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan are central to its nuclear ambitions. Fordow is deeply buried and recently ramped up uranium enrichment to 60%. Natanz, Iran’s largest enrichment facility, hosts thousands of centrifuges in underground bunkers. Isfahan, a major research centre, includes conversion facilities and three reactors. The International Atomic Energy Agency had earlier confirmed enriched uranium production at all three sites. Tehran acknowledged attacks at all locations, though claimed that the sites had been evacuated “some time ago.”Iranian officials responded with fury to the US strikes. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei warned that American involvement would bring “irreparable damage.” President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not halt its nuclear programme “under any circumstances.” Tehran’s retaliation has already included suicide drone attacks on Israel and warnings from Houthi allies in Yemen to resume Red Sea attacks on US vessels. Iranian officials have promised a “more devastating” response if the strikes continue.The US had pursued a diplomatic track for months, with Trump twice urging Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to delay military action. However, after talks failed to produce results, Trump reversed course. Vice President JD Vance defended the decision, stating, “He is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people’s goals.” The shift from diplomacy to airstrikes marks a return to Trump’s hardline stance, consistent with his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.","The united states on early sunday carried out airstrikes on three of iran’s most critical nuclear sites.

Background to the escalation



Iran's nuclear history







US President Donald Trump announced Saturday evening that the United States has launched precision airstrikes on three of Iran’s most critical nuclear facilities -- Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.""All planes are now outside of Iran air space,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!""The Natanz facility, located around 220 kilometers southeast of Tehran, is the center of Iran’s uranium enrichment efforts. It had already been struck by Israeli airstrikes before the latest round of attacks. According to the UN’s nuclear watchdog, uranium at Natanz had been enriched to 60% purity -- a level close to weapons-grade.Israel destroyed the above-ground parts of the facility, and further damage was reported underground where powerful centrifuges were located. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) believes most of these machines were taken out when the power supply was cut during the attack.The IAEA confirmed that any radioactive contamination stayed within the site and didn’t spread to nearby areas.Iran had also begun building new sections deeper underground, near a nearby mountain called Kūh-e Kolang Gaz Lā (Pickax Mountain), to better shield its operations. Over the years, Natanz has faced multiple attacks, including the infamous Stuxnet virus — a cyberweapon believed to have been created by the US and Israel -- and other airstrikes linked to Israel.Fordow, another enrichment facility, is about 100 kilometers southwest of Tehran. While not as large as Natanz, it is considered much harder to strike because it’s built under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft systems.Iran kept the site secret until 2009, when Western intelligence discovered it and exposed its existence. It houses advanced centrifuges that work together to enrich uranium.Because it is buried so deeply, only highly specialized bombs, like the US-made GBU-57 ""bunker buster,"" can potentially destroy it. These bombs are massive -- weighing around 30,000 pounds -- and can only be dropped by America’s B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, operated solely by the US Air Force. This means any serious attack on Fordow would likely require direct US involvement.The Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center lies about 350 kilometers southeast of Tehran and is known for being Iran’s major nuclear research hub. It employs thousands of scientists and contains three research reactors supplied by China. Alongside the reactors, the site also includes laboratories and a uranium conversion facility, which plays a key role in the early stages of nuclear fuel production.Israel has carried out strikes on parts of the Isfahan site, including the conversion plant. However, the IAEA has confirmed that there has been no increase in radiation levels after the strikes, indicating that the attacks did not cause nuclear leakage.Also read | ' The bully must now make peace': What Donald Trump said after Iran strike; top quotes While Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan were hit, several other parts of Iran’s nuclear program have not been targeted by recent airstrikes. The most notable is the Bushehr nuclear power plant, located along the Persian Gulf, around 750 kilometers south of Tehran. This facility is used for civilian energy and is fueled by uranium from Russia. It remains under IAEA supervision.Another important site is the Arak heavy water reactor, situated southwest of Tehran. Although it has the potential to produce plutonium -- a material used in nuclear weapons -- Iran had agreed to redesign it under the 2015 nuclear deal to reduce international concerns. Lastly, the Tehran Research Reactor, housed within the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran’s headquarters, once required highly enriched uranium. It has since been modified to use low-enriched uranium as a non-proliferation measure.The US airstrikes follow closely on the heels of Israel’s own offensive, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, aimed at disrupting Iran’s nuclear program. Iran responded with retaliatory actions of its own earlier this week.Iran’s nuclear journey began in 1957 with assistance from the US under the Shah’s regime, focused on peaceful energy development. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, relations soured and American support ended. Despite being a signatory to the UN’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -- which prohibits the development of nuclear weapons -- Iran’s intentions have long been a subject of global suspicion.Now, with strikes on its nuclear heartland, the region stands at a dangerous crossroads -- with the possibility of diplomacy or a wider war hanging in the balance.Read | 'Future attacks will be greater if ...': US strikes Iran's nuclear facilities - 10 key developments","Us president donald trump announced saturday evening that the united states has launched precision airstrikes on three of iran’s most critical nuclear facilities.

Poll Should pilots have more stringent regulations regarding flight duty times? Yes, for safety No, current regulations are sufficient

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered the removal of three Air India officials who are incharge of crew rostering following “lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements”. AI has been warned that “any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable” — basically the regulator has warned going to the extent of shutting down AI if lapses on this crucial front continue.In response to the order, Air India said: ""We acknowledge the regulator’s directive and have implemented the order. In the interim, the company's Chief Operations Officer will provide direct oversight to the Integrated Operations Control Centre (IOCC). Air India is committed to ensuring that there is total adherence to safety protocols and standard practices.""The DGCA has also issued a showcase to the airline for operating two flights — Bangalore-London on May 16 & 17 — by making pilots fly for longer than the 10 hours that was allowed as per flight duty time limitation (FDTL) dispensation given to AI at that point of time.The June 20 order on the three official says: “Repeated and serious violations voluntarily disclosed by Air India concerning flight crew being scheduled and operated despite lapses in licensing, rest, and recency requirements. These violations were discovered during review (in crew rostering platform transition). The voluntary disclosures, while noted, point to systemic failures in crew scheduling, compliance monitoring, and internal accountability. Of particular concern is the absence of strict disciplinary measures against key officials directly responsible for these operational lapses.”The order says the three identified senior officials “have been involved in serious and repeated lapses including but not limited to: Unauthorised and non-compliant crew pairings; Violation of mandatory licensing and recency norms; Systemic failures in scheduling protocol and oversight.”The regulator has directed AI to “remove (these three) from all roles and responsibilities related to crew scheduling and rostering. Internal disciplinary proceedings must be initiated against these officials without delay, and the outcome of such proceedings shall be reported to this office within 10 days from the date of issue of this letter. The (three) officials shall be reassigned to non-operational roles pending conclusion of corrective reforms in scheduling practices, and shall not hold any position involving direct influence over flight safety and crew compliance until further notice. Any future violation of crew scheduling norms, licensing, or flight time limitations detected in any post-audit or inspection, will attract strict enforcement action, including but not limited to penalties, license suspension, or withdrawal of operator permissions as applicable.”Apart from this order, the DGCA on June 20 also issued a showcase to AI for violating FDTL norms for pilots of two Bangalore-London flights on May 16 and 17. “Accountable manager has failed to ensure adherence,” the notice while seeking a response within seven days.Comments have been sought from AI on both these issues and are awaited.","The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has ordered the removal of three air india officials who are incharge of crew rostering.

For the last 2-3 days, the entire Congress party kept saying that Pakistan's army chief general Asim Munir is going to the US.This was a trap by Pakistan,” Dubey told ANI.“People across the country turned the opposition to Modi into opposition to the country. Today, it is known that the White House or the US military never called Asim Munir. What is the difference between the Pakistan Muslim League and Jairam Ramesh?”Taking a deeper historical swipe, Dubey cited the 1985 Kanishka bombing by Khalistani extremists, alleging Canada’s inaction at the time was symptomatic of how Indira Gandhi’s diplomatic efforts were often ignored.“When the Kanishka bomb blast happened in 1985, Canada began its investigation only in 2006. Former Canadian PM Pierre Trudeau, who was in power from 1968 to 1984, received seven letters from Indira Gandhi over 16 years, asking him to act against Khalistani terrorists,” Dubey said.“He never responded. He never listened.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Saturday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, questioning the success of the 'Make in India’ initiative and accused him of focusing on catchy slogans rather than delivering real solutions to India's economic challenges.In a post on X, Gandhi said, ""’Make in India’ promised a factory boom. So why is manufacturing at record lows, youth unemployment at record highs, and why have imports from China more than doubled? Modi ji has mastered the art of slogans, not solutions. Since 2014, manufacturing has fallen to 14% of our economy.""He highlighted that manufacturing has dropped to just 14% of the country’s economy since 2014, the year the initiative was launched. He also pointed to a sharp rise in imports from China, accusing the Union government of ignoring local industry in favour of catchy slogans.Gandhi, LoP in Lok Sabha, also shared a video of his interaction with two young men, Shivam and Saif, in Nehru Place, New Delhi. He said the duo are skilled and full of potential but lack the opportunities to succeed in today’s economic environment.“The truth is stark: we assemble, we import, but we don't build.China profits."" he said, criticising India's dependence on imported goods and lack of robust manufacturing.He further alleged that the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, once heavily promoted by the government, is now being quietly rolled back.""With no new ideas, Modi ji has surrendered. Even the much-hyped PLI scheme is now being quietly rolled back. India needs a fundamental shift - one that empowers lakhs of producers through honest reforms and financial support,” Gandhi warned.“We must stop being a market for others. If we don't build here, we'll keep buying from those who do. The clock is ticking, ” he added.The Make in India initiative was launched by PM Modi in 2014 as part of a broader effort to drive nation-building and boost the manufacturing sector.","Congress mp rahul gandhi took a jibe at prime minister narendra modi.

It must be an embarrassment to any country that the military chief gets invited and the prime minister is nowhere to be seen,” Singh said.“It’s a very strange thing... It’s a weird, structurally imbalanced state where the military essentially has first claim on resources.”His remarks come amid growing global scrutiny of Pakistan's internal power dynamics and its military’s central role in foreign policy.On India’s recently concluded Operation Sindoor , Singh revealed that the Pakistani military faced “manifold” losses in terms of both men and material compared to India.“In terms of both assets, material and casualties, the losses on their side are manifold, anything that we have suffered,” he said.Singh also commented on speculation about Chinese support to Pakistan during the operation. While ruling out direct involvement, he hinted at indirect assistance.“Collusion in terms of equipment, supplies, helping them out in various ways, perhaps with satellite imagery as well — all that could have happened, but definitely they did not take any active role,” Singh said.“Trust is low… Pakistanis don't have many resources, so they will do all this begging, borrowing, etc., to get equipment from wherever they can, whether it is Turkey or China.

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Saturday renewed his attack on the Election Commission, questioning its transparency and alleging a deliberate attempt to destroy crucial poll-related data. The poll body reacted saying that making webcasting footage of polling stations public violated privacy and security concerns of voters.""Voter list? Will not provide machine-readable format. CCTV footage? It was hidden by changing the law. Photo-video of the election? Now, not in 1 year, we will destroy it in 45 days only. The one from whom the answer was needed - is destroying the evidence. It is clear - the match is fixed. And a fixed election is poison for democracy,"" read a post by Rahul Gandhi on X.EC officials argued that while such demands appeared to champion voter interest and democratic integrity, they were actually intended to achieve the ""opposite objective"".What is presented as a reasonable and logical request directly contradicts voter privacy, legal provisions under the Representation of the People Acts of 1950 and 1951, and Supreme Court directives, PTI reported citing EC officials.Officials warned that sharing the footage could allow easy identification of voters and non-voters, exposing them to potential pressure, discrimination, or intimidation by anti-social elements. Citing a possible scenario, officials further said that if a political party received fewer votes at a specific booth, it could use CCTV footage to identify who voted and who didn’t—potentially leading to targeted harassment or intimidation of those individuals.They clarified that the Election Commission retained CCTV footage, used solely as an internal administrative tool, for 45 days in line with the legal window for filing an election petition. Since no election can be challenged beyond this period, they argued that keeping the footage any longer could lead to its misuse by non-contestants to spread misinformation or malicious narratives. They added that if an election petition is filed within 45 days, the footage is preserved and made available to the competent court upon request.The government, last year, amended election rules, based on the EC's recommendation, to restrict public access to certain electronic records—such as CCTV and webcast footage—to prevent misuse. In a May 30 letter, the EC informed state officials that multiple recording methods, including photography, videography, CCTV, and webcasting, are used to document the election process.","Leader of opposition in the lok sabha, rahul gandhi, renewed his attack on the election commission.

One of the Pahalgam attackers was former Pak para commando

NEW DELHI: Three attackers - all Pakistani terrorists affiliated to Lashkar-e-Taiba - executed the brutal killing of 26 men, including 25 tourists, in Pahalgam on April 22, as per disclosures by two Kashmiris arrested by National Investigation Agency Sunday for harbouring the three terrorists prior to the attack.The arrests of Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar from Batkote, Pahalgam, and Bashir Ahmad Jothar of Hill Park, Pahalgam, mark a big breakthrough in the case that shook the nation. The attack, the origins of which were traced to masterminds based in Pakistan, had led to retaliatory strikes by India on terror facilities and later even military assets inside Pakistan.The two arrested men — accused of having knowingly provided shelter to the three attackers at a seasonal ‘dhok’ (hut) in Hill Park, besides food and logistical support, before the terror act — have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack, confirming that they were Pakistani nationals affiliated to the proscribed terrorist outfit LeT.TOI has learnt that one of the attackers is confirmed to be Hashim Musa alias Sulaiman, purportedly a former para commando of Pakistan army’s special forces, the Special Service Group (SSG). As reported by TOI on April 29, Musa was active in Kashmir for a few months before the Pahalgam massacre and was part of the twin strikes in Oct 2024 at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which six non-locals and a local doctor were killed, and Buta Pathri, which had left two Army personnel and two porters dead.Musa was possibly loaned by SSG to the LeT, which had sent him on a specific mission to unleash terror attacks on non-locals and security forces, as per sources.Apart from Musa, J&K police had put out sketches of another Pakistani terrorist, Ali Bhai, and a local terrorist, Adil Hussain Thoker, who had received terror training in Pakistan — all identified on the basis of eyewitness statements. It had declared a Rs 20-lakh award for any information on them.NIA sources told TOI that the agency zeroed in on Parvaiz and Bashir based on statements of witnesses, including around 15 overground workers found to be in touch with the attackers or who had partial knowledge of the conspiracy, as well as “technical analysis”. Technical surveillance found that the attackers were in touch with Pakistan-based Lashkar masterminds via Chinese apps such as Ultra. They are still suspected to be hiding in the jungles dotting the Tral-Kulgam-Anantnag tri-junction.The two arrested accused will be produced in an NIA court in Jammu. Their custodial interrogation is expected to give important clues about the Pahalgam attack conspiracy and its origins in Pakistan.Sources told TOI that the two accused do not have a police record. NIA has arrested the duo under Section 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.",Arrests of two kashmiris mark a big breakthrough in the case that shook the nation.

Blake Lively devastated as Taylor Swift cuts all ties

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm, Taylor Swift isn’t alone. Travis Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.

U.S.' B-2 Bombers Air-drop GBU-57 Bombs On Iran's Nuclear Facilities | Trump's Shock Announcement

Details of 'Operation Midnight Hammer'



At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprising bombers launched from the continental United States as part of a plan to maintain the tactical surprise of the package, the Pentagon said. Part of the package proceeded to the West and proceeded to the Pacific as decoy. This decoy operation was only known to an extremely small number of planners and key leaders in Washington. The main strike package comprised seven B-2 bombers, each with two crew members. This package proceeded quietly to the east with minimal communication. Through the 18-hour flight into the target area, the aircraft (main package) completed multiple in-flight refuelings. Once over the land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly timed manoeuvre, requiring exact synchronisation across multiple platforms in a narrow piece of airspace -- all done with minimal communication. The Pentagon said that this type of integration is what US Joint Force is known for in the world. At 5pm (EST), just before the strike package entered Iran, a US submarine in the Central Command area of responsibility launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure targets at Isfahan. When the strike package entered the Iranian airspace, the US employed several deception tactics, including decoys as the 4th- and 5th-Generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package in high altitude and high speed, sweeping in front of the package. Then the strike package approached Fordow and Natanz, the US protection package employed high-speed suppression weapons to ensure safe passage of the strike package with fighter assets employing pre-emptive suppressing fires against any potential Iranian surface-to-air threats. Pentagon said it is not aware of any shots fired at the US strike package on the way in. At 6.40 pm (EST), the lead B-2 bombers dropped two GBU-57 on the first of several aimpoints at Fordow. All three Iranian infrastructure targets were struck between 6.40 PM and 7.05 PM (EST). The Tomahawk missiles were the last to strike at Isfahan, as the Pentagon described them as the surprise element of the attack. After the weapon release, the Midnight Hammer Strike package exited Iranian airspace and began returning home. Pentagon said it was not aware of any shots fired at them during the exit.





The operation that US launched on Iran after President Donald Trump ditched his two-week deadline was named Operation Midnight Hammer, the Pentagon announced Sunday revealing the details of the deliberate and precision attack against three Iranian nuclear facilities. It was a complex and high-risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline by the joint force. The operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapon infrastructure; it was planned and executed across multiple domains and theatres with coordination that reflects US ability to project power globally, the Pentagon said at a briefing.Operation Midnight Hammer was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington with knowledge about it -- its timing or nature, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said.",U.s. b-2 bombers air-drop gbu-57 bombs on iran's nuclear facilities. Operation was designed to severely degrade iran's nuclear weapon infrastructure.

It has a range of over 6,000 nautical miles without refuelling, enabling strike capabilities from US continental bases. On the other hand, with aerial refuelling, it can reach virtually any target worldwide.A 2-pilot aircraft, the B-2 has a payload capacity of more than 40,000 pounds, and can thus carry a diverse array of both conventional and nuclear weapons. It is also equipped with large ordnance loads, which could include two GBU-57A/B MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), and a 30,000-pound precision-guided ""bunker buster"" bomb.The MOP is the largest conventional bomb in the US arsenal, specifically engineered to defeat hardened underground bunkers.Read |' The bully must now make peace': What Donald Trump said after Iran strike; top quotes","The united states formally entered the israel-iran conflict, as it bombed three nuclear facilities in iran early sunday morning local time.
