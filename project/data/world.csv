■ Strategic autonomy is the core principle of French diplomacy and it is also the case with India. We have the same view on the Indo-Pacific. My president has always been very clear. We oppose any kind of hegemon in the region.We realise that thanks to this strategic partnership, which celebrated its 25th anniversary two years ago, our common interest is really to work hand in hand in different sectors. That’s why we adopted a new roadmap when PM Modi visited France.Defence and security really is the core of our partnership. We just had good news about the Rafale (M) aircraft. In the coming months and years, you will see more... Make in India is a priority for India and all our big stakeholders in the defence industry want to play the game. That means coming to India, building in India and transfer of technology. That’s the key.What we have done through a new roadmap is to enlarge the relationship. We have three pillars. The first is defence and security. The second is what we call the partnership for the planet... issues like climate change and biodiversity protection. The third pillar is, for me, maybe the most challenging because it’s the key to long-term (ties): people-topeople exchanges. Indian diaspora in France is quite small compared to your diaspora in other countries. And one of the consequences is that the number of students in France is also very small.■ Our president gave us a very ambitious target, to very rapidly have 30,000 Indian students (8,000 registered for 20232024, 10,000 threshold expected to be achieved this year). We have created a mechanism for international classes and signed agreements with 35 universities. And in those universities, we have specific classes only for Indians ( classes internationales ).We haven’t done this for other countries. So, we take Indian students at the end of high school, send them to those classes for one year (where) they will have intensive French learning and, at the same time, start courses for the curriculum they would like to follow. It means that after one year, there is no language problem.French business schools now are among the best in the world. What is very interesting is that since last year Indian students are the top foreign nationality in our business school. For the simple reason that in these schools the curriculum is totally in English. It suggests that Indian students find France attractive. We have a different approach to student mobility. Our intention is not to attract hundreds of thousands of students. We want to attract the best. And we want those students to come back to India because we want our university partnership and student mobility to be part of our strategic partnership.We have about 800 French companies in the country. They are already employing more than 500,000 Indians. So, we tell our Indian students, well, try to learn French but, if not, you go to France anyway to study and after you graduate, you come back to your country because your country needs you and you can help us develop this strategic partnership. We don’t want to facilitate any brain drain.■ Well, I think the new American administration has brought to the international scene more volatility and unpredictability. I would say that more than ever the strategic partnership between France and India is the key. Stability is important. And it’s not a question only for govts, it’s also essential for the private sector. I see an advantage in this new situation... which is that once again partnerships like the one we have with India are going to be very important. We just had a historic visit by the European Commission president during which it was announced that the India-EU FTA will be finalised by the end of this year.■ My answer to that is simple. When it comes to transfer of technology, or rehabilitation of the industrial sector, you won’t be able to find a better offer than that from the French. Judge us from the past and from the present. And what you have seen so far is just the beginning of a long journey. Our Indian partners trust us. They know that our industry is here to stay, to invest, as I said, to produce, to make in India,to do transfer of technology. I’m not sure that other stakeholders would be ready to do the same.■ In Europe, we have rules not to put barriers in our market. As a matter of fact, the European market is the most open in the world.It means huge opportunities for Indian companies. But, at the same time, we have rules which are there for everybody. Like for our own companies… protecting the environment, for example. It’s well known that we have a strong interest in the agri business, in exporting wines, champagne.... For Germany, it will be the automotive sector. India has its own interests. We have to sit around the table and look at all the parameters. I am confident that now there is political will on both sides for that.■ You have to understand there is one aggressor, Russia, and one country that has been invaded — Ukraine. An offer of peace has been put on the table and the US contributed to it. And Ukraine is eager for peace but not Russia.In order to have peace, everybody has to come to the table, including Russia. But that’s not the case. Most EU countries now realise they need to take their future into their own hands as far as security and defence is concerned. I’m sure that in a couple of years, when peace is back in Ukraine, you will see a totally different Europe. Our dream, to some extent, would be to have this strategic autonomy at the European level, which is obviously not the case so far.■ The need for unity and autonomy is clearly shared by all EU members. Ukraine was a real trigger for all of us to understand that we shouldn’t rely on outsiders. Look at Germany. The decisions they have taken are historic. Like the next chancellor’s decision to invest massively in defence. The way Europe sees itself is changing. But obviously it will take some time.■ Having a strategic partnership and very close relations with India means that we talk of everything. On the French journalist issue, a solution was found. Both countries trust each other and that is the core of the relationship.■ When you want to go to France as a tourist, we do our best at the Embassy of France in India to process the visa application in 48 hours after we receive the file. As France is part of Schengen zone, we are also bound by Schengen rules. We really want to welcome more Indian tourists, students, professionals.■ Well, I think it’s essential for these two big giants in the world and in Asia to find a way to fully normalise their relations. What I said about India being a key for finding solutions to challenges like global health, climate change is true also for China. At some point, the two countries will have to find a way to not just resolve the border issue but also find ways to address the big challenges that the world is facing. The 20th century to some extent or the 19th century was the West’s century. Now, all eyes are on Asia. And you have two big players — India and China. We naturally wish they can have normal relations.","French ambassador to india thierry mathou tells toi how his country is looking to widen bilateral ties, expand trade, attract more students and tourists.

NEW DELHI: From naming ' Operation Sindoor ' to deploying women officers to present India's perspective to the world and dedicating the success of the Indian armed forces in destroying terror hubs in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has kept women at the centre of India's retaliation against the hostile neighbour.Calling the Pahalgam terror attack a personal tragedy, PM Modi on Monday had dedicated the bravery and courage of the armed forces involved in 'Operation Sindoor' to every mother, sister and daughter of the nation.PM Modi said the barbarity displayed by terrorists in Pahalgam had shocked the entire country and the world.Stating that more than 100 dreaded terrorists were killed in the strikes by India, PM Modi said not only were the buildings of terrorist organisations destroyed, but their courage was also badly shaken. ""The terrorists had wiped out the sindoor of our sisters, and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters,"" he said.Sindoor, or vermilion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. The word derives from the Sanskrit word Sindura, referring to red, orange-red or maroon cosmetic powder worn by married Hindu women in the parting of their hair. Sources said naming the operation after vermilion was suggested by PM himself, who wanted a strong message to be sent to the terrorists about the consequences of hurting Indian women.Since the operation was launched, several parents have named their newborn baby girls 'Sindoor' in many parts of the country, with such reports emerging from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Also read: 17 newborns named ‘Sindoor’ in UP’s Kushinagar Details of the retaliatory attacks on Pakistan were given to the world by two women officers - Col Sofia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.

Stop supporting terror or face annihilation: PM Modi to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stop-supporting-terror-or-face-annihilation-pm-modi-to-pakistan/articleshow/121148021.cms,"'No corner in Pak where terrorists can breathe easy': PM

JALANDHAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday sharpened India's new anti-terror doctrine, saying Pakistan had the choice of stopping support to its terror proxies or facing annihilation.Referring to the serious damage caused to Pakistan's crucial air bases, the PM said, ""Patrons of terrorism must have got it now that harbouring evil designs against India can have only one consequence: their annihilation. Killing of innocent Indians can have only one consequence: ruination and complete ruination.""Also read: PM Modi's address at Adampur airbase top quotes: 'Not just terrorists camps, but Pakistan’s audacity was destroyed' Addressing IAF, Army and BSF personnel at Adampur airbase, one of the important installations targeted by Pakistan but which escaped lasting damage, PM Modi also said India would consider a Pakistani regime that backs terror a legitimate target for military retaliation. He reiterated that Operation Sindoor was only paused and India would respond strongly to any terror attack or military misadventure.Speaking against the backdrop of alleged concern in global capitals over a possible escalation and purported offers to mediate, PM Modi reiterated that Operation Sindoor had only been paused and that India would respond strongly to a terror attack or a military misadventure by deciding the manner of retaliation.He said India's successful strikes against Pakistan had shattered the assumption that terror groups could hit India with impunity since they worked under the security umbrella of Pakistan army. ""By routing the Pakistan army, our Army, IAF, Navy... there is no corner in Pakistan where terrorists can breathe easy. We will hit them in their home and will leave no room for them to survive,"" he added.""India's Lakshman Rekha against terror is now unambiguously clear: If there is a terror attack again, India will respond, it will respond for sure. We saw it at the time of surgical strikes (2016) and air strikes (2019). And now, Operation Sindoor is the 'new normal'. We have now decided three things. First, India will retaliate against any terror attack and it will unilaterally determine the manner of its response and its timing. Second, India will not succumb to nuclear blackmail. Third, we will not differentiate between heads of terror groups and a govt that patronises them,"" said the PM who once again stressed that his govt's policy to retaliate militarily against terrorism and military misadventure was not in conflict with the ""this is not the time for war"" stance he had articulated to appeal for cessation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine.""India is not only the land of Buddha, it is also the land of Guru Gobind Singh who called for befitting reply to be given to adversaries. Even our scriptures have sanctioned the use of force against evil,"" the PM said as he referred to the killing of innocent tourists in front their wives in Pahalgam.Significantly, he stressed that the world has gradually been coming to terms with India's 'new normal' towards terror. The choice of Adampur airbase, close to the border which Pakistan targeted with drones and missiles on the night of May 9, was itself a statement. Batteries of S-400 Triumf surface-to-air defence system formed a defiant backdrop, belying Pakistan's claim of having destroyed them. PM Modi landing at the airbase also marked a refutation of Pakistan's claim of having damaged the runway, besides drawing a sharp contrast with the heavily damaged airbases of the hostile neighbour.Also read: Response to Pahalgam terror attack marks new normal in India-Pakistan ties In his speech , the PM kept his steadfast focus on the valour and bravery of the armed forces, and saluted them for calling Pakistan's nuclear bluff.

NEW DELHI: Speaking in Riyadh during his Middle East tour, US President Donald Trump once again claimed the credit for brokering what he called a “historic ceasefire” between India and Pakistan, following days of heightened military tensions earlier this month.“Just days ago, my administration successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between India and Pakistan, and I used trade to a large extent to do it,” Trump said, addressing a crowd.He added, “I said, fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles. Let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully.”Trump praised the leaders of both India and Pakistan, calling them “powerful, strong, smart,” and expressed hope that the ceasefire would hold. He also suggested that US diplomacy may even lead to a potential thaw between the two countries.Trump specifically thanked Senator Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance for their role in the negotiations. “Marco, stand up. What a great job you did on that,” he said.“Maybe we can even get them together a little bit, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he suggested.“Millions of people could have died from that conflict that started off small and was getting bigger and bigger by the day,” Trump said.Later, White House deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott echoed Trump' claims during a press briefing saying, “We welcome the ceasefire between India and Pakistan and commend Prime Ministers Modi and Sharif for choosing the path of peace. As President Trump said, their decision reflects strength, wisdom, and fortitude. We urge both sides to maintain direct communication to preserve regional stability.”The comments come days after India launched Operation Sindoor in response to a terror attack in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday appealed to the opposition parties to rise above political divisions and support the Narendra Modi-led government’s efforts to explore peaceful means of engagement, particularly in the wake of a recent ceasefire initiative.In a detailed post on X, the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said, “The Modi government should not be politically penalised for exploring peaceful means. This is a time for bipartisan statesmanship, not division. The opposition must rise above politics and support genuine efforts for peace and stability.”Calling for a national consensus, Mufti added, “I appeal all the opposition parties to resist the urge for knee-jerk criticism or political point-scoring. Just as the Pahalgam incident united voices from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, there is need to build a national consensus around a peace process that safeguards national interests.”She pointed to examples from the past, noting that, “Leaders like former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh proved that cross-border engagement is possible even in tense times, without compromising security or sovereignty.”In a strong critique of television news channels, Mufti said, “Those who criticise the ceasefire from the comfort of air-conditioned studios and drawing rooms should spend time with their families on the borders to truly understand the daily reality of death and destruction.”In an earlier post on the platform, Mufti also accused the media of distracting the public from real issues, saying, “While fanatic mobs in our country are vandalising shops, bulldozing mosques and digging up graves to punish the long dead Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, across the border his namesake Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed is training his forces for modern air warfare.”She concluded with a warning about media-fuelled narratives, “High time that India wakes up to the toxic narratives being amplified by television channels that have dangerously distracted the country from its real challenges and priorities.”","Mehbooba mufti appeals to opposition parties to support the narendra modi-led government’s efforts to explore peaceful means of engagement.

It lies close to Pakistan's border with Rajasthan in India.The IAF strike created a large crater in the runway, resulting in all flight operations being made non-operational for one week.Besides Rahim Yar Khan, the IAF also decimated PAF airbases Nur Khan, Sukkur, Murid, Shahbaz, Mushaf, Rafiqui and Bholari. Its retaliatory action came after Pakistan launched missiles on Indian military installations in response to Operation Sindoor. However, India's air defence system successfully intercepted the missiles.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited IAF's second-largest airbase, Adampur in Punjab, and busted Pakistan's claim to have destroyed the airbase.Under Operation Sindoor, Indian armed forces launched precision strikes on nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7. More than 100 terrorists were killed in the operation.The strikes were India's response to the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, where Pakistan-backed terrorists shot dead 26 male tourists on April 22.","Rahim yar khan is a forward operating base of the paf’s central command.

What is S400 air defence system?



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday debunked Pakistan's claim of destroying India's S-400 air defence system by posing in front of it during his visit to Adampur airbase in Punjab.This comes after Pakistan's air force (PAF) claimed that its hypersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 system in Adampur. The PAF also shared fake videos and operationalised its disinformation campaign.Earlier in the day, PM Modi visited Adampur airbase, where he interacted with the air force warriors, days after India launched Operation Sindoor. The airbase, which was one of the active airbases during Operation Sindoor, was the key military location that the Pakistani military attempted to attack last week on Wednesday after India launched Operation Sindoor, according to the defence ministry, reported PTI.Later, PM Modi called the meeting with jawans a ""special experience"" and said that India is eternally grateful to the armed forces for everything they do for the nation.""Earlier this morning, I went to AFS Adampur and met our brave air warriors and soldiers. It was a very special experience to be with those who epitomise courage, determination and fearlessness. India is eternally grateful to our armed forces for everything they do for our nation,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.Before PM Modi's visit, the ministry of external affairs had exposed the ""misinformation campaign"" run by Pakistan with several false claims, including that it inflicted damage to the S-400 and BrahMos missile.In a press briefing, Colonel Sofiya Qureshi said, ""Pakistan claimed that it damaged our S-400 and BrahMos missile base with its JF-17, which is completely wrong. Secondly, it also ran a misinformation campaign that our airfields in Sirsa, Jammu, Pathankot, Bathinda, Naliya and Bhuj were damaged, and this misinformation is also completely wrong.""This comes days after India and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire following a sharp escalation in cross-border tensions triggered by the deadly April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam.Pakistan responded with drone attacks targeting areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. These attacks were intercepted by Indian defence systems but raised fears of a broader conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" is an Indian name given to the S-400 Triumf air defence missile system acquired from Russia.The term ""Sudarshan Chakra"" draws from the epic Mahabharata, symbolising precision, speed, and lethal capability—qualities that closely reflect the S-400's operational strengths.Developed by Russia's Almaz-Antey, the S-400 is among the most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile systems in the world. India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 to procure five S-400 units, with the first system deployed in Punjab in 2021 to bolster defences against threats from Pakistan and China. The S-400 can engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 400 km and detect threats as far as 600 km away.It supports four different types of missiles, enabling it to target everything from aircraft and drones to cruise and ballistic missiles. Equipped with sophisticated phased-array radar, the system can track over 100 targets simultaneously and is mounted on mobile launchers for rapid repositioning.The deployment of the S-400 significantly strengthens India’s multi-layered air defence capabilities, offering a strategic edge in protecting key military and civilian assets.

NEW DELHI: In a joint press briefing, senior officers from the Indian Army , Navy, and Air Force presented key findings and operational highlights of Operation Sindoor , which countered recent Pakistani military action.The briefing was led by DG Air Operations Air Marshal AK Bharti and DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai.Air Marshal Bharti revealed that Pakistan used advanced weaponry, including the PL-15 air-to-air missile , of Chinese origin, which failed to hit its target. “You can see the pieces of it on the screen,” he said, showing debris recovered by Indian forces.He also showcased wreckage of long-range rockets, loiter munitions, and unmanned aerial systems, including Turkish-origin YIHA and Songar drones, which were brought down by India's air defence systems.“Our battle-proven systems stood the test of time,” Bharti said, highlighting the performance of the indigenous Akash air defence system and the effectiveness of India’s counter-UAS technologies. He credited sustained government investment and policy support over the last decade for India's advanced capabilities.Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai struck a confident tone, warning against targeting Indian infrastructure. “Targeting our airfields and logistics is way too tough,” he said.

Excerpts:

We've been following you here in India, and you virtually declared that India had a clear-cut victory in the skies. Could you elaborate... why you think India had an advantage, and where did Pakistan fail?

India has so far given no confirmation on striking any nuclear storage sites. In fact, at a press conference by the defence forces, they even jokingly said they didn't know where these existed.

Do you believe the radioactivity reports that have surfaced today?

It's relatively simple in military terms ... Pakistan attempted to hit back at India with UAVs, with artillery missiles, even with ballistic missiles... this effort failed because Indian air defences shot down the mass of incoming weaponry. On the other hand we have seen early on May 10 the IAF striking not only PAF bases but also the entrance, both entrances, to the Pakistan nuclear weapons storage site at Mushaf air base... And the fact is, in the way the military understands warfare, when you start targeting enemy nuclear weapon storage sites, it means you are absolutely sure the enemy cannot hit back... And from this point of view, it's a clear-cut victory for India.There is a video clearly showing hits on entrances, on both entrances of the nuclear storage site, which means it has been geo-confirmed... of course, Pakistanis, a few I have spoken to, they have said, 'No.' But I have a strong feeling ... that India is not shooting missiles wildly around the place where their (Pakistani) nuclear weapons are stored. So, the overall conclusion is that New Delhi does not want to further escalate. And once you keep in mind, Indian generals in particular ... they are stolidly conservative ... they wouldn't let anybody randomly shoot missiles in that direction. This is a clear message. We can hit you where it hurts. The conclusion is unavoidable. Pakistan cannot protect its own nuclear weapon storage sites, cannot even protect its air bases. Therefore, India is in a position of clear advantage...I haven't studied them closely yet... But the point is this: whatever the radioactivity explains, the fact is that the nuclear storage site has been hit, not directly the storage site, but the entrance into the underground complex. It means that most likely the entrance and exit to this storage site have been cut off ... If the Pakistanis cannot enter the storage site, if they cannot reach their nuclear weapons ... it's game over.","Austrian aerial warfare analyst and military historian tom cooper tells times now’s navika kumar that the videos are evidence that india has struck and destroyed the entrances to nuclear sites in pakistan.

NEW DELHI: India slammed Pakistan again on Tuesday for supporting cross-border terrorism , saying a nation which had nurtured terrorism on an industrial scale thinking that it could escape the consequences was fooling itself. Government was responding to a statement by the Pakistan foreign ministry which described PM Narendra Modi's address to the nation as ""inflammatory"".""The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.Government also denied that there has been any India-Pakistan hyphenation, going by the statements coming out of the US. On the contrary, government said, there was widespread understanding in the world that Indian tourists were the victims of terrorism in Pahalgam and that the epicentre of terrorism was across the border in Pakistan. ""A number of foreign leaders, in their conversations with Indian counterparts, recognised India's right to defend itself and protect its people,"" Jaiswal said, recalling the UNSC condemnation of the reprehensible act of terrorism.He also said India would continue to pursue the UN listing of The Resistance Front, an LeT proxy which claimed responsibility for Pahalgam, as a terror group. As foreign secretary Vikram Misri said last week, India has already provided information to the 1267 sanctions committee for its listing and will soon share more details with the monitoring team.While Pakistan has said the ceasefire will collapse if the Indus Waters Treaty issue is not resolved, govt stressed that India will keep the treaty in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism.On Pakistani claims of having inflicted heavy damage upon Indian military facilities, govt said satellite pictures were available commercially and it was possible to look at the sites which Pakistan claims to have attacked. ""Contrast it with the places which we successfully targeted and destroyed. That will give you a clear picture,"" Jaiswal said.On who first sought an end to the fighting, the official said one has to look only at who called who to negotiate the terms of cessation of firing. ""Till the night of May 9, Pakistan was threatening India with a massive assault. Once their attempt failed on May 10 morning and they received a devastating Indian counter-response, their tune changed,"" he added.","Government also denied that there has been any india-pakistan hyphenation.

India's AKASH Defence System Outfoxes Pakistan, Nips Drone Attacks In The Bud | 'My Baby Worked'

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triumf when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.","Akash missile system key in repelling pakistani drone attacks along loc, said officials.

Gender integration in defence services calibrated to operational needs: Government

NEW DELHI: The Centre has told Supreme Court that men and women are recruited to the Judge Advocate General (JAG or legal) department in the Army through separate service selection boards (SSBs) because women officers are not readied for combat roles, while the men get mandatorily attached to artillery units as part of induction.A woman had challenged separate SSBs and merit lists for male and female officers recruited to the department. The apex court had reserved its verdict on the plea and asked the Centre to file its submissions.Govt said operational readiness determines vacancies in Army, and as a policy, women officers aren't meant for frontline combat deployment where contact with enemies is likely. They aren't deployed for counter-insurgency or counter-terror forces, such as Rashtriya Rifles & Assam Rifles, it cited.Countering the petitioner's argument before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan that JAG officers do not have combat roles, the Centre said not only do the male officers get attached to artillery units but are also expected to discharge the role of combatants in case of armed conflicts. It cited their deployment in Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka and Kargil operations.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said on behalf of the Centre, ""Due to the prevailing operational scenario, Indian Army has a standing operational deployment unlike modern western armies. India is surrounded by states inimical to our interests along the immediate neighbourhood. This implies that our Army is mandated to maintain operational readiness to undertake conventional operations along northern and Western borders.""Without referring to Operation Sindoor , govt said, ""No one can predict when the next conflict arises, in which or both borders, at what force level, and whether as a full-scale war or limited operations. Depending on the operational need and force strength, combatant personnel deployed in peacetime duties get mobilised irrespective of their arm/service to boost the operational necessities of the regular Army.""Arguing against judicial interference based on gender parity without considering its impact on operational readiness of armed forces , the Centre said, ""Gender integration in the defence services is an evolving process and is calibrated to the operational needs and is subjected to periodic review and studies.
