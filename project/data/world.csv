Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India responsible?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

Poll What do you think is the most significant advantage of the BrahMos missile system? Extended strike range and precision Faster deployment and versatility

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km brahmos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

""Being close to you, feeling your breath, sensing your heartbeat, and seeing the sparkle in your eyes, I realised something profound. I slept a little early yesterday, which I normally don’t do. The reason I slept early was that after observing you all day, the sense of fulfilment I felt inside was not my own sleep, but the sleep of contentment""

""It is my privilege to celebrate this sacred festival of Diwali among all you brave warriors of the Indian Navy. The night I spent yesterday on INS Vikrant is beyond words to describe.I saw the enthusiasm and joy on your faces. The way you portrayed Operation Sindoor through your songs was truly moving.""

So that I too can celebrate Diwali with my own.And that is what makes this Diwali truly special for me.""

""The Indian Navy is like the guardian of the Indian Ocean.""

""I was observing the strength of the military equipment. These large ships, aircraft that move faster than the wind, these submarines, they are impressive in themselves, but what makes them truly formidable is the courage of those who operate them. These ships may be made of iron, but when you board them, they become living, breathing forces of the armed services. I have been with you since yesterday. In every moment, I have learned something. When I left Delhi, I thought I would live this moment myself. But your hard work, penance and dedication are on such a high level that I could not truly live it. I did, however, gain an understanding of it. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to truly live this life.""

""Just a few months ago, we witnessed how the very name Vikrant sent waves of fear across Pakistan.Such is its might — a name that shatters the enemy’s courage even before the battle begins. This is the power of INS Vikrant.""

""The fear generated by the Indian Navy, the extraordinary skill displayed by the Indian Air Force , the bravery of the Indian Army, and the tremendous coordination among the three forces compelled Pakistan to surrender so quickly during Operation Sindoor.

It's a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon,"" he added.Responding to ANI's question whether he views India as a reliable partner, Trump said: ""Yeah, sure. He's (PM Narendra Modi) a friend of mine. We have a great relationship.. I was not happy that India was buying oil. And he assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia.

India’s overall crude imports in October have broadly remained in line with expectations at 1.6 million bpd.However, Russian crude shipments have seen a drop of 180,000 from the average volumes imported during the first eight months of 2025, says the report.The drop in the imports is purely driven by market dynamics and not because of US tariff threat and European criticism against India’s continued purchase of those barrels.","Lok sabha leader of opposition rahul gandhi on thursday lashed out at prime minister narendra modi.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Adam Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk, and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Adam Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

Gold price prediction in Diwali week: Gold prices are likely to trade range-bound in the Diwali week, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Here is his outlook for gold prices in the coming days:Gold and Silver continued to mark new all-time highs last week as well, only to lose strength on the last day. Safe haven buying was witnessed amid renewed US-China trade tensions and deepening geopolitical and economic uncertainties. Gold inched towards $4,400 level gaining more than 60% year-to-date, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of further US interest rate cuts, strong ETF inflows, and robust central bank buying.Silver also soared, crossing $52 on COMEX — an all-time high — as acute global supply shortages and backwardation signalled severe tightness in the market. Domestic premiums surged, reflecting heightened volatility.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese exports and fresh export controls on US software, while China expanded its rare earth export restrictions. Tensions escalated with reciprocal port fees and threats over Chinese oil imports from Russia.Amid a prolonged US government shutdown, key economic data releases may be delayed, amplifying market anxiety. Fed Chair Powell, at the NABE conference, indicated that future rate decisions would be data-dependent, acknowledging persistent labor market weakness and inflation risks. The IMF raised its global growth forecast but warned of headwinds from the trade war.However, on the other side of the story, President Trump quickly took a softer side, keeping the market unsure regarding the 100% tariffs on China, over the weekend ceasefire was on the side lines and attacks continued. In India, soaring bullion prices during Dhanteras led to a shift from jewellery to coins and bars, as gold reserves crossed $100 billion. MCX also revised margin requirements for Gold and Silver, effective October 14.Gold and Silver also amidst the signs of extreme elevated prices eased off from all time levels, where silver fell by more than 5% in a single day. Supply tightness continues in the market however, premiums in ETFs, physical continue to ease off weighing on domestic exchange prices as well.

Waqf Golden Visa: The UAE eyeing for strategic significance

Looking ahead: How to get started

Awqaf Dubai – for donation guidelines and nomination

GDRFA Smart Services – for Golden Visa application

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this strategic move, the UAE is strongly reinforcing its long-term commitment to becoming a leading global humanitarian capital. The innovative partnership between GDRFA-Dubai and Awqaf Dubai is also expected to usher in a new era of digitally-enabled, impactful social initiatives, wherein charitable giving is not just encouraged but actively integrated into national development policy and sustainable growth.Those interested can begin by visiting:","The united arab emirates announced new golden visa for waqf donors.

Trump mocks movement





Large crowds of protesters gathered across all 50 states of the US on Saturday against President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched into its third week amid a legislative deadlock.While the protesters called the demonstration the “No Kings” movement, Republicans ridiculed it as “Hate America” rallies.Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states including Washington, Los Angeles, Montana, and several other places.More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states — from major cities such as Washington D.C. and New York to small towns across the Midwest.In San Francisco, hundreds of people spelled out “No King!” and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she had never attended a protest before. Only recently, she began to view Trump as a “dictator.”“This is what democracy looks like!” chanted thousands in Washington near the US Capitol, where the federal government remained shut for a third week amid a legislative deadlock.Demonstrators slammed what they called the Republican billionaire’s strong-arm tactics, including attacks on the media, political opponents, and undocumented immigrants.It was the third mass mobilization since Trump’s return to the White House and came against the backdrop of a government shutdown that not only closed federal programs and services but also tested the core balance of power, as an aggressive executive confronts Congress and the courts in ways protest organizers warn are a slide toward authoritarianism.The dissidents were also protesting several specific policies and actions of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal forces and National Guard troops into US cities — viewed as an overreach of federal power and militarization of communities — sweeping immigration enforcement raids and policies leading to deportations and alleged injustices, and the government shutdown’s impact on the federal workforce and essential services.Meanwhile, Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.“They say they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” the president said in a Fox News interview that aired early Friday, before departing for a $1 million-per-plate MAGA Inc. fundraiser at his club.Trump’s campaign social media account also mocked the protests by posting a computer-generated video of the president dressed like a monarch, wearing a crown and waving from a balcony.Republican leaders called the protesters “communists” and “Marxists.” They said Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, are beholden to the far-left flank and willing to keep the government shut down to appease those liberal forces.“I encourage you to watch — we call it the Hate America rally — that will happen Saturday,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana.“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson added, listing groups including “antifa types,” people who “hate capitalism,” and “Marxists in full display.”","Demonstrators picketed outside capitols in several republican-led states including washington, los angeles, montana, and several other places.

Explained: What was Saudi Arabia’s Kafala system and why its abolition is a historic moment for migrant workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/explained-what-was-saudi-arabias-kafala-system-and-why-its-abolition-is-a-historic-moment-for-migrant-workers/articleshow/124689473.cms,"Saudi Arabia’s labour reforms mark a major shift, easing worker mobility and reducing Kafala dependency to promote fair employment rights / Illustration generated by AI

What was the Kafala system?

Change employers

Leave the country (many needed an “exit visa”)

Seek legal recourse if abused

Why was it so controversial?

Around 13.4 million migrant workers live in Saudi Arabia, nearly 42% of the population.

Millions come from South and Southeast Asia, including India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.

An estimated 4 million are domestic workers, often isolated and vulnerable to abuse.

Why is Saudi Arabia abolishing it now?

What’s changed under the new system?

Freedom to change jobs: Workers can move to a new employer without needing approval from their current one.

Freedom to exit: They can leave the country without an exit visa or sponsor consent.

Legal protections: Workers will have improved access to labour courts and complaint mechanisms.

How much will life really change?

Implementation gaps remain: many employers still demand consent for job changes or control exit visas.

Domestic workers among the most vulnerable may not benefit equally from new protections.

Recruitment abuses in origin countries (like high fees and contract substitution) are still common and not addressed by Saudi law.

Why this matters





For over half a century, a single word defined the lives of millions of foreign workers in the Gulf: kafala, Arabic for “sponsorship.” It decided whether they could change jobs, whether they could leave the country, and whether they could fight back against abuse. It was a system critics compared to “modern-day slavery.”Now, for the first time in 50 years, that system has officially been abolished in Saudi Arabia, where roughly 13 million foreign workers make up the backbone of the economy. But what exactly was the kafala system? Why was it so controversial? And how much will life really change for those who lived under it? The kafala system was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. It emerged in the 1950s, when oil-rich economies needed cheap labour to build cities and infrastructure but wanted to avoid granting permanent residency or citizenship.Under kafala, a foreign worker’s legal status was tied entirely to their employer, or kafeel. This sponsor controlled their visa, their right to live in the country, and often their ability to change jobs or even exit the country. Without the sponsor’s approval, workers could not:The system was designed to minimise state bureaucracy and regulate labour through private sponsors.But in practice, it created an enormous power imbalance. Employers could confiscate passports, withhold wages, or threaten deportation, and workers had almost no way to challenge them.Over the decades, kafala became one of the most criticised labour systems in the world. Human rights groups and the International Labour Organization (ILO) accused Gulf governments of enabling forced labour and human trafficking under the guise of sponsorship.Because workers risked arrest or deportation if they left their jobs without permission, many remained in exploitative or abusive situations — particularly in domestic work, construction, and agriculture. In extreme cases, NGOs documented conditions resembling indentured servitude.The scale was staggering:The decision to abolish kafala, announced in June 2025, is part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s sweeping plan to diversify the Saudi economy, attract foreign investment, and modernise its global image.The move also reflects mounting international pressure. Ahead of high-profile events and partnerships, Gulf states have faced criticism from global rights groups, Western governments, and even multinational companies over their labour records. Qatar, for instance, introduced partial reforms ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Saudi Arabia says it is replacing kafala with a contract-based employment system that aims to restore agency to workers. Key changes include:Officials say the reforms will boost productivity, reduce exploitation, and improve Saudi Arabia’s reputation among investors and the international community.The announcement is a breakthrough but experts caution that legal reforms alone won’t end abuse overnight.Rights groups point out that:“Changing the law is the first step,” says Human Rights Watch. “Changing the reality on the ground will take much longer.”For millions of migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, and beyond, the end of kafala is more than just legal reform, it’s a restoration of basic rights long denied. The ability to walk away from an abusive employer, to leave the country freely, or to seek justice without fear marks a fundamental shift in how Gulf economies treat the workers who sustain them.For Saudi Arabia, it’s a signal to the world that the kingdom is serious about modernisation and understands that economic reform must go hand in hand with human rights reform. But as activists note, this is not the end of the kafala story — it’s the beginning of a new chapter. The true test will be whether Saudi Arabia enforces these rights in practice and whether other Gulf states follow its lead.The abolition of the kafala system is undoubtedly one of the most significant labour reforms in the modern Middle East in recent decades. It promises freedom, dignity, and legal protection to millions of vulnerable migrant workers, but the gap between law and lived reality remains a challenge that will ultimately define the next phase of the Gulf’s labour history.","Kafala was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the gulf cooperation council (gcc) states.
