'Consumption Going Up': U.S. Eyes India As A Major Market For Its Energy Exports





The White House on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India and is in frequent contact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as differences continue over trade tariffs and oil imports from Russia.WHite House also called the India-US partnership one that the President values “very strongly,”At a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship. A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Leavitt added that the US has ""a great Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor,"" and confirmed that Trump’s trade team is in “very serious discussions” with New Delhi. “I know the President has great respect for Prime Minister Modi and they speak pretty frequently,” she said.Her remarks come days after Trump claimed India had reduced its purchase of Russian oil, describing New Delhi as “very good” on the issue during his five-day Asia tour.Since mid-October, Trump has repeatedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would limit or stop crude imports from Moscow.Trump’s statements are linked to his administration’s efforts to isolate Russia economically through sanctions and energy restrictions amid the war in Ukraine.However, earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded to Trump’s comments, saying that the country’s energy sourcing decisions are driven by national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”He added that India’s energy policy aims to ensure stable prices and secure supplies through diversified sourcing. “Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement. This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” Jaiswal said.Ties between India and the US have come under strain after Washington imposed high trade tariffs on New Delhi in August. The US levied 50 per cent tariffs, including 25 per cent secondary duties, as a response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia.India criticised the move as “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while Trump described US-India trade ties as a “totally one-sided disaster.”",Us president donald trump remains committed to strengthening ties with india.

Shutdown 'TURBULENCE' Hits U.S. Aviation; Unpaid Air Traffic Controllers Threaten Flight Ops

NEW DELHI: Air India will operate a relief flight on Tuesday to bring back 228 passengers stranded in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. This comes after the airline's San Francisco–Delhi flight was diverted on Monday due to a technical issue.The airline said the special relief flight, numbered AI183, will depart from Delhi on Tuesday afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning. The flight will be operated using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.The diversion occurred after pilots on flight AI174, operating from San Francisco to Delhi via Kolkata, detected a possible technical issue mid-air and made a precautionary landing at Ulaanbaatar. The Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 245 people, including 228 passengers and 17 crew members, landed safely.“Air India will be operating a relief flight to ferry the passengers of flight AI174 (San Francisco–Delhi of November 2), which was diverted to Ulaanbaatar on Monday. The ferry flight AI183 is scheduled to depart Delhi this afternoon and return with the affected passengers on Wednesday morning,” an Air India spokesperson said.The airline added that it has been working closely with local authorities and the Indian Embassy in Mongolia to assist all passengers and crew. Arrangements for hotel accommodation, meals and regular updates have been made for those stranded.“At Air India, the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew remain our top priority,” the spokesperson said.Air India confirmed that the diverted Boeing 777 is undergoing necessary technical checks in Ulaanbaatar. Once cleared by engineers, the aircraft will be flown back separately.This is not the first time an Air India long-haul flight has had to divert due to technical reasons. In 2023, an Air India San Francisco–Delhi flight made a precautionary landing in Magadan, Russia, after a technical issue was detected mid-air.Another diversion occurred in 2024, when a flight on the same route landed in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. In both cases, passengers were later repatriated using alternate aircraft.","Air india will operate a relief flight on tuesday to bring back 228 passengers stranded in ulaanbaatar, mongolia.

Can the EPA's Pollution Limits Curb Climate Change?

NEW DELHI: The global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, with India reporting the highest absolute increase in emissions followed by China, Russia, Indonesia and the US, showed a UN report released on Tuesday. It warned the world is “heading for a serious escalation of climate risks and damages”.It said that the global average temperature is projected to rise 2.3-2.5 degree Celsius by the end of the century above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) even if the climate actions are fully implemented under the new mitigation goals of the countries amid rising carbon emissions. It means the new climate pledges are completely off target and fall short on the warming limit goal.The absolute increase in emissions excludes the emission caused by change in land use and forest cover due uncertainties in estimates of net emission from such factors. It primarily calculates emissions of fossil CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases.Currently, the six largest emitters in terms of total GHG emissions are China, the US, India, EU, Russia and Indonesia. The report noted that among the big emitters, the European Union was the only one to decrease emissions in 2024.“The 2.3% increase in total GHG emissions (globally in 2024) from 2023 levels is high compared with the 2022–2023 increase of 1.6%. It is more than four times higher than the annual average growth rate in the 2010s (0.6% per year), and comparable to the emissions growth in the 2000s (on average 2.2% per year),” said the report.In terms of growth rate, Indonesia showed the highest increase (4.6%) followed by India (3.6%). Emissions growth in China (0.5% in 2024) was lower than the previous year.The report underlined that the contributions by current, per capita and historic emissions differ across the high emitters and world regions. Per capita GHG emissions are above the world average of 6.4 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) in the US, Russia, China and EU, and remain significantly below it in Indonesia and India.Flagging how the growing emission and the countries' low mitigation targets put the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degree C of warming at risk in the short-term (within the next decade), the report - UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2025 - noted that the rise will go up to 2.8 degree Celsius in the business-as-usual scenario under the ongoing policies.Though the current projected rise of 2.3-2.5 degree C is an improvement over the previous year’s projection of 2.6-2.8 degree C rise, the report noted that the updated pledges are not adequate to get the desired result of keeping the global warming either within 1.5 degree C or 2 degree C. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement 10 years ago, temperature rise predictions have, however, fallen from 3-3.5 degree C — a clear sign that the world can keep it further down with more ambitious emission reduction targets.The report said that the reductions to annual emissions of 35% and 55%, compared with 2019 levels, are needed by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement 2 degree C and 1.5 degree C pathways, respectively.“While national climate plans have delivered some progress, it is nowhere near fast enough, which is why we still need unprecedented emissions cuts in an increasingly tight window, with an increasingly challenging geopolitical backdrop,” said Inger Andersen, executive director, UNEP.The report comes as a warning signal to governments ahead of the UN climate conference (COP30), scheduled to be held in Belem, Brazil during Nov 10-21.Despite the Paris Agreement requirement to submit new climate action targets - called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - by February, only 64 countries covering 63% of global GHG emissions had submitted or announced new NDCs by the cut-off date of Sept 30. India is expected to submit its target for 2035 in the next few days.“Nations have had three attempts to deliver promises made under the Paris Agreement, and each time they have landed off target,” said Andersen.The report noted that though NDCs have, overall, become modestly more robust over time, it’s at nowhere near the pace needed, and the new NDCs have done little to accelerate progress.“In addition to the lack of progress in pledges, a huge implementation gap remains, with countries not on track to meet their 2030 NDCs, let alone new 2035 targets,” it said.","The global greenhouse gas (ghg) emission increased by 2.3% in 2024, compared to the previous year, to reach a record high of 57.7 gigatons of co2 equivalent. India reported the highest absolute increase in emissions followed by china, russia, indonesia and the us.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125092360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40204,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

BATHINDA: Over 170 leading organisations, experts, artists and activists from across the world – representing parliamentarians, health professionals, sustainable businesses, Indigenous communities, workers, children and young people, and concerned citizens – have signed an open letter urging governments and policymakers to put health at the heart of climate action at COP30 in Belém, Brazil.The letter has been sent to over 50 health ministers and other policymakers from every continent ahead of COP30 to ensure its demands are firmly on the agenda for this year’s political negotiations.The open letter signed by a diverse range of global organisations and individuals, including Filmmaker Adam McKay, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, Amnesty International, Child Rights International Network, COP30 Youth Climate Champion Marcele Oliveira, COP30 Health Envoy Ethel Maciel, Force of Nature, Global Climate and Health Alliance, Médicins Sans Frontières, Public Services International, Olio, Resilient Cities Network, UNITE Parliamentarians Network for Global Health, Climate Activists Vanessa Nakate, Disha Ravi, Luisa Neubauer, Tori Tsui, and more, is spearheaded by Think-Film Impact Production for its ‘healthy planet now’ campaign.The letter demands that national leaders recognise the escalating health crisis driven by fossil fuel dependency and climate breakdown and respond with policies that prioritise public health and wellbeing within and beyond the Belem Health Action Plan (BHAP).At COP30, governments are expected to adopt the BHAP—a global roadmap for climate-resilient and sustainable health systems co-developed by Brazil's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO).Signatories stress that the BHAP is promising, but must go further, including by naming fossil fuels as a central threat to human health and committing real resources to adaptation and prevention.Five fundamental action points have been outlined for the countries in the letter, urging to phase out fossil fuels for a just, healthy transition. Finance local climate action that strengthens systems and builds resilience. Keep climate and health policy free from harmful industry influence. Integrate health and wellbeing across climate, environment, nature, food, energy, transport, and other policies, narratives and targets. Embed planetary health education and training across systems for better worker safety and patient outcomes.“Promoting resilient health systems is a central objective of the COP30 Action Agenda. Efforts like this Open Letter are helping build a broad coalition to drive implementation of the Belém Health Action Plan and its shared goals. I am pleased to add my name as the COP30 Health Envoy and to see a wide range of partners doing the same as we move closer to the 30th Conference of the Parties in Belém. This letter sends an unequivocal message that health is an essential component of climate action. ” Ethel Maciel, COP30 Special Envoy for Health“The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue. It is a health and human rights emergency. Governments need to take decisive action to fully phase out fossil fuels, to save lives, build resilient communities and uphold people's right to a healthy environment.” Dr. Marta Schaaf, Director of the Program on Climate, Economic, and Social Justice, and Corporate Accountability, Amnesty International“Public service workers are the frontline responders to climate catastrophes. From firefighters and emergency personnel to nurses and public transport operators, a rapid transition to low-carbon activities is essential to safeguard their wellbeing and ensure a resilient workforce."" Daniel Bertossa, General Secretary, Public Services International""Nurses are at the frontlines of climate change, protecting the health of communities while fossil-fuel driven climate change strains health systems already stretched thin. To adapt to our changing climate, climate and planetary health must be a mandatory part of healthcare worker training worldwide."" Cara Cook, Deputy Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy EnvironmentsThe letter highlights and warns that climate change is already “a direct public health emergency”, linking fossil fuel combustion to nearly 8 million premature deaths each year, and highlighting the mental health toll on communities facing displacement, extreme heat and pollution. It further emphasises the urgency for governments to act to make health a strategic priority and mainstream it across sectors, whilst identifying the importance of implementing both top-down structural solutions and finance, and bottom-up support and incentives for localised and community efforts.""COP30 is not just another climate summit — it’s a defining moment to put people’s health and lives at the center of climate decisions, ensuring a just transition that safeguards communities, families, and future generations."" Jeni Miller, Director, Global Climate and Health AllianceThe Healthy Planet Now initiative is associated with an upcoming documentary film, My Planet Now , produced by Sandpaper Films and co-directed by Jenny Saunders and Henry Singer, a participatory documentary following individuals across the globe as they deal firsthand with the impacts of climate-related challenges and step up to take action. Many of the contributors’ stories shine a light on the health impacts of climate breakdown and our dependence on fossil fuels. The film inspires audiences worldwide to take climate action, with Healthy Planet Now spearheading a new wave of people demanding change.“Every signature on this letter represents a shared story of human resilience and hope. It is essential that policy leaders champion films like My Planet Now, which translate the urgency of the climate and health crisis into emotion and movement - because only when people feel the story will they fight to change its ending.” Amy Shepherd, Chief Operating Officer, Think-Film Impact Production.","Over 170 organisations, experts, artists and activists from across the world have signed an open letter urging governments and policymakers to put health at the heart of climate action.

Gold Card versus EB-5





EB-5's rising momentum





MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite its high approval rate, the EB-5 route remains a risky mix of financial investment, immigration strategy, and trust in the US market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked green card program (eb-5) comes in handy for those h-1bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted green card. The eb-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (hnis) in india, who are looking at securing their children's future.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125044020,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1373072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Indira Gandhi proved herself by sacrificing her life,"" Tiwari said.""Rajiv Gandhi served this country by sacrificing his life. So, if someone talks about the Gandhi family as a dynasty, then which other family in India had the sacrifice, dedication, and ability that this family possessed? Was it BJP?"" he asked.Congress leader Rashid Alvi also interjected Tharoor and said that the public makes decisions in a democracy and no one can be restricted from contesting elections because their father was an MP.""The public makes the decisions in a democracy. You cannot impose a restriction that says you cannot contest elections because your father was an MP. This is happening in every field. What way will you find this?"" Alvi said.Congress leader Udit Raj said that dynastic approach isn't limited to politics and spreads across sectors in the country.""A doctor's son becomes a doctor, a businessman's child continues in business, and politics is no exception. Also, if a politician has a criminal background, it reflects the reality of our society. Election tickets are often distributed along caste and family lines,"" Udit raj told news agency ANI.This comes after Tharoor, in an article, pointed out that while the Nehru-Gandhi family is associated with the Congress, dynastic succession prevails across the political spectrum.He said that when political power is determined by lineage rather than ability, commitment, or grassroots engagement, the quality of governance suffers.He said the influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- including independent India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra -- is bound up with the history of India's struggle for freedom.""But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright. This idea has penetrated Indian politics across every party, in every region, and at every level,"" Tharoor said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party seized on to Tharoor's remarks, calling it a ""very insightful piece"" on how Indian politics has become a family business.""He (Tharoor) has launched a direct attack on India's nepo kid Rahul and chota nepo kid Tejaswi Yadav!"" BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said.Tharoor’s relationship with the Congress leadership has been under strain since he contested the party president election against Mallikarjun Kharge.The friction reportedly intensified when his name did not appear on the list of Congress leaders suggested for the Union government's Operation Sindoor outreach.Despite this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi later invited Tharoor to lead a delegation to the United States and other countries in the Americas. Tharoor's public statements, including those interpreted as favourable towards the Prime Minister, have also caused discomfort within the CongressThe rift came into sharper focus following his recent remarks and social media posts that appeared to challenge the party’s leadership.",Congress mp pramod tiwari said that former prime ministers indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi from the nehru family sacrificed their lives.

“I don’t have any interest…”: Joe Alwyn’s old comments about Taylor Swift resurfaces and fans claim Travis Kelce is the total opposite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-dont-have-any-interest-joe-alwyns-old-comments-about-taylor-swift-resurfaces-and-fans-claim-travis-kelce-is-the-total-opposite/articleshow/124992561.cms,"Taylor Swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with Joe Alwyn to a public spectacle with Travis Kelce. While Alwyn offered quiet devotion, Kelce brings an open, expressive joy. Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering”

From Joe Alwyn’s quiet loyalty to Travis Kelce’s bold devotion





Before Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce captured the world’s attention, the singer experienced a very different kind of love with British actor Joe Alwyn . Their six-year relationship was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion, a stark contrast to the spotlight-fueled excitement surrounding her current relationship.Joe Alwyn’s composed attitude toward fame and his ability to protect their bond from media noise once defined Swift’s most peaceful chapter. Now, years later, Swift appears to have found joy in a more open and expressive love with Kelce. From game-day appearances to public displays of affection, she seems more confident and carefree than ever, embracing happiness on her own terms while rewriting what love looks like in her world. ..In a 2019 interview with The Sunday Times, Hollywood actor Joe Alwyn was asked about the experience of having some of pop sensation Taylor Swift’s biggest love songs inspired by him. His response was characteristically grounded and gentle. “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” he said with a calm smile..At the time, Taylor Swift had just released Lover, an album filled with romantic anthems like “London Boy” and “Cornelia Street”, both widely believed to be about Alwyn.Even on her previous record Reputation, songs such as “Call It What You Want” and “King of My Heart” hinted at their growing bond. Swift once described that era as one of emotional safety, telling fans she had found “stability” away from chaos.What made Joe Alwyn stand out during their six-year relationship was his ability to tune out the noise. He told The Times he simply ignored media speculation: “I don’t have any interest in tabloids. I know what I want to do, and that’s this, and that’s what I am doing.”Taylor Swift echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Guardian, explaining, “I’ve learned that if I do [discuss my relationship], people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”Today, as Swift navigates a far more public love story with Travis Kelce, one often unfolding under stadium lights and social media frenzy, some fans can’t help but look back at her time with Alwyn as the quiet before the storm.However, Taylor Swift has never looked happier than she does with Travis Kelce. Friends close to the couple say she’s “glowing” and genuinely enjoying a new sense of freedom she didn’t always have in past relationships. Unlike her quieter years with Joe Alwyn, Swift seems to thrive in this more public love story, cheering from VIP boxes, holding hands after games, and embracing the spotlight with confidence.Those close to her note that Kelce’s openness and playful energy have brought out her fun, carefree side, describing their bond as “easy, supportive, and real.” For Swift, this chapter feels less like hiding from fame and more like finally living out loud, on her own terms.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials Earlier in 2024, insiders told People that Joe Alwyn had turned the page on his relationship with Taylor Swift and begun seeing someone new. The sources added that the actor was content with where he was in life, balancing a healthy personal life with a strong professional focus. They also noted that Alwyn has always spoken respectfully about Swift, acknowledging that while he deeply cared for her, their relationship simply ran its course.","Taylor swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with joe alwyn to a public spectacle with travis kelce.

New York Mets Exploring Power Options in the NL East

Braves Adopting a New DH Philosophy

Why Marcell Ozuna Fits Perfectly in New York

Player Current Team Awards Estimated Contract Potential Role with Mets Marcell Ozuna Atlanta Braves 3× All-Star, 2× Silver Slugger, Gold Glove $65 Million (existing deal) Power bat, DH/OF option

Theare entering a crucial offseason, and all eyes are on the uncertain future of their franchise slugger, Pete Alonso. With Alonso potentially heading toward free agency or a trade, the Mets could be forced to find a new power bat to anchor their lineup. One intriguing - and surprising - name emerging as a potential target is Atlanta Braves veteranOzuna, a three-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, and Gold Glove winner, has been a central figure in the Braves’ offensive success in recent seasons. Now, as Atlanta reportedly looks to shift its approach to the designated hitter position, Ozuna’s future with the team appears uncertain - and the Mets could take advantage of that situation.With Alonso’s future hanging in the balance, New York Mets’ front office is expected to explore every avenue to maintain offensive firepower. Ozuna could offer a proven, right-handed power bat capable of driving in runs and keeping pressure on opposing pitchers. The 34-year-old slugger remains a formidable threat at the plate, known for his ability to produce consistent power numbers and handle high-leverage situations.Last season, the Braves reportedly attempted to trade Marcell Ozuna at the deadline, but multiple deals fell through. The veteran, who holds 10-5 rights (10 years in MLB, 5 with the same team), was said to have vetoed three separate trade proposals. Despite that, the expectation heading into 2026 is that Atlanta could revisit potential moves involving him as they adjust their roster strategy.Reports suggest that Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos and his staff are leaning toward a more flexible approach for the designated hitter role. Instead of relying on a full-time DH, the team plans to rotate players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Jurickson Profar, Sean Murphy, and Matt Olson through the position to keep them fresh. This marks a strategic shift that could make Ozuna expendable as Atlanta focuses on lineup versatility for the 2026 campaign.If Alonso departs, the New York Mets will need an established veteran presence to fill the void in the middle of their order. Marcell Ozuna’s proven track record and familiarity with NL East pitching make him an ideal candidate. A short-term deal - likely one or two years - would give New York both stability and flexibility while allowing Ozuna to continue showcasing his value.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers could sign $130 million Philadelphia Phillies All-Star as he prepares to enter free agency Seeing Marcell Ozuna in Mets colors would certainly shock fans, given his long-standing rivalry with New York as a Brave. However, the move could be exactly what the New York Mets need to stay competitive in the NL East. If Alonso’s time in Queens is nearing its end, Ozuna could serve as both a short-term spark and a bridge to the next era of Mets baseball - ensuring the team’s power production doesn’t skip a beat heading into 2026.","Marcell ozuna is a three-time all-star, two-time silver slugger, and gold glove winner.

MAGA Attacks, Racist Slurs: Zohran Mamdani's Battle For NYC In Trump's America

The controversy

Why it matters

The reaction

The bottom line





An internal memo has accused the BBC of breaching impartiality over a Panorama episode that allegedly distorted Donald Trump ’s words from his January 6 speech.The BBC is under fire after a leaked internal memo accused its flagship investigative programme Panorama of misleading viewers by editing Donald Trump’s 2021 Capitol riot speech in a way that changed its meaning. The one-hour episode, titled Trump: A Second Chance?, aired in October 2024—just a week before the US election—and allegedly spliced two separate sections of the former president’s address to make him appear to call for violence.Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, submitted a 19-page dossier to the BBC board alleging “shocking” breaches of impartiality. He said the episode had “completely misled” viewers by merging Trump’s calm call to “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard” with his later exhortation to “fight like hell”, which referred to contesting the 2020 election results.Prescott claimed that an internal review led by senior adviser David Grossman supported his concerns, but that BBC executives rejected the findings. Jonathan Munro, the BBC’s senior controller of news content, reportedly defended the broadcast, saying it was standard practice to shorten long speeches for context.Prescott countered that the splicing “set a very, very dangerous precedent.”The BBC’s credibility rests on its reputation for balance and accuracy. Allegations that its own editorial staff manipulated footage from one of the most consequential political moments in recent American history threaten to undermine that reputation. The timing—days before a US presidential election—only magnified the fallout.Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., blasted the BBC on social media, accusing British journalists of being “as dishonest as the ones in America.” The broadcaster declined to comment directly on the leak, saying only that it “takes all feedback seriously” and routinely debates differing views on coverage.The memo adds to growing scrutiny of the BBC’s editorial judgement at a time when public trust in media is fraying worldwide. For an organisation built on the promise of impartiality, the question now isn’t just whether Panorama got it wrong—but whether the BBC still knows how to get it right.","An internal memo has accused the bbc of breaching impartiality over a panorama episode that allegedly distorted donald trump ’s words from his january 6 speech.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold



Also Read |





For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The asian arowana (scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

Jason Kelce celebrates Disney tradition with Kylie and mom Donna just days before turning 38 with no sign of Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-celebrates-disney-tradition-with-kylie-and-mom-donna-just-days-before-turning-38-with-no-sign-of-travis-kelce/articleshow/125098872.cms,"Retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, wife Kylie, and mother Donna were recently spotted at Walt Disney World, continuing a family tradition. This low-key outing, captured by fans and highlighted by Donna's social media posts, showcases the Kelce family's authentic, consistent presence amidst their public lives. Their return to Disney emphasizes real-life moments over celebrity spectacle.

Donna Kelce’s sunrise clip becomes another subtle moment in the “Kelce family era”

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

Jason Kelce may be retired, but his family calendar isn’t slowing down and fans are eating it up. Ahead of his 38th birthday on Nov. 5, the former Philadelphia Eagles center was spotted back at Walt Disney World with wife Kylie and mom Donna, continuing a pattern that feels less like a vacation and more like a Kelce family tradition.Over the weekend, guests in Magic Kingdom claimed they briefly crossed paths with the couple in Tomorrowland, grabbing snacks and browsing merch before moving along like any other parent with a stroller and a to-do list. For a family that’s lived half the last decade in headlines, from Jason’s documentary era, to Swift/Kelce family mashups, to the NFL goodbye, the image of this trio quietly roaming Orlando hits differently.This latest getaway gained momentum after Donna posted a peaceful sunrise clip from the Grand Floridian, writing: “Waking up overlooking [the] Magic Kingdom over the lake from the Grand Floridian… ahhhhh.” She zoomed in on Space Mountain and Tron, two details that Disney fans instantly knew meant she wasn’t exaggerating.Donna doesn’t have to address controversy or commentary (and there’s always some around a Kelce), she just posts what she sees and that subtle, steady presence has become part of why this family remains publicly likable in a celebrity climate that’s become hyper-performative.But this trip isn’t new and that’s the story that matters. The Kelces don’t treat Disney as a press moment. They simply keep going back. February. November. Pro Bowl years. Girls trips. Chip ‘n Dale. Elsa stop-ins. Matching ears. The pattern proves consistency and online consistency is authenticity.And that may be why fans still respond more to Jason and Kylie offline, even now, with their orbit permanently tied to the most dissected entertainment-sports crossover in the world, because their most viral moments still come from moments like this: Parents. A stroller. Magic Kingdom. A sunrise. A birthday week. Real life.","Jason kelce, wife kylie, and mother donna were recently spotted at walt disney world.

Fans accuse Kayla Nicole of taking direct aim at Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

The internet doesn’t need much to explode when the names Travis Kelce Taylor Swift , and Kayla Nicole land in the same sentence, but this time, the gasoline was poured by Nicole herself. The former girlfriend of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted a Halloween video dressed as Toni Braxton and lip-syncing the iconic breakup anthem “He Wasn’t Man Enough.”Within minutes, Swift fans, already hypersensitive about anyone shading Taylor or Kelce’s engagement, framed the entire thing as a personal attack. And Kayla didn’t exactly pour water on the raging speculation either. On her “Pre-Game” podcast, she offered a childhood backstory that only made the controversy messier, more confusing, and far more viral.Kayla Nicole said the song was meaningful because she had a white childhood friend named Taylor who listened to it in the school pickup line, an explanation that Swift fans immediately labeled delusional. One tweet went straight for the jugular: “the white girl’s name was what now? this is mental illness and I’m being so serious. this woman needs an intervention from loved ones.” Another piled on by writing, “WHITE FRIEND NAMED TAYLOR. Oh she’s haunted.”Some fans didn’t bother softening anything at all. “She can’t go one second without embarrassing herself!!! Girl, you’re over 30… Go back to chasing rich men, it suits you better,” one critic blasted.And what really escalated everything wasn’t Kayla, but her own circle. Her choreographer, Shaun Andru, confirmed on TikTok that the post was a dig at Kelce and Swift. One of her close friends, Tatiana Elizabeth, also hinted the same.Meanwhile, Kelce and the Chiefs sit at 5-4 heading into a Week 10 BYE, with Kelce’s production still crucial for Kansas City’s playoff path. But for a few days, the internet didn’t care about numbers, touchdowns, or Denver. They cared about Toni Braxton and whether Kayla just used her to throw gasoline at Taylor Swift’s fan army.","Kayla nicole's halloween video, lip-syncing toni braxton's ""he wasn't man enough,"" sparked accusations of a dig at travis kelce and taylor swift.

'I'm Broken': Lone AI-171 Crash Survivor Speaks Out; Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK

‘Completely Broken Down’

Viswashkumar Ramesh and his brother Ajaykumar

Getting On A Plane, Again

Early Days In Leicester

With Almost No Income Now

‘Situation Is Desperate’





On June 12, the whole world saw him walk away, alone, from the burning wreckage of the crashed AI 171 flight from Ahmedabad to London’s Gatwick. There was black smoke billowing out of the Air India flight, its tail end sticking out of a building where it had crashed, and, on the ground, this man in a white tee and grey trousers, walking with a slight limp, and repeating over and over again, “Plane fatyo che ! Plane fatyo che ! (The plane has exploded!)”He was the lone survivor. There were 242 on board that flight — 230 passengers and 12 crew members; 241 of them were dead, some charred beyond recognition. How could anyone walk out of that wreckage? This was a miracle to beat all miracles — an outcome only a very benign God could have ordained.And yet, a little over four and a half months later, when we meet Viswashkumar Ramesh, the 39-year-old lone crash survivor, he looks crushed and depressed, hardly someone who has beaten impossible odds and survived. What he is left with now is the struggle of picking up the pieces; but it’s a task for which he says he is yet to receive the help he needs, from the airline and the govt of UK, the country of his citizenship.We are in Leicester, UK, at the residence of Sanjiv Patel, a community leader. A silver Volvo SUV pulls up, and Viswash gets off. He lives nearby, but walking has been an issue ever since he jumped — or fell? — off the burning plane. Because of his mobility issues, he has also stopped driving. So, Patel — who is voluntarily helping the family — has organised for his pickup.Viswash hobbles into the room. He looks like a broken man, dazed, unable to focus or fully engage, morose, a haunted man.“After this tragedy — not just my wife and son — my whole family is all completely broken down. Me — physically, mentally — and my family also,” he says.On the plane, Viswash had been seated in 11A, next to the emergency exit. His younger brother, Ajaykumar, was in seat 11J. He was among the 241 who died. Viswash spent a few days in hospital, and then went back to Diu, where he is originally from. The two brothers used to run a fishing business there. While in Diu, Viswash underwent medical treatment at Rajkot.He came back to the UK on Sept 15 to get on with his medical treatment under NHS (the British medical service, which is free for all citizens) and to be with his wife Hiral and four-year-old son Divang, who’s just started school. However, he has not yet seen any doctor in the NHS nor received any psychiatric treatment or counselling in the UK.It is immediately clear that weighing heavily against the relief of his miraculous escape is the lingering grief for his brother’s death and the psychological trauma of having survived a crash in which everyone else on board died. Ever since he came back, he has spent most of his time holed up in his two-bedroom terraced house, hardly ever stepping out.Ask him what it feels like to be a miraculous survivor, and he goes silent. Then he says, “I lost my younger brother.”Just getting back to the UK was a challenge. “It was very difficult to get on an aeroplane.” He did not fly Air India and took another carrier instead. “I was very scared. I just closed my eyes and prayed to my God.“I don’t talk with my son and wife. I just keep sitting in my room alone. Because of the tragedy, whole flashbacks come to me.“My son doesn’t speak much, he is just four years old, he doesn’t understand much of what has happened, just a little bit. My wife is struggling. My shoulder, back, knee, left side are burning — there is still pain in my body. I walk slowly. I have not gone outside of the house much. I am not walking properly. I can’t drive. Mentally, I have completely broken down,” he says.“The fishing business has completely gone down. Me and my brother (Ajay) were doing it together. After this tragedy it is almost finished. My father is trying, but struggling,” Viswash says.Can he get back to his old life? “I don’t know,” he says.His parents moved to the UK about 25 years ago. His father, Ramesh, set up a garments business in Leicester. Viswash, who was born in Diu, moved to the UK when he was around 14. “I came to Leicester with my parents to start studying. Then, after a few years, I started to support my family in the garments business,” he says.However, the family wound up the UK clothing business during Covid and reinvested their money in a fishing venture in Diu. The entire extended family in Diu and Leicester were deriving their income from that business, which, Vishwas claims, had been growing steadily.Viswash and Ajay were the two key people who were hands-on in running the venture. They would spend eight to nine months in Diu and, then, around the time the fishing season ended, they would come back to the UK for three months and spend time with their families in Leicester.Then their world fell apart. Ramesh, Viswash, and his two other younger brothers — Nayankumar and Sunnykumar — tried to run it for a while after the crash, from Diu, but it proved impossible. Viswash was too traumatised to leave his Diu house. The fishermen themselves needed income and, after the crash, the family’s boats couldn’t operate for a while, so the fishermen went to look for other work. The business has virtually collapsed now.Air India has offered Viswash an interim payment of £21,500 (Rs 25 lakh) — the same payment it is offering the families of those who died in the crash. The interim payment will be adjusted against any final compensation.With Patel, in whose house we are meeting, is Radd Seiger, a retired lawyer and crisis and reputation management specialist. Patel, by profession, is a career coach, board adviser and leadership trainer. The two of them have voluntarily stepped in to help Viswash’s family. They claim both Air India and the British govt have failed Viswash. They claim the compensation offered is nowhere near enough given his complex needs.Viswash has almost no income now. To make matters worse, his wife’s Universal Credit (UK welfare benefit) was stopped because she travelled to India for two months after the crash. Universal Credit is a UK govt-funded benefit for working-age people on a low income or unemployed. It is paid as a single monthly payment.Asked about the stoppage of his wife’s payments, a UK govt spokesperson said, “People travelling abroad due to a bereavement can continue receiving Universal Credit for up to two months, rather than the standard one-month limit. Those who are abroad for longer periods would not be able to continue receiving the benefit. People can make a new claim once they return to the UK.”Viswash says, “£21,000 is nothing. I stay in the UK. I pay mortgage….”“Before, it was different — my life was going very smoothly and nice. Now, it’s completely ruined. I feel I have changed. After this plane crash, I am not meeting many people, not talking. I just stay in my room alone,” says Viswash.Even though he came back to the UK to spend time with his wife and son, he admits, “I am not spending much time with him.”“Viswash is still suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder,” says Patel. “He is doing these interviews very reluctantly. He had some treatment in India, but the NHS is not geared up for expedited care. The whole family is traumatised. We have interacted with Air India to say we need to talk about this so they get to understand their circumstances and they have not been willing to have that conversation. The situation is desperate. ”Seiger says, “This is the sole survivor of a major aviation disaster. If ever there was a case for the (Air India) CEO to come and meet personally with the sole survivor, this is it. We have issued that invite to the CEO via our solicitors to their lawyers three times and got nowhere.”","Vishwashkumar ramesh, 39, was the lone survivor of the ai-171 crash in june. His brother ajaykumar, who was in seat 11j, was among the 241 who died. Viswash is now in leicester, uk, but has not yet seen any doctor in the nhs nor received any psychiatric treatment or counselling.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125051868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-25314,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
