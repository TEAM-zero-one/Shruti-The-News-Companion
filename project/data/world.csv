Why India's Oscar entry matters in the age of amnesia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-oscar-entry-matters-in-the-age-of-amnesia/articleshow/124189613.cms,"The premiere of Neeraj Ghaywan 's 'Homebound' felt like being inside an Instagram scroll. The film had just been selected as India's national submission to the Academy Awards. After its shiny world premiere at Cannes, it was being screened for guests in Juhu. People had turned out. It was hard to keep your eyes from resting too long on all of the very familiar, very-online faces.Two hours later, that feeling had changed into something like its reverse. The opposite of the content scroll - the ever-advancing feed of new information and images - is the act of pausing to remember.There are plenty of reasons 'Homebound' is so interesting. Many of them I'd known in advance: its origins in a news photo from 2020, and a later piece of reportage about that photo; that it came to be produced by Karan Johar, the poster-boy of louche Bollywood glamour and big-city liberalism, who put a cast of dewy young stars to work at portraying the hard lives of working-class India. That it somehow squeezed through the Censor Board, with only some forced cuts, to become India's official entry to the Oscars.The film is affecting, though, not because of its blockbuster treatment, but because it simply remembers - and lets us remember - in a way that feels increasingly rare. Its story first appeared in the form of a news photograph in May of 2020, in the middle of India's first pandemic lockdown. By the side of the highway, a man cradles his friend's head in his lap.The friend is sick, lying unconscious on the bare ground, and the young man is visibly bewildered. The two men, both in their early twenties, were Mohammad Saiyub and Amrit Kumar, one a Muslim and the other a Dalit Hindu.The image of their tender, stricken situation went viral. It was an intimate view of what many of us were watching from an emotional distance; the huge, forced exodus of working-class Indians out of cities, where their workplaces had been shuttered, onto the highways to try and find a way home. It drove home the private crises taking place within the masses of people on the move. It was also a rebuke to the script of Hindu-Muslim conflict that ran on endless repeat in the Indian media (which had already tried to report the pandemic's outbreak as a conspiracy: ""Corona Jihad"").Those bewildering early weeks of Covid, and the mass-exodus of Indians from urban centers, seemed like events we would never forget. Many events inthose years felt that way. Among privileged Indians, though, the memory of lockdown has dwindled into hazy, private reminiscences: about sleeping in late, and listening to podcasts while you swept your own floors.Covid as a national event - a collective crisis we all witnessed or experienced in one way or another - seems suppressed from collective memory. In March and April of 2022, for instance, we had experienced a near-unravelling of society during the second wave: people falling sick, with no route left to a hospital bed or any medical care. For a period, there was no way to meet a specialist, no way to fill a prescription, no oxygen to bring home; there were only dozens of hopeless phone numbers and registries. It was a traumatic event on a national scale.Yet this summer, the five-year anniversary of the first lockdown passed by us in eerie silence, without remark or remembrance. 'Homebound', arriving now, at the end of monsoon, is like a rush of oxygen to the brain. The act of remembering feels like an exceptional - in the sense of rare - phenomenon in our present lives. The twin engines of social media and 24x7 news drive our attention continuously to the present and the new. Breaking news used to reach us once or twice a day, in the morning paper or evening broadcast; now it arrives every minute of the day.As an asset to a democratic society, breaking news is highly overrated. It serves very little purpose to have news and information come at us without pause; without time to understand it, or even to properly feel anything about it. What is underrated is the opposite of breaking news: memory. But it's so hard to sustain a thought nowadays. How do we sustain our interest in what mattered to us five years, five hours ago or even five minutes ago? We're too busy being informed about everything to care about anything.Technology and media manufacture amnesia about even the largest, most destabilising events we've lived through together. They suppress collective memory, as if by design. Instead, we argue viciously about history and the ancient past. The political crises of 500 years ago are dragged into our view again and again, while the crises of five years disappear. The courage to reverse that is radical, even when it's hidden behind the bright lights of a big premiere.Karnad is an award-winning author","Neeraj ghaywan's 'homebound' was selected as india's national submission to the academy awards.

Russian FM Lavrov Hails Stronger India-Russia Ties, Putin’s Visit To India Confirmed By Year-End

At the recent 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that plans are underway for President Putin to visit New Delhi in December.As per news agency ANI, he remarked, “In December, a visit from Mr Putin is being planned to New Delhi,” highlighting the significant bilateral agenda that includes trade, military cooperation, technological exchange, finance, humanitarian efforts, healthcare, and advancements in high-tech sectors such as artificial intelligence.Lavrov also expressed confidence in India’s ability to independently navigate its trade relations, stating, “India is perfectly capable of making their own decisions in its trade relations with Russia.”Reflecting on recent discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, he added, “This year, my colleague, I spoke to him yesterday, will visit Russia, and I will visit India. We hold regular exchanges.”He also praised Jaishankar's diplomatic stance, which asserts India’s autonomy in deciding its energy partnerships.In regard to the US imposing sanctions on India for purchasing Russian oil, Lavrov firmly stated that the economic partnership between India and Russia is “not under threat,” reaffirming that India selects its own international partners.As per ANI, he noted, “If the US has proposals on how to enrich bilateral trade between the US and India, they are prepared to discuss the terms for that.”He also pointed out that India’s relationships with third states are matters to be decided independently, reflecting a broader sentiment of national pride.Moreover, Lavrov underscored the longstanding strategic partnership between India and Russia, which has been further upgraded to a “particularly privileged strategic partnership.”He stressed that the relationship extends beyond the influence of US-India dynamics and highlighted recent high-level meetings, including the recent gathering of Prime Minister Modi and President Putin at the SCO summit in China.Lavrov also reiterated Russia’s endorsement of India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ).According to ANI, he stated, “Russia supports the application of Brazil and India for permanent seats” on the Council, emphasising the need for reform to reflect the current global landscape. Lavrov’s remarks come as Mauritius and Bhutan have also voiced their support for India's UNSC aspirations, aligning with the growing demand for a more representative Council.He pointed out the differences that have emerged in the global balance since the UN's formation 80 years ago, advocating for adjustments that will make the UNSC more effective and inclusive. This sentiment is echoed in discussions around the need for collective representation from regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America in international forums.These developments coincide with a broader call for UNSC reform, as outlined in joint statements from BRICS meetings that seek to create a Council that is “more democratic, representative, effective and efficient,” reflecting the voices of developing nations.","Russian fm lavrov hails stronger india-russia ties, putin’s visit to india confirmed by year-end.

Army issues tender for highly mobile air defence system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-issues-tender-for-highly-mobile-air-defence-system/articleshow/124188088.cms,"Indian Air Force Decommissions MiG-21 Jets After 60 Years In Grand Ceremony At Chandigarh Base

QRSAM offers 360° radar, jamming shield, mobile launchers

NEW DELHI: India kicked off the acquisition process for three highly mobile regiments of indigenous quick reaction surface-to-air missile (QRSAM) systems that can detect and destroy aircraft, attack helicopters, drones, rockets and missiles at ranges of over 30km, at a cost of about Rs 30,000 crore.The Army this week issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named “Anant Shastra”, which has been developed by DRDO and will be co-produced by defence PSUs Bharat Electronics and Bharat Dynamics.The move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor. The Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such QRSAM regiments in the long term, each with nine firing units, while the IAF at present is looking to induct three QRSAM squadrons, as was first reported by TOI.With missile launchers, 360-degree radars, automated command and control systems and all-weather tracking systems mounted on high-mobility 8x8 vehicles, the QRSAM systems are designed to provide air defence cover to tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns.""With their 'search, track and fire at short halt' capabilities, the QRSAM systems will be able to operate on the move with mechanised columns across plains, deserts and mountains both on the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) fronts.They will give protection not only against enemy aircraft but also new-age threats like swarm drones and loitering munitions,"" an officer said.The QRSAM systems, with a 30-km interception range to neutralise incoming threats at altitudes of 6 to 10km, are also designed to resist electronic jamming to ensure accuracy even under hostile conditions.""With pre-fragmented warheads, high-speed solid fuel propulsion and network integration with the Army's Akashteer command & control network, the Anant Shastra will be a tactical game-changer. It will replace old systems such as the Russian-origin OSA-AK to give the Army a faster, smarter and more mobile shield,"" another officer said.Once inducted, the QRSAM systems will add to the country's existing multi-layered air defence network of foreign and indigenous systems, which played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the conflict.In addition to its existing Akash surface-to-air missiles, which have a 25-km interception range, the AAD is also inducting two new Akash Prime regiments designed for air defence in high-altitude areas above 4,500-metre along the frontier with China under a Rs 8,160 crore contract in March 2023.The AAD, which currently has 55 regiments of different weapon systems, is also going in for “smart and programmable ammunition” for its old L-70 anti-aircraft guns and ZU-23mm twin-barrel cannons, which incidentally performed well during Operation Sindoor.“Parallelly, quickly-deployable counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) guns, with a high rate of fire, as well as successors to L-70 and ZU-23 guns will be required. Counter-RAM (rocket, artillery and mortar) capability similar to the Phalanx close-in weapon systems of the US will also be needed,” a third officer said.The AAD will also have to go in for a major upgrade in its radars and sensors guiding the air defence guns. At present, they are geared to detect larger targets like aircraft instead of smaller ones like drones.",The army this week issued the tender or rfp (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named ‘anant shastra’ the move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with pakistan from may 7 to 10 under operation sindoor.

Poll What action do you think should be taken against countries that sponsor terrorism? International sanctions Diplomatic dialogue

This is same Pak that shielded terror outfit at UNSC: India representative

Without naming any country, India's foreign minister S Jaishankar warned the United Nations on Saturday that ""those who condone nations that sponsor terror will find it comes back to bite them"".In his address before the UN General Assembly, Jaishankar implicitly took aim at Pakistan, calling it an epicentre of global terrorism and pointing out that for decades, major international terrorist attacks are traced back to that one country and UN lists of terrorists are replete with its nationals.The most recent example of its cross-border barbarism was the murder of innocent tourists in Pahalgam earlier this year, following which, he said, India ""exercised its right to defend its people and brought its organisers and perpetrators to justice"". Since terrorism is a shared threat, he called for much deeper international cooperation.""When nations openly declare terrorism a state policy, when terror hubs operate on an industrial scale, when terrorists are publicly glorified, then such actions must be unequivocally condemned,"" he told the UN body.Earlier on Friday, India lampooned Pakistan's claim that it had won the recent conflict with India, telling the UN that ""if destroyed runways and burnt-out hangars look like victory...Pakistan is welcome to enjoy it"".New Delhi asserted that it was Pakistani military that ""pleaded with us directly for a cessation to the fighting"", and if Islamabad is sincere about peace, it must ""immediately shut down all terrorist camps and handover to us terrorists wanted in India"". In a sharp riposte to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif's ""absurd theatrics"", which included pretensions of seeking peace and presenting the country as a bulwark of terrorism in his speech, India's first secretary Petal Gahlot reminded the UN that Pakistan sheltered Osama bin Laden for a decade even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism.As is customary in recent years, India fielded a junior diplomat to lance Pakistan's claims as the two countries resumed their war of words at UN. ""A country long steeped in the tradition of deploying and exporting terrorism has no shame in advancing the most ludicrous narratives to that end,"" Gahlot said while exercising New Delhi's right to reply to Pakistan PM's speech.Gahlot also reminded the UN that ""this is the very same Pakistan which, at the UNSC, shielded 'The Resistance Front',"" a Pakistan-sponsored terror outfit that carried out the Pahalgam massacre where Hindus were identified by their religion and butchered. The carnage led to India's retaliatory strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan. ""The truth is that as in the past, Pakistan is responsible for a terrorist attack on innocent civilians in India. We have exercised the right to defend our people against such actions and have brought the organisers and perpetrators to justice,"" Gahlot said.The Indian diplomat also asserted New Delhi's ""longstanding national position"" that there is no room for any third party in mediating outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, rejecting Islamabad's effort to draw the US and other nations into the dispute. After claims by US President Trump that he brought about a truce between the two sides during the recent war and his tentative efforts to mediate, Washington has now reverted to its position that matters need to be resolved bilaterally.Earlier, Sharif pleaded in his speech that Pakistan's ""sacrifices"" as a ""bulwark against terrorism"" must be respected and appreciated because ""had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming in the streets of New York, London, and the Far East"", unwittingly reminding the UN that Pakistan terrorists are indeed doing so.Aside from Ramzi Yousef, Khalid Shaikh Mohd and Osama bin Laden, who were responsible for the two WTC bombings in 1993 and 2001, and who sheltered in Pakistan, Faisal Shahzad, son of a Pakistani air vice-marshal, was convicted of the 2010 Times Square car bombing a few blocks from the UN. Pakistanis and Pakistani-origin terrorists also carried out massacres from San Bernardino, California, to London, to Mumbai, a record its patrons have glossed over.Gahlot, a popular diplomat who is also an accomplished singer, lit into Pakistan in a brief retort that mocked Pakistan PM Sharif's reference to ""Hindutva-based extremism"", saying it is ""ironic that a country which wallows in hate, bigotry and intolerance should preach to this assembly on matters of faith"".Gahlot also asserted that where terrorism is concerned, India is ""making it clear that there will be no distinction between the terrorists and their sponsors. Both will be held accountable."" Nor will New Delhi allow terrorism to be practised under the cover of nuclear blackmail, she said.","India's foreign minister s jaishankar warned the united nations on saturday that ""those who condone nations that sponsor terror will find it comes back to bite them"" he implicitly took aim at pakistan, calling it an epicentre of global terrorism and pointing out that for decades, major international terrorist attacks are traced back to that country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124187363,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-754350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Russia at UNGA: Foreign minister Lavrov pushes for permanent seat for India in UNSC - Top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-at-unga-foreign-minister-lavrov-pushes-for-permanent-seat-for-india-in-unsc-ukraine-top-quote/articleshow/124184637.cms,"Here are the top quotes from his address.

The global majority is loudly asserting its rights. The Shanghai Corporation Organization and the Brics play a special role as mechanisms for coordinating the interests of the global south and east.

These new realities are not being adequately reflected in our organizational framework.

The issue of security council's reform is particularly important. Russia calls for its democratisation exclusively through the expansion of representation from Asia, Africa and Latin America. We support the application of Brazil and India permanent seats on the council.

Russia is being accused of almost planning to attack the North Atlantic alliance and the European Union countries.

Russia has never had and does not have any such intentions. However, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response.

Russia firmly condemned the attack by Hamas militants on Israeli civilians on October 07, 2023. However, there is no justification for the brutal killings of the civilian population of Palestine or for terrorist attacks. There is also no justification for the collective punishment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Palestinian children are dying from bombing and starvation. Hospitals and schools are being destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people are being left without shelter. There is no justification for plans to annex the West Bank.

The rejection of a Russian bid to extend the deadline finally exposed the West's policy of sabotaging the pursuit of constructive solutions in the UN Security Council, as well as its desire to extract unilateral concessions from Tehran through blackmail and pressure.

As President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly emphasised, Russia has been and remains open to negotiations on eliminating the root causes of the conflict. Russia's security and its vital interest must be reliably agreed. The rights of Russians and Russian-speaking people in the territories that remain under control of the Kyiv regime must be restored in full. On this basis, we are ready to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.

NEW DELHI: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday advocated for a permanent seat for India in the United Nations Security council Lavrov, while addressing the UNGA annual summit, said that the current balance of the world is radically different from 80 years ago when UN was established.","Russian foreign minister sergey lavrov advocated for a permanent seat for india in the united nations security council.

Terror hubs operate in industrial scale, terrorists are publicly glorified, financing of terror must be choked.

The most recent example of cross-border barbarism was the murder of innocent tourists in Pahalgam in April this year. India exercised its right to defend its people against terrorism and brought its organisers and perpetrators to justice. Because terrorism is a shared threat, it is essential that there is much deeper international cooperation.

When nations openly declare terrorism a state policy, when terror hubs operate on an industrial scale, when terrorists are publicly glorified, then such actions must be unequivocally condemned. The financing of terrorism must be choked even as prominent terrorists are sanctioned. Relentless pressure must be applied on the entire terrorism ecosystem.

Those who condone nations that sponsor terror will find that it comes back to bite them.

An objective report card will show that the UN is in a state of crisis. When peace is under threat from conflicts, when development is derailed by lack of resources, when human rights are violated by terrorism, the UN remains gridlocked. As its ability to forge common ground diminishes, belief in multilateralism also recedes.

Both permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council must be expanded. A reformed Council must be truly representative. India stands ready to assume greater responsibilities.

Turbulent times require that we step forward during moments of crisis. India has been forthcoming in that regard, especially in its immediate vicinity. Whether it is finance, food, fertilizer or fuel, we have responded to the urgent requirements of our neighbours.

The people of Afghanistan and those of Myanmar saw India extend its hand during recent earthquakes. Our efforts at ensuring safe commerce, combating piracy and preventing attacks on shipping in the northern Arabian Sea also bear mention our soldiers ensure peacekeeping, our sailors protect maritime shipping, our security counters terrorism, our doctors and teachers facilitate human development the world over, our industry produces affordable products, our techies promote digitization and our training facilities are open to the world. These remain the core of our foreign policy.

Bharat will always maintain its freedom of choice & will be voice of global south.

In the case of conflicts, especially Ukraine and Gaza, even those not directly involved have felt its impact. Nations who can engage all sides must step-up in the search for solutions. India calls for an end to hostilities and will support any initiative that will help restore peace.

India remains committed to sharing its experiences and tools with others on their journey of development. Artificial Intelligence as a horizontal and cross-cutting technology has a particular promise for development.

India’s approach is to harness it responsibly for human welfare. Inclusion and impact will be the watch words for the Summit that India will host in 2026.

Bharat approaches the contemporary world, guided by three key concepts. One, Atmanirbharta or self-reliance...Two, Atmaraksha or securing oneself. We remain determined to protect our people and secure their interests, at home and abroad. That means zero-tolerance for terrorism, robust defence of our borders, forging partnerships beyond and assisting our community abroad. And three, Atmavishwas or self-confidence... Bharat will always maintain its freedom of choice. And will always be a voice of the Global South.



These are certainly challenging times for the international community. Many of our assumptions and expectations no longer hold. In such circumstances, it is imperative to stay strong, to hold firm and to deepen friendships.

International cooperation must prevail because islands of prosperity cannot flourish in an ocean of turbulence. A world order requires common purpose, as it does empathy for others. That is where we look to the United Nations.

Every member who can make this world a better place must have the opportunity to do their utmost. And for that to happen, reformed multilateralism is the obvious way. The ninth decade of the UN must be one of leadership and hope.

: India on Friday lampooned Pakistan’s claim that it had won the recent brief war with India, telling the United Nations that “If destroyed runways and burnt-out hangers look like victory…Pakistan is welcome to enjoy it.”New Delhi also asserted that it was the Pakistani military that “pleaded with us directly for a cessation to the fighting” and if Islamabad is sincere about wanting peace, it must “immediately shut down all terrorist camps and handover to us terrorists wanted in India.”In a sharply-worded riposte to Pakistan Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s “absurd theatrics “ that included pretensions of seeking peace and presenting the country as a bulwark of terrorism in his speech, India reminded the UN that Pakistan sheltered Osama bin Laden for a decade, even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism.“A country long steeped in the tradition of deploying and exporting terrorism has no shame in advancing the most ludicrous narratives to that end,” India’s First Secretary Petal Gahlot said while exercising New Delhi’s right to reply to the Pakistan PMs speech.Gahlot also reminded the UN that “this is the very same Pakistan which, at the UN Security Council shielded ‘ The Resistance Front ’,” a Pakistani sponsored terror outfit that carried out the Pahalgam massacre where Hindus were identified by their religion and butchered.The carnage led to India’s retaliatory strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan.“The truth is that as in the past, Pakistan is responsible for a terrorist attack on innocent civilians in India. We have exercised the right to defend our people against such actions and have brought the organizers and perpetrators to justice,” Gahlot said.The Indian diplomat also asserted New Delhi’s “longstanding national position” that there is no room for any third party in mediating outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, rejecting Islamabad’s effort to draw the US and other countries into the dispute.After claims by US President Donald Trump that he brought about a truce between the two sides during the recent war and his tentative efforts to mediate, Washington has now reverted to its position that matters need to be resolved bilaterally.Earlier, Sharif pleaded in his speech that Pakistan’s “sacrifices” as a ""bulwark against terrorism"" must be respected and appreciated because “had these terrorists not been encountered by us, they would have been roaming in the streets of New York, London, and Far East,” unwittingly reminding the UN that Pakistan terrorists are indeed doing so.Aside from Ramzi Yousef, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Osama bin Laden, who were responsible for the two World Trade Center bombings in 1993 and 2001, and who sheltered in Pakistan, Faisal Shahzad, son of a Pakistani Air Vice Marshal, was convicted for the 2010 Times Square car bombing a few blocks from the UN. Pakistanis and Pakistani-origin terrorists also carried out massacres from San Bernardino, California, to London, to Mumbai, a record its patrons have glossed over.As is customary in recent years, India fielded a junior diplomat to lance Pakistan’s claims as the two countries resumed their war of words at the UN. Gahlot, a popular diplomat who is also an accomplished singer, lit into Pakistan in a brief retort that mocked Sharif reference to “Hindutva-based extremism” saying it is “ironic that a country which wallows in hate, bigotry and intolerance should preach to this Assembly on matters of faith. ” Pakistan officially and constitutionally discriminates against minorities, including Muslim minorities such as Ahmadis.Gahlot also asserted that where terrorism is concerned, India is “making it clear that there will be no distinction between the terrorists and their sponsors. Both will be held accountable.” Nor will New Delhi allow terrorism to be practised under the cover of nuclear blackmail.","India lampooned pakistan’s claim that it had won the recent brief war with india, telling the united nations that “if destroyed runways and burnt-out hangers look like victory…pakistan is welcome to enjoy it” india reminded the un that pakistan sheltered osama bin laden for a decade, even while pretending to partner in the war against terrorism.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124183459,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-725334,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

""Understandably, we have different histories, traditions, heritage and culture. For them to co-exist, for them to enrich each other, it is imperative that we foster understanding and respect.

Ladakhi Sonam Wangchuk , said to be the inspiration behind the endearing character essayed by Aamir Khan, has since gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.Wangchuk, variously described as an innovator, activist and climate warrior, did not stumble into politics overnight.Four months after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, he released a video thanking PM Narendra Modi for making Ladakh a Union territory, albeit with a veiled warning. ""People here have started asking whether UT status was granted to exploit Ladakh's vast resources, and whether our resources will be exploited the way China does in Tibet,"" Wangchuk said, urging the Centre to safeguard the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.In January 2023, he announced a five-day climate fast at Khardung La, one of the world's highest passes, where winter temperatures plunge to minus 40 degrees Celsius. The administration prevented him from reaching the site, forcing him to pitch tent in Leh instead. The protest, complete with political speeches, music, solidarity gatherings and anti-establishment rap, galvanised Wangchuk's mission.A year later, in October 2024, he ended another 16-day fast only after the Union home ministry agreed to resume talks with Ladakhi organisations.After negotiations stalled, he launched a new 35-day hunger strike on Sept 10 this year, demanding statehood for Ladakh with Sixth Schedule safeguards. ""It's possible that we might die. If we survive, we will return for another hunger strike of six weeks,"" he declared.Last Wednesday, he called off the fast after violent protests erupted across the region, leaving four dead and dozens injured.Born in 1966 in a village near Leh, Wangchuk had been homeschooled until he was nine. In 1975, after his father Sonam Wangyal became a minister in the then J&K govt, the family moved to Srinagar. He later studied engineering at NIT Srinagar and got another degree from CRATerre School of Architecture in Grenoble, France.In 1988, Wangchuk co-founded the Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh to reform the education system. He argued that Ladakhi children, struggling with textbooks designed for other regions, were being unfairly labelled poor performers.Wangchuk's activism and political discourse in Ladakh now run parallel. The roots of the present turmoil lie in the 2020 Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council polls, when most political parties called for a poll boycott until Sixth Schedule protection was granted.By 2021, the Leh Apex Body and the Kargil Democratic Alliance emerged, uniting religious and political groups to demand safeguards for Ladakh's indigenous people. Though Wangchuk acted independently, both organisations supported his campaign.","Ladakhi sonam wangchuk has gained a reputation more as a political provocateur than a proponent of philosophical life hacks.

Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union , has built a pretty successful career for herself in Hollywood, even though she has gone through a lot of traumatic experiences while doing so. A few hours ago, Gabrielle Union reunited with her “Bring It On” cast to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary. While Gabrielle Union looked excited at the event, she had opened up about the reason behind working on the movie and being rejected by another movie for her ethnicity.A few months ago, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, revealed that 25 years ago, she was actually aiming for another movie.Gabrielle Union said, ""The cheerleading movie I wanted about bank robbing [Sugar and Spice]...”The popular actress added, “They didn't want to go Black on any of the characters…So it's interesting, the group that didn't want to commit to diversity didn't seem to do well and the movie that was about righting the wrongs did well, and that included diversity.""This is not the first time that Gabrielle Union opened up about the discrimination that African American actors have faced while working in Holywood.In March 2025, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, made an appearance on Apple TV+'s new series, Number One on the Call Sheet, where she revealed the discrimination she has faced in Hollywood.Gabrielle Union said, “When you have a more coarse grade of hair, when you have melanin, thicker nose, wider nose, wider lips, you're not considered, you know, a classic beauty…”Despite all the traumatic experiences she has faced, the “Being Mary Jane” star has paved her own path in Hollywood and is considered to be one of the most popular and talented actresses working in the industry.While Gabrielle Union has a highly successful career in Hollywood, her marriage to Dwyane Wade has also inspired millions of fans around the world.Both Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade were separated from their former spouses when the two fell in love with one another.

Charlie Kirk’s derogatory post about Taylor Swift’s political beliefs resurfaces



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed silent about Charlie Kirk’s assassination



It’s been a few days since Charlie Kirk’s public assassination shocked fans and dragged Taylor Swift into the controversy. Political activist Charlie Kirk’s death had divided citizens but many of his derogatory posts about Taylor Swift had resurfaced. Amid the mess, another derogatory post made by Charlie Kirk targeting Taylor Swift’s political beliefs has now resurfaced.A couple of years ago, in 2018, political activist Charlie Kirk targeted Taylor Swift in a derogatory post where he also criticised her career.The post read as, “Hey @taylorswift13 You just endorsed a Democrat in the Tennessee senate race with a ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn, a woman, is against women…”Charlie Kirk added, “You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Your career has never recovered since Kanye ended it.”For the unversed, in 2018 Taylor Swift had publicly spoken against Marsha Blackburn's 2018 Senate campaign and supported her opponent.In 2020’s documentary of Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana, the pop star showed what went behind her decision of speaking against Marsha Blackburn.Taylor Swift said, “She gets to be the first female senator in Tennessee, and she’s Trump in a wig…She represents no female interests.She won by being a female applying to the kind of female males want us to be in a horrendous 1950s world.”The billionaire pop star also criticised Marsha Blackburn’s opposition to same-sex marriage and her 2013 vote against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.Taylor Swift said, “It’s really basic human rights, and it’s right and wrong at this point, and I can’t see another commercial and see her disguising these policies behind the words ‘Tennessee Christian values…”Back in 2018, Taylor Swift’s statements against Marsha Blackburn’s campaign had sparked panic as even President Donald Trump criticised the pop star.Coming back to Charlie Kirk’s post about Taylor Swift, the pop star has not commented on it even though the political activist had made many such derogatory posts about her and her career.Charlie Kirk left behind his wife, Erika Kirk, and their two young children, a daughter and a son who was just born last year, and this has been devastating for his family.
