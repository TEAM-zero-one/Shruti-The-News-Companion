"In 'clear message', Malaysia, India slam cross-border terror",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-clear-message-malaysia-india-slam-cross-border-terror/articleshow/128086616.cms,"Malaysia joined India in strongly condemning cross-border terrorism, signalling a greater understanding of India’s position on that issue, as PM Narendra Modi said after a bilateral meeting with counterpart Anwar Ibrahim that the message from both countries on terrorism was clear: no double standards, no compromise.Modi’s visit to Malaysia saw close to a dozen agreements and announcements for cooperation in areas spanning across defence and security, semiconductors, social security for Indian workers, UN peace keeping, disaster management and countering corruption.While similar joint statements issued after summit meetings in 2015, 2017 and 2024 had condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, on this occasion it also specifically mentioned cross-border terrorism, an expression that helps India flag Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The latest leaders’ joint statement also reaffirmed commitment to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation in countering terrorism, including in the UN and FATF, radicalisation and violent extremism.Also read | From semiconductors to security: Key outcomes from PM Modi’s Malaysia visit “In the field of security, we will strengthen cooperation in counter-terrorism, intelligence sharing, and maritime security. We will also further expand defence cooperation,” said Modi, thanking Ibrahim for his strong condemnation of the Pahalgam attack and the Red Fort blast.The PM underlined the significance of growing friendship between the 2 countries in the current climate of global uncertainty, saying the leaders backed all peace efforts and agreed that reform of global institutions was essential to address today’s challenges.While there was no official word from either side about whether the extradition sought by India of fugitive Zakir Naik was discussed in the meeting, official sources said India remains in touch with Malaysia to address legal issues related to its extradition request.Modi and Ibrahim also participated in a CEO Forum that, Modi said, opened new avenues for trade and investment. “Alongside AI and digital technologies, we will advance our partnership in semiconductors, health, and food security. Guided by strategic trust, we will chart a pathway towards economic transformation,” said PM Modi.Also read | ‘No double standards, no compromise’: PM Modi reiterates India’s firm stand on terrorism in Malaysia -top quotes According to the joint statement, the leaders expressed satisfaction over the robust defence relationship between Malaysia and India, underscored by “the regular exchanges, visits, staff talks, exercises, training courses and defence industry collaboration”. While there was no mention of it in the statement, India is considering sale of Dornier aircraft to Malaysia and also supply of naval platforms by Indian shipyards. “The Prime Ministers encouraged the growing maritime cooperation between India and Malaysia, including through regular goodwill and operational deployments,” said the joint statement.There was focus on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific with Modi saying India will further broaden its engagement with the southeast Asia grouping and added the leaders agreed to an early completion of the ASEAN–India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) review.“The Indo-Pacific region is emerging as the engine of global growth. We are committed, together with ASEAN, to promote development, peace, and stability across the Indo-Pacific. India places high priority on ASEAN centrality,” said Modi.Modi and Ibrahim, amidst continued tensions in South China Sea over Chinese activities, reiterated their commitment to respecting freedom of navigation and overflight, and unimpeded lawful commerce, based on the principles of international law. “The two Leaders urged all parties to resolve disputes through peaceful means in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including UNCLOS 1982,” said the joint statement.The leaders also agreed to strengthen cooperation in multilateral forums, including United Nations, and support reforms of international institutions. “They pledged to work together to enhance multilateralism, reflective of contemporary realities so as to make international organisations, including the UNSC, more representative,” said the joint statement, adding Modi deeply appreciated Malaysia’s support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed UNSC. Ibrahim backed India’s 2026 BRICS chairmanship and India’s Malaysia’s role as a BRICS Partner Country, while taking note of Malaysia’s aspiration to become a member of BRICS.Ahead of the elections in Tamil Nadu, Modi also reached out to the Tamil community in Malaysia as he said both countries were connected by a shared affection for the Tamil language and that the strong and vibrant presence of Tamil was visible in education, media, and cultural life in the country. The PM said that an audio-visual agreement signed during his visit will bring “our hearts even closer through films and music, especially Tamil cinema”. Amongst the key announcements during Modi’s visit was establishment of a dedicated Thiruvalluvar Centre in Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur and also institution of Thiruvalluvar Scholarships for Malaysian Nationals.","Malaysia joined india in strongly condemning cross-border terrorism, signalling a greater understanding of india’s position on that issue.

""The presence of youngsters in particular was gladdening to see. It shows that the people of Kerala are appreciating our vision of Vikasita Keralam.

India, Canada Agree On Security And Law Enforcement Work Plan After NSA Doval's Ottawa Visit

NEW DELHI: NSA Ajit Doval's first bilateral visit to Canada since the diplomatic strife over the killing of a Khalistani separatist in 2023 rocked the relationship between the countries saw both sides agreeing to a ""shared workplan"" to guide bilateral cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues, and to enable ""practical collaboration"" on respective priorities. Doval is learnt to have strongly conveyed to Canada that violent extremist groups should not enjoy any form of support from the Canadian govt.According to an Indian readout, both sides acknowledged progress on initiatives aimed at supporting the safety and security of their countries and citizens.The national security advisor met his counterpart Nathalie Drouin on Saturday, during a visit that the Indian govt described as part of regular bilateral security dialogue between the two sides. While there have been several high-level exchanges between the two sides in the recent past, including a visit to India by Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand, Doval's presence in Canada is being seen as an important confidence-building measure ahead of PM Mark Carney's visit to India next month.According to a ministry of external affairs (MEA) statement, it was agreed that each country would ""establish security and law enforcement liaison officers and that their respective agencies would build on working relationships"".""This important step will help streamline bilateral communication and enable timely information sharing on issues of mutual concern to Canada and India, such as the illegal flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl precursors, and transnational organised criminal networks,"" said the statement.During her visit, Anand had told TOI that Canada is following a twin-track approach to India: active law enforcement dialogue to address security concerns and expanded cooperation in trade, technology and energy. The visit also saw both sides launching a new roadmap to revive economic ties amidst increasing global uncertainties.Both sides also committed to formalising cooperation on cybersecurity policy and information sharing on cybersecurity issues, as well as continuing talks on cooperation over fraud and immigration enforcement, consistent with domestic laws and international obligations, according to the readout. Doval also had a meeting with Gary Anandasangaree, the Canadian minister for public safety, on Friday.","India, canada agree on security and law enforcement work plan.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to Japan’s House of Representatives, expressing confidence that bilateral ties between India and Japan would further deepen under her leadership.Congratulating her on the outcome, PM Modi underlined the importance of India–Japan ties, which are anchored in a Special Strategic and Global Partnership and play a key role in regional and global stability.In a post on X, he wrote, “Congratulations Sanae Takaichi on your landmark victory in the elections to the House of Representatives. Our Special Strategic and Global Partnership plays a vital role in enhancing global peace, stability and prosperity. I am confident that under your able leadership, we will continue to take the India-Japan friendship to greater heights.”Takaichi secured a sweeping mandate in the snap lower house elections, consolidating her position just months after becoming Japan’s first woman prime minister. Her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), along with coalition partners is expected to command a strong two-thirds majority, giving her government a decisive edge to push its legislative agenda.Takaichi, 64, emerged as Japan’s prime minister in October after winning the leadership of the LDP, becoming the country’s first woman to hold the office.Known for her tough stance on defence, economic security and China, she has positioned herself as a strong advocate of closer cooperation with the United States and like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region.Her victory marks a turnaround for the LDP after years of political turbulence marked by inflation, funding scandals and voter discontent.The decisive mandate is expected to give Takaichi greater authority to pursue policy reforms, including increased defence spending, economic stimulus measures and a more assertive foreign policy.","Pm narendra modi congratulated japanese prime minister sanae takaichi on her landmark victory in the elections to japan’s house of representatives.

‘Have To Stay United’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat On Atrocities Against Hindus In Bangladesh

RSS chief must be Hindu, caste not a criterion

Organisation focuses on values, not campaigning

Language and anti-corruption stance

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the organisation had asked him to continue working despite completing 75 years of age, adding that he would step down whenever the Sangh directs him to do so.Speaking during an interactive session at an event marking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s centenary, Bhagwat said there is no election for the post of RSS chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.“There is no election to the post of RSS chief. Regional and divisional heads appoint the chief. Generally, it is said that after turning 75, one should work without holding any post,” Bhagwat said.He added that after informing the organisation about turning 75, he was asked to continue.“I have completed 75 years and informed the RSS, but the organisation asked me to continue working. Whenever the RSS asks me to step down, I will do so, but retirement from work will never happen,” he said.Bhagwat said the RSS does not follow community-based representation and that volunteers rise through the ranks based on their work. He asserted that the RSS chief will always be a Hindu, irrespective of caste and the post goes to the best available candidate.“If I were to choose a chief, I would go by the ‘best available candidate’ criterion,” he said, adding that belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe communities is not a disqualification, just as being a Brahmin is not a qualification.The RSS chief said the organisation’s work was about inculcating “sanskar” or values, and not campaigning.“Excessive campaigning leads to publicity and then arrogance,” he said, adding that publicity should be measured and timely.In a lighter remark, Bhagwat said the Sangh “extracts work till the last drop of blood from its volunteer” and that there has never been a situation where someone had to be retired.Bhagwat said English would never be the medium of communication for RSS functioning as it is not an Indian language, though it is used where necessary.He also said the RSS works geographically and does not target any caste or community.On corruption, Bhagwat said the RSS supports anyone fighting it. “Our volunteers are told to support those who fight corruption,” he said, adding that corruption lies in people’s minds, not the system.He also urged people to detect and report illegal infiltrators to authorities and said caste-based reservations should continue “as long as needed,” while stressing the need for social unity.","Mohan bhagwat says there is no election for the post of rss chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.

Nayara's future unsure: India may bargain with US for Russian crude,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nayaras-future-unsure-india-may-bargain-with-us-for-russian-crude/articleshow/128084437.cms,"NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if India does not stop buying Russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of Nayara refinery in Jamnagar.The crisis facing the refinery has triggered talks about change of ownership. While the refinery, under normal circumstances, would qualify to be a good buy, US's hardline stance may prove to be a dampener for prospective buyers, something which is going to persist unless there is a dramatic breakthrough in the talks to get Russia to pause its aggression against Ukraine.Rosneft - Russia's state-run energy giant that has been sanctioned by the Trump administration in order to pressure Vladimir Putin into agreeing to pause his offensive against Ukraine - owns majority stake in the 20 million metric tonnes per annum refinery. Located at Vadinar (Gujarat), Nayara, the country's second-largest single-site refinery, specialises in processing heavy crude. Until the US sanctions were imposed, it was almost entirely dependent on Russian crude as feedstock.Analysts said with the immediate future of the refinery in mind, India may continue negotiating with the Trump administration to allow import of smaller volumes of Russian crude.Indian refineries have been cutting down on purchase of Russian crude.Though observers said India cannot immediately halt purchases even if it decides to reduce dependence on Urals as refiners have already booked Russian cargoes for the next eight to 10 weeks and cancelling them is not feasible, it does not remove the uncertainty about the fate of Nayara.""My sense is that India will still bargain with the US to import some amount of oil from Russia, especially for Nayara refinery,"" said Prashant Vasisht, senior V-P at ratings agency ICRA.Energy expert Narendra Taneja said India will continue importing oil from Russia too, though volumes would decline. ""India will continue to get oil supplies from Russia for two reasons - to assert its strategic autonomy and to maintain the right optics for domestic political consumption,"" he said.""Since India has to make purchases of $500 billion from the US over a period of five years - imports of oil, gas and LPG are the best way to clock the numbers up quickly, which overall is not a bad idea since what we are going to back in return (capital, technology and bigger access to American markets) is quite attractive,"" he said.India imports almost one-third of its crude from Russia, and purchases fell to $2.7 billion in Dec 2025 - the lowest monthly value of shipments in the last three years - and nearly 27% lower than the $3.7 billion recorded in Nov, according to commerce department data.Despite the decline, Russia remained the largest crude supplier to India in 2025-26, accounting for 31.5% of purchases worth $105.1 billion during April-Dec.","Us president donald trump's threat to bring back the 25% ""penalty"" if india does not stop buying russian crude has deepened the question mark on the operations of nayara refinery in jamnagar.

Congress hits back

Political backdrop

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday escalated his attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, alleging a ""deeper connection"" between Gogoi, his British wife Elizabeth Colburn and Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, and hinting at possible charges of ""rashtra-droh"" (treason) if the Congress leader failed to clarify his past visit to Pakistan.Addressing a press conference ahead of the assembly elections, Sarma claimed that Gogoi had undertaken a ""very confidential visit"" to Pakistan in December 2013 and was believed to have undergone “some kind of training” during his 10-day stay.“He stayed there for 10 days. Strangely, Gogoi was digitally silent and no social media post was made. We suspect he went through some kind of training in that period,” the chief minister said.Sarma further alleged that after returning from Pakistan and later becoming an MP, Gogoi asked questions in the Lok Sabha on military preparedness, security matters, defence hardware, nuclear plants, espionage and the Kashmir conflict. “A first-time MP asking such confidential questions, how can it not be linked to his Pakistan visit?” he asked.“If Gogoi cannot come out clean on his Pakistan stay, then charges of 'rashtra-droh' (treason) will have to be imposed on him,” Sarma added.The chief minister also alleged that Colburn had worked with LEAD Pakistan, an organisation run by Sheikh, before moving to India, and that her salary continued to be paid by Sheikh even while she was working in the country. “But her salary continued to be paid by Sheikh,” Sarma said.He claimed that LEAD Pakistan sent money to LEAD India, which then paid Colburn “bypassing FCRA regulations”, and suggested that special permission might have been obtained during the UPA government’s tenure. “Pakistani agencies cannot donate to an Indian entity as it's an enemy nation. Probably special permission was obtained in UPA time to pay Colburn,” he said.Sarma also alleged that Colburn gathered information from Intelligence Bureau sources related to climate action after Narendra Modi came to power and sent a “45-page report” to Sheikh. “Colburn got information from IB sources about climate action after Narendra Modi came to power. She sent a 45-page report to Sheikh,” he claimed.The chief minister asserted that Colburn had travelled to Islamabad six times while working with LEAD India and three more times after joining another NGO. He further alleged that she maintained a Pakistani bank account to receive salary payments and that Gogoi did not mention this in his election affidavit. “Now, I feel his opponent should complain to the EC about giving wrong information in the affidavit,” Sarma said.Sarma said the state government would seek cancellation of Colburn’s Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status, claiming her presence was detrimental to India.“We believe there is a deeper connection between Gogoi, Colburn and Sheikh. We believe that Colburn and Sheikh were part of an international conspiracy,” Sarma said.He added that the Assam Police had recommended a national-level probe by the ministry of home affairs, stating, “So we recommended a national probe by the Ministry of Home Affairs.”Gogoi, who is also the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee chief, dismissed the press conference as politically motivated.“I pity the journalists from Delhi and Assam who had to suffer the most flop press conference of the century. This was worse than a C grade cinema,” he wrote on X while the presser was underway.He described the allegations as “Most mindless and bogus points” offered by the “so-called political shrewd” chief minister and termed the episode a “#SuperFlop”“This #SuperFlop is in contrast to our #XomoyParivartanYatra which has been a hit in uncovering the 12,000 bighas of land occupied by the Chief Minister and his family members,” Gogoi said.Earlier in the week, responding to similar allegations linking his wife to Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI, Gogoi said, “If my wife is an ISI agent of Pakistan, I am a R&AW agent of India. I don't mind if a family against whom there are various cases and several allegations, makes allegations against me. The (Assam) chief minister is making these allegations only to put away allegations against him.”Dismissing the charges as “lies and rumours”, he said, “Today, BJP doesn't have any issues to raise. They are dependent on spreading lies. I feel that people of the country are very intelligent and they can see the difference between lies and truth. Let them spread rumours, we will continue to do our work.”The faceoff comes as Assam prepares for assembly elections, with both the BJP and the Congress sharpening their campaigns. Sarma’s remarks mark a significant escalation, introducing allegations of national security, foreign funding violations and possible treason into the electoral discourse.The BJP has framed the issue as one involving potential foreign influence and FCRA violations, while the Congress has characterised the allegations as diversionary tactics aimed at deflecting attention from state-level issues and charges against the chief minister.Sarma also said the Assam Police’s Special Investigation Team did not question Gogoi directly “as he is a sitting MP. We have left it to the Centre, showing some respect to his position”.“If I arrest Gogoi now, I will be accused of doing politics before elections. Arresting is a harsh step. I feel Gogoi is the most vulnerable politician in India now, as all his movements in the 10-day stay must have been photographed and recorded in Pakistan,” he said.With the campaign intensifying, the allegations and counter-allegations have injected a sharp national security dimension into Assam’s electoral battle, setting the stage for a polarised contest in the weeks ahead.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma alleges a ""deeper connection"" between gaurav gogoi, his british wife elizabeth colburn and pakistani national ali tauqeer sheikh.

""Strategic Ties And Trade Strengthened"": PM Modi Exchanges MoUs With Malaysian PM

KUALA LUMPUR: India and Malaysia inked 11 MoUs in what was described by both Anwar Ibrahim and Narendra Modi as a “critical, strategic and vital exchange” for reinforcing the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, at Seri Perdana, the official residential complex of the Malaysian PM.Key agreements include Exchange of Notes (EoN) on semiconductors, a sector where both countries are aggressively partnering to boost the value chain, including AI and R&D. At the press briefing after the signing of the deals, an agreement between India’s NPCI International Ltd (NIPL) and Malaysia’s PayNet was announced.“It is not yet operational owing to some necessary technical alignments,” said P Kumaran, secretary, East. He added that there is also a broader project for multi-point connectivity called Project Nexus; which India, Malaysia, Singapore and a few other countries in the region are working on. This will give direct connectivity from one country to all the other countries partaking in the Nexus.On the question of a timeline for operationalising the settlement of trade in local currencies, Kumaran said, “It is a matter of priority for both sides and discussions are ongoing between the two regulatory bodies, RBI and Bank Negara.We are going to be working very actively on this in the coming few months.”On defence, the two PMs emphasised their intent to work closer and expressed satisfaction at the outcomes of the Malaysia-India Defence Cooperation Committee (MIDCOM) and its subcommittees, including the terms of reference on establishment of a Strategic Affairs Working Group (SAWG) and Su-30 Forum.Importantly, India’s three-decade experience with Su-30s and its proximity to Malaysia makes it the best country for its upgrade and maintenance. This also encompasses a broader defence industrial agenda beyond transactional procurement.Other agreements include areas like disaster management, the fight against corruption, healthcare, training in Ayurveda, anti-terrorism, UN Peacekeeping as well as the Framework Agreement on the Big Cats Alliance. The two sides have also agreed to collaborate on social security through a pact between Malaysia’s social security organisation and India’s Employees’ State Insurance Corporation.","India and malaysia inked 11 mous in what was described by both anwar ibrahim and narendra modi as a ‘critical, strategic and vital exchange’ key agreements include exchange of notes (eon) on semiconductors, a sector where both countries are aggressively partnering to boost the value chain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128080196,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-65932,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

India Can Wait Out Trump: Ajit Doval Warned Marco Rubio Against Bullying On Trade Deal, Says Report

NEW DELHI: India and Canada have agreed to formulate a ""shared work plan"" to guide cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues with a larger plan to have practical collaboration to address mutual concerns such as transnational criminal networks.The decision was taken at a meeting between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart Nathalie Drouin in Ottawa on Saturday.The move is seen as part of efforts by the two sides to normalise their relations that came under severe strain following a diplomatic row over the killing of a Khalistani separatist in 2023.NSA Doval's visit to Ottawa came as the two sides are making preparations for a likely trip to India early next month by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), sharing details of the Doval-Drouin meeting, said on Sunday that the two sides acknowledged the progress on initiatives aimed at supporting the safety and security of their countries and citizens.""They agreed to a shared work plan to guide bilateral cooperation on national security and law enforcement issues and to enable practical collaboration on respective priorities,"" it said.""During the meeting, it was agreed that each country would establish security and law-enforcement liaison officers and that their respective agencies would build on working relationships,"" the MEA said in a statement.It said this ""important step"" will help streamline bilateral communications and enable timely information sharing on issues of ""mutual concern"" such as the ""illegal flow of drugs, particularly fentanyl precursors, and transnational organized criminal networks"".""They also committed to formalising cooperation on cybersecurity policy and information sharing on cybersecurity issues, as well as continuing discussions on cooperation related to fraud and immigration enforcement, consistent with domestic laws and international obligations,"" it said.NSA Doval also had a meeting with Canada's Minister for Public Safety Gary Anandasangaree on Friday.The India-Canada relations hit rock bottom following then prime minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in 2023 of a potential Indian link to the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.India had dismissed Trudeau's accusation as ""absurd"".In October 2024, India recalled its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Ottawa attempted to link them to the Nijjar case.

Cultural change:

Institutional support:

Community building:

Policy reform:

Whenever the subject of men’s loneliness or men’s mental health comes up, the conversation almost always follows the same path. It turns into a reckoning. A reminder. Sometimes even a punishment.Men built this system.Men benefit from patriarchy.Men commit violence against women.So why should we feel sorry for them now?None of this is untrue. Patriarchy is real. Gendered violence is real. Women have borne the heaviest cost of systems created and upheld largely by men. Acknowledging male loneliness does not erase that reality.But somewhere along the way, the conversation becomes so rigid that it stops seeing men as individuals and starts treating them as a single, guilty category. And that’s where something important gets lost.Because not all men are perpetrators. Not all men are powerful. And not all men feel seen by the system they are assumed to benefit from.But what about the man who genuinely respects women, who does not subscribe to regressive ideologies, who feels no ownership over the beliefs of his ancestors, and who is trying, quietly and consistently, to do what society expects of him?These men exist in large numbers, yet they are almost entirely absent from public conversations about male loneliness.This article is about them.Loneliness, despite common misconceptions, is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy. It is a subjective emotional experience characterised by a perceived gap between desired and actual social connection. Recent discussions around a so-called “male loneliness epidemic” often reduce the issue to dating failures or sexual frustration, particularly online.However, empirical research consistently shows that male loneliness extends far beyond romantic relationships. Men can be married, employed, socially functional, and still profoundly lonely.Studies suggest that men often experience loneliness differently from women. While women tend to maintain emotionally intimate friendships and family ties throughout adulthood, men are more likely to rely on structured social contexts—such as workplaces, educational institutions, or group activities—to sustain relationships. When these structures weaken or disappear, men are less likely to replace them with emotionally open connections. As a result, loneliness can persist unnoticed, even by the men experiencing it.Crucially, research also indicates that many men do not self-identify as “lonely,” even when they exhibit psychological markers associated with chronic loneliness. This disconnect is especially pronounced in India, where cultural norms discourage emotional introspection in men and valorize endurance over expression. Counselling psychologist Dr Ishita Mukerji observed this pattern repeatedly in clinical settings: “I have seen a lot of times in therapy that, you know, many male clients of mine say that I don't know what I feel. I just know something is wrong. I try to think about it but I don't get an answer. So they really don't know, right, what and how they're feeling. This confusion is not their fault. It is the result of growing up without that emotional permission. They sometimes are numb, emotionally very numb. ”India’s cultural framework places immense emphasis on masculinity as duty. Men are socialised from an early age to internalize responsibility—towards parents, siblings, spouses, children, and society at large. Emotional needs, in contrast, are often framed as indulgent or secondary. This produces what many researchers describe as a “provider burden,” where a man’s worth is tied almost exclusively to his economic utility.Recent data underscores the scale of the problem. A study conducted by the Indian Psychiatric Society found that over 20% of Indian men report experiencing loneliness. Another study by the National Sample Survey Organization revealed that nearly 45% of Indian men feel lonely, with urban men reporting the highest levels. These numbers point to a widespread phenomenon rather than isolated individual distress.Dr Mukerji explained how deeply financial instability can destabilise a man’s sense of self:“What happens is that when a person when a man loses a job, or he's earning less, or he's if he's struggling financially, it doesn't feel like a normal life to him, it actually feels like a personal failure. And this creates deep shame, stress, anxiety, and depression as well. Married men feel the pressure most. Because it's not just they responsibility for themselves, they're carrying responsibility for their wives, children, parents, extended family. They don't allow themselves to feel or say, ""I'm tired,"" or ""I'm struggling."" So when stress keeps building, and there is no emotional outlet, some men start feeling hopeless and extremely depressed.”Sanyam Kapoor, a 28-year-old product manager, when asked whether he ever feels his value as a human being is tied to his bank balance or job title, says, “I don’t want it to be, but yeah, it sneaks in. Especially when things aren’t going great financially. It’s hard not to measure yourself that way when that’s what gets noticed first.”Urbanisation has intensified this issue. Modern Indian cities often lack communal spaces that facilitate organic social bonding. Extended families have fragmented into nuclear units, neighborhoods have grown anonymous, and work hours have expanded. In this environment, men frequently find themselves socially functional but emotionally disconnected.One of the most significant psychological constructs relevant to male loneliness is “restrictive emotionality,” a term introduced by Levant in 1995. Restrictive emotionality refers to the learned inhibition of emotional expression, particularly emotions associated with vulnerability such as sadness, fear, or loneliness. According to psychologist Agneta Fischer, emotional expression is not biologically predetermined but shaped through social learning—a process heavily influenced by gender norms.In India, boys are often taught—explicitly or implicitly—that emotional restraint is a marker of strength. Crying, expressing confusion, or admitting loneliness is frequently met with ridicule or concern about masculinity. While men and women experience emotions to similar degrees, men are more likely to redirect vulnerable emotions into socially acceptable outlets such as anger, withdrawal, or stoicism.Kapoor explained why emotional restraint often feels like self-protection rather than denial.“All the time. Not because I think weakness is bad in theory — but because once you say it out loud, you can’t take it back. People look at you differently. Sometimes they worry. Sometimes they dismiss it. Either way, the dynamic changes.”This emotional suppression has tangible consequences. Chronic stress, untreated emotional distress, and prolonged loneliness can contribute to depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and physical health problems.These numbers are not abstract. In recent years, several cases have drawn public attention to the emotional distress faced by men navigating marital conflict and prolonged isolation. In one such case, a 30-year-old executive employed with a major IT firm died by suicide at his family home in Agra. Prior to his death, he recorded a video describing an overwhelming sense of loneliness and urged greater societal awareness of men’s mental health struggles, particularly the emotional isolation men experience during personal and legal disputes.""Please, someone should talk about men. They become very lonely. If laws do not protect men, then there will be no man left to be accused..."" said Manav in his note.A 22-year-old architecture student from a private engineering college in Bengaluru died by suicide last week, allegedly due to ragging. Before taking the extreme step, the student, identified as Arun, recorded a video blaming his peers and expressing emotional distress over being spoken about behind his back.A native of Hassan, Arun was a final-year architecture student who had secured a free seat at his college owing to his academic performance. His parents, daily-wage labourers, had struggled financially to support his education. Arun was also known to be a talented portrait artist. He recorded a video message detailing his anguish, mentioning that friends had been speaking ill of him behind his back.This disparity is often misunderstood. Women are statistically more likely to experience depression, yet men are significantly more likely to die by suicide. Research suggests that this paradox is linked to differences in help-seeking behavior, emotional expression, and method lethality. Men are less likely to seek professional support and more likely to reach crisis points without intervention.A 2023 study found that suicide rates among Indian men are particularly high among married men and daily wage workers—groups traditionally assumed to be socially anchored. This challenges the assumption that marriage or employment alone protect against loneliness or mental distress.A 35-year-old man, married with one child and working at a consulting firm, chose to remain anonymous. He described his life as stable, predictable—and emotionally narrow. “I wouldn’t say I’m unhappy,” he said, “but I don’t feel connected either.” Most of his close friendships gradually faded after marriage, and although he shares a home with his spouse, he feels uneasy bringing up his stress or exhaustion. “I don’t want to burden her,” he explained. “I’m supposed to handle things.”Addressing male loneliness does not negate feminist concerns, it complements them by targeting one of patriarchy’s quieter casualties.It is important to acknowledge that patriarchy harms women disproportionately and violently. However, it is also true that patriarchy diminishes men by restricting emotional expression and reducing identity to productivity. The idea that men “deserve” loneliness because they benefit from patriarchy overlooks the fact that most men do not experience power as autonomy or choice, but as obligation.Holding individual men morally accountable for historical and structural injustices obscures the real issue: systems that socialise men into emotional isolation while offering no legitimate pathways for connection.When asked, 23-year-old journalist Pranav Shukla, what stops men from talking openly about mental health, in your experience? He said, ""I think men are conditioned not to talk about it. Society often labels them as weak when they do, which makes opening up harder. That said, things are slowly changing and more men are beginning to speak openly about mental health.""Friendships are often the first relationships we form outside our families, and they play a crucial role in emotional and social development. In theory, friendships should remain one of the most important emotional anchors throughout adulthood. In practice, however, male friendships often change shape rather than deepen.Sociologist Daniel Cox coined the term “friendship recession” to describe the steady decline in close friendships across industrialised societies. While much of this research has focused on Western contexts, similar patterns are becoming increasingly visible in India as well. Men, in particular, report having fewer close friendships over time and describe greater difficulty forming new ones after early adulthood.It is important to recognise the real value that male friendships offer while also acknowledging their limitations. Many men do not lack friends, nor do they lack affection or loyalty within those friendships. What is often missing is emotional articulation. It is not that men do not want to talk about their personal victories, their disappointments, or their insecurities; rather, many hesitate because they are unsure how such openness will be received. The unspoken rule becomes one of mutual distraction—spending time together, sharing experiences, and silently hoping that presence alone will be enough.This dynamic is reflected in the experience of Ansh Srivastava, a 22-year-old software developer working in Gurgaon. ""I always have a fair guess of what’s going on in my closest friends' lives but never the whole picture. The whole point of male friendships is to spend time together through the lowest and not talk about it and feel better by the presence of their friend. I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation about my mental health or my friends’ mental health ever, it's always external events, even though he is literally a part of my family and vice versa. ""There is a persistent assumption that romantic relationships function as a remedy for male loneliness. While intimacy can provide emotional support, research indicates that relying solely on a partner for emotional fulfillment can be precarious. Men who lack broader social networks may experience intense loneliness following relationship conflict, separation, or loss.Moreover, when emotional labor is outsourced entirely to romantic partners, it can strain relationships and reinforce dependency rather than resilience.Dr Mukerji emphasised that mental health care should not be framed as a competition:“From a clinical point of view, if we talk about mental health care, it is not just about comparing who suffers more. It is about, helping people who are struggling and supporting men's mental health does not just take away from women's issues. In fact, healthier men leads to healthier families and relationships. It is very important for men to take care of their mental health irrespective of whatever is happening.”Loneliness, therefore, must be addressed as a social condition rather than an individual romantic deficit.Addressing male loneliness in India requires interventions at multiple levels:Challenging restrictive norms around masculinity and emotional expression is essential. Vulnerability must be reframed as a human capacity rather than a gendered weakness.Mental health education should be integrated into schools, workplaces, and community organizations. Affordable and accessible mental health services are critical, particularly for working-class men.Encouraging participation in community groups, sports clubs, volunteering, and peer support initiatives can help rebuild social capital.Mental health must be treated as a public health priority. Data collection, funding, and targeted programs for men at high risk of isolation are necessary.Male loneliness in India is not a fringe concern or an online exaggeration. It is a widespread, under-acknowledged phenomenon with serious consequences for mental and physical health. While patriarchy shapes this crisis, it does not justify indifference to male suffering. The men who quietly shoulder responsibility, who respect others, and who strive to meet societal expectations deserve to be seen—not as perpetrators by default, but as human beings navigating structural silence.If we are to build a society that values mental well-being, we must move beyond blame and toward understanding. Loneliness, after all, is not a moral failing. It is a signal—and one that India can no longer afford to ignore.",Loneliness is not merely the absence of romantic intimacy.

NEW DELHI: “Suspected fuel starvation” — running out of fuel — reportedly caused a Red Bird training aircraft to force land in an open field about to 50 to 70 km before its destination, Belagavi, on Sunday. Luckily, both the flight instructor and student pilot on board the Cessna 172 aircraft (VT-EUC) are safe. The aircraft is damaged. Aviation authorities are probing this accident.The aviation minister said in a statement: “Redbird Flight Training Academy’s Cessna 172 aircraft while operating a cross country flight (from) Kalaburagi to Belagavi was involved in forced landing in an open field near Vijayapura Sunday due to suspected fuel starvation experienced by the aircraft. The site of forced landing is 50 to 70 km from Belagavi Airport. There were two persons on board, a flight instructor and a trainee pilot. Both the occupants of the aircraft are safe. Due to impact aircraft is damaged… Further investigation will be carried out by DGCA/AAIB.”Red Bird’s operations were briefly stopped by the DGCA in October 2023 after a series of mishaps (luckily all of them non fatal). Its operations resumed after the regulator conducted detailed checks. With 48 aircraft in its fleet, it is one of India’s biggest flying training school.The aircraft that reportedly ran out of fuel on Sunday was built in 1975. At about 300 km, Kalaburagi to Belagavi is a short sector and why the plane reportedly ran out of fuel is something that at the probe will look at.","“suspected fuel starvation” — running out of fuel — reportedly caused a red bird training aircraft to force land in an open field.

Dalai Lama Dragged Into Epstein Drama: Spiritual Leader Named 169 Times, His Office Reacts

NEW DELHI: Union minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday cautioned against linking the Dalai Lama with the recently released Epstein files. He said that the revered spiritual institution should not be dragged into unrelated controversies to malign its sanctity.In a post on X, Rijiju said, “The revered institution of ‘The Dalai Lama’ should not be casually linked with the ‘Epstein Files’ or any other issues, with the motive of damaging the sacred institution. We shouldn't become the casualties of immoral-lifestyle, hookup-culture and unconventional-relationships.”Rijiju’s remarks came amid renewed global debate following the latest release of documents related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein by the US Justice Department. The release has brought a fresh set of prominent names into public discussion, including political leaders, business figures and public personalities, triggering widespread scrutiny and speculation.His statement followed a clarification issued by the office of the Dalai Lama, which firmly denied any association with Epstein. Responding to reports suggesting that the Tibetan spiritual leader’s name appeared in the files, the Dalai Lama’s office said there was no basis to such claims.“Some recent media reports and social media posts concerning the ‘Epstein files’ are attempting to link His Holiness the Dalai Lama with Jeffrey Epstein.We can unequivocally confirm that His Holiness has never met Jeffrey Epstein or authorised any meeting or interaction with him by anyone on His Holiness’s behalf,” the statement said.The latest tranche of documents, released in late January under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, runs into more than three million pages. It includes over 2,000 videos and around 1,80,000 images, making it the largest and final scheduled disclosure of federal material related to Epstein and his associates.The files have referenced or mentioned several high-profile individuals, including US President Donald Trump, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, billionaire Elon Musk, Britain’s Prince Andrew, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, musician Michael Jackson and actor Kevin Spacey, among others.Legal experts and victim advocates have repeatedly stressed that being named in the documents does not imply criminal wrongdoing. They highlighted that the material includes a wide range of records such as contact lists, correspondence, travel logs and third-party references, many of which do not establish any involvement in Epstein’s crimes.Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges and later died in custody. The document release is part of efforts by US authorities to address sustained public pressure for transparency. Under the Transparency Act, the Justice Department was required to disclose relevant investigative material, with redactions to protect victims and sensitive information.",Union minority affairs minister kiren rijiju cautioned against linking the dalai lama with the recently released epstein files.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday once again hit out at Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi over allegations of Pakistan links and his wife’s alleged connections with Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh.Meanwhile, Gogoi hit back in a veiled post on X, attacking Sarma for what he described as “mindless and bogus points” and calling the chief minister’s press conference “C grade cinema”.The political war of words escalated after the Assam cabinet decided to refer the case linked to Gogoi’s alleged Pakistan connections to the ministry of home affairs, with Sarma saying the matter involves national security and cannot be probed further by state agencies.The decision came as Sarma alleged that a Pakistan-based firm had given a job to Gogoi’s British wife Elizabeth Colburn, later transferring her to India, with her salary allegedly paid by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh. The chief minister said the Special Investigation Team has reached a point beyond which it cannot proceed without central assistance.Responding through a veiled X post, Gogoi wrote, ""I pity the journalists from Delhi and Assam who had to suffer the most flop press conference of the century.This was worse than a C grade cinema. Most mindless and bogus points offered by the so called political shrewd Chief Minister. This #SuperFlop is in contrast to our #XomoyParivartanYatra which has been a hit in uncovering the 12,000 bighas of land occupied by the chief minister and his family members"".Briefing reporters after chairing a cabinet meeting in Guwahati, Sarma said the cabinet had decided to hand over the matter to the Centre.“The Assam government had constituted an SIT to inquire into the alleged anti-India conspiracy of Sheikh in connivance with a British citizen and an MP. Keeping in mind the seriousness of the matter, it was decided to hand it over to the MHA,” he said.“The SIT report and the case registered on the basis of which the probe was conducted will be forwarded to the MHA. It can use any of its investigating agencies to take it forward,” Sarma added.He said the cabinet was of the view that the case “involves national security and is not a personal one, with three players involved”.Sarma said the SIT had obtained sensitive material but could not proceed further without assistance from central agencies.“Sensitive information and materials have been obtained by the SIT from various sources,” he said, adding that “help from the Interpol is required. Sensitive information from the central government and Parliament is required”.“We have limitations in our probe. Yet, within these limits, what we have gathered is very important. When it reaches the NIA or IB or CBI, they will take it ahead,” Sarma said.“What we have done is just 10 per cent, 90 per cent is yet to be found out,” he added.Without naming Gogoi, Sarma said, “I can at least confirm that an honourable MP from Assam visited Pakistan when his father was the chief minister.”Gogoi’s father, the late Tarun Gogoi, headed Congress governments in Assam from 2001 to 2016.The chief minister claimed that the MP’s visit to Pakistan was not shared with the central government and alleged that he had gone off social media during the visit.Sarma also said there was proof that one of the persons involved travelled to Pakistan between 2012 and 2016, but added that the Assam Police could not collect telephonic evidence.“The government of Assam has conducted a very good investigation. But, it is not enough as foreign nationals are involved,” he said.The SIT submitted its report to Sarma, who also holds the Home portfolio, on September 10, the date initially set by the chief minister for producing evidence to back his allegations.After multiple delays, Sarma said that “information that is not confidential will be revealed at a press conference” on February 8, with the cabinet authorising him to do so.He also did not rule out the “angle of religious conversion”, though he refused to share details.Earlier, Sarma said the investigation was being conducted purely for national security reasons.“This investigation is for the sake of national security. Its impact on politics is secondary,” he said, adding that a Pakistani national and a British citizen had “central roles” in the case.The SIT was formed to probe alleged interference by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, who was claimed to have links with Gogoi’s British wife Elizabeth Colburn, in India’s internal affairs.At a separate press conference, Sarma accused Gogoi of visiting Pakistan clandestinely in 2013 without informing authorities and claimed it was suspected that he had undergone “some kind of training there”.He also alleged that Gogoi’s wife had collected information about India while working at a firm and passed it on to Pakistan, claiming she had visited Pakistan nine times while working in two Indian organisations.“We believe a deeper connection among Gaurav, his wife, and Ali Tauqeer Sheikh. We recommend a probe by a central agency,” Sarma said.A Pakistani firm gave Elizabeth a job and later transferred her to India, though her salary was paid by Sheikh, he claimed.Gogoi has denied all allegations, calling Sarma’s remarks “ridiculous, baseless, insane and nonsense” and accusing the chief minister of behaving like an “IT cell troll” without facts.In response to claims involving his wife, Gogoi said, “If my wife is an ISI agent of Pakistan, then I am a R&AW agent of India.”He has alleged that the accusations are politically motivated and aimed at diverting attention from allegations against the chief minister.",Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma hits out at congress mp gaurav gogoi over allegations of pakistan links and his wife’s alleged connections with pakistani national ali tauqeer sheikh.

Last year, I could not come to Malaysia for the ASEAN Summit, but I had promised my dear friend that I would visit Malaysia at the earliest. For my foreign visit of 2026, I have come to Malaysia.

In the security sector, we will strengthen cooperation in counter-terrorism, intelligence sharing and maritime security. We will also make defence cooperation more comprehensive.
