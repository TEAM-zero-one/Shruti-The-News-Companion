Canada PM Mark Carney’s First India Trip Finalised, Major Focus On Uranium, Defence And Trade Deals

Carney’s ‘pragmatic’ reset with India

Diplomatic row after Nijjar killing

NEW DELHI: Canada on Wednesday clarified that it does not believe India is linked to violent crimes on its soil, signalling a diplomatic thaw with New Delhi ahead of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to India. This marks a notable shift after months of strained ties between the two countries, as the Toronto Star reported.According to a report by The Toronto Star, a senior Canadian official stated during a background briefing that Ottawa is now confident such alleged activities are no longer continuing.“We have a very robust diplomatic engagement, including between national security advisers, and I think we can say we’re confident that that activity is not continuing,” the official said.Another official added that the visit itself reflects this assessment: “I really don’t think we’d be taking this trip if we thought these kinds of activities were continuing.”The Prime Minister’s Office later clarified that Canada would continue to address transnational repression, organised crime and criminal activity within its borders, while re-engaging with India through law enforcement and security channels.The Toronto Star further reported that the reassessment follows months of high-level security dialogue between the two countries. Officials indicated that communication channels between national security advisers and law enforcement agencies remain active and that engagement with India is being approached in a “step-by-step” and cautious manner.The news agency also highlighted that Carney’s government sees the visit as part of a broader effort to stabilise relations with key global partners, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. However, some Sikh community leaders in Canada expressed concern over the renewed engagement, saying investigations into past allegations should continue transparently even as diplomatic ties improve.This comes as Mark Carney is scheduled to visit Mumbai and New Delhi on Thursday, marking his first trip to India as Prime Minister. He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, business leaders and officials to expand cooperation in trade, energy, technology, artificial intelligence and defence.Canada sees India as an important economic partner. In 2024, bilateral trade between the two countries reached $30.8 billion. Both sides have discussed reviving negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which aims to double trade to $70 billion by 2030.The Toronto Star reported that Carney’s government views engagement with India as part of a broader effort to diversify Canada’s trade partnerships in a more uncertain global environment.However, the shift has drawn criticism from some Sikh activists. Moninder Singh, a religious leader in British Columbia, told the newspaper that he had received multiple police warnings about threats to his life since Nijjar’s killing. He described the renewed engagement as a betrayal.At the same time, Canadian officials said that security dialogue with India continues. Trade minister Maninder Sidhu said Canada can both protect communities at home and engage internationally on economic matters.Relations between Canada and India deteriorated sharply after the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia in June 2023. Months later, then-prime minister Justin Trudeau told the Canadian Parliament there were “credible allegations” linking Indian government agents to the killing.India rejected the allegations as “absurd.” The dispute led to tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats, suspension of visa services, and a freeze in trade talks.India maintained that Canada was giving space to extremist and secessionist elements. After Trudeau’s exit, ministry of external affairs said that it was ready to rebuild ties based on “mutual trust and sensitivity.”MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated that the downturn in relations was caused by the “license that was given to the extremist and secessionist elements” in Canada.","Canada on wednesday clarified that it does not believe india is linked to violent crimes on its soil.

India's international air travel hit record 2 crore passengers in October-December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-international-air-travel-hit-record-2-crore-passengers-in-october-december/articleshow/128798320.cms,"..

NEW DELHI: International air travel in and out of India touched a new quarterly high and crossed the two-crore mark for the first time in October-December 2025.Despite travel to the US remaining subdued due to visa issues across categories such as students and H-1B during President Trump's second presidency; Canada's high rejection rate for Indian visa applicants and issuance delays and the reduction in flights by Air India after AI 171 Ahmedabad crash last June, last calendar year saw 7.8 crore people fly to and from India - 8% more than previous year's 7.2 crore, according to DGCA data.While the share of foreign carriers has been static at 54% as India did not hike the flying rights of a majority of countries whose airlines have a large presence here, the share of Indian carriers has seen a change. In the recent past (after Jet's demise), Air India group was the largest in terms of flying passengers in and out of the subcontinent.That changed in the July-Sept 2025 quarter, with IndiGo since then flying more than the AI Group (see graphic). ""Almost 1.5 crore Indians were issued Passports last year. Only 33-35 lakh of these passport holders travelled abroad last year. So we have a large number of passport holders who are aspiring to travel but have not yet travelled. Combine this with the growing power of the Indian passport with more countries offering visa-on-arrival or visa free access and the growing aspiration of a booming middle class, this segment is bound to grow by leaps and bounds for many years to come.There has been a growth in direct connectivity between India and new destinations abroad , many in the nations frequented by Indians, that is fuelling demand,"" said Anil Kalsi, Travel Agents Federation of India VP.Many countries in the neighbourhood like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand count Indians among their bigger foreign spenders and overseas travellers.""Except North America, every other place is seeing a serious growth in demand from Indian travellers. Given the fact that Indians are very high spenders, many countries are increasingly welcoming them with open arms,"" said officials.",International air travel in and out of india touched a new quarterly high and crossed the two-crore mark for the first time in october-december 2025.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi's visit to Israel rendered a rare moment of bipartisanship in its bitterly fractious and fragmented polity as its leader of opposition Yair Lapid called him a true friend of his country, while PM Netanyahu along with his wife Sara received Modi at the airport, a special gesture that signified their chemistry as well as the bonds between the two countries.Under Modi - the only Indian PM to have visited Israel - ties have strengthened significantly, aided in part by his close equation with Netanyahu and growing cooperation in defence, technology, agriculture and innovation.

He also lightened the moment by pointing out that the saffron shade of Modi's pocket square matched Sara Netanyahu's dress, prompting laughter and signalling the comfort level between the leaders.Reflecting the buzz around the visit, English daily The Jerusalem Post dedicated its front page to the trip, splashing the Hindi greeting ""Namaste"" alongside the Hebrew ""Shalom"" to highlight the warmth in ties. Lapid posted in Hindi that all of Israel was eager to welcome Modi, describing the ties as ""not merely strategic but a bond of deep friendship"".Later, Modi became the first recipient of the ""Speaker of the Knesset Medal"", the highest honour of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset.Speaker Amir Ohana said the Knesset building was illuminated in the colours of the Indian flag in tribute, calling Modi the ""defining statesman of our times"". The significance of the moment was evident as he arrived in Parliament to chants of ""Modi, Modi"" and a standing ovation.Modi stepped down from the podium to greet members across party lines, reciprocating the bipartisan welcome. The reception underscored the broad political consensus in Israel on strengthening ties with India, despite sharp internal divisions that briefly narrowed after the Oct 2023 Hamas attack before resurfacing in domestic politics.","Pm modi's visit to israel rendered a rare moment of bipartisanship in its bitterly fractious and fragmented polity.

Indian Influencer Claims 38 Hour Ordeal In South Korea Raises Questions On Traveller Rights Abroad

NEW DELHI: The Indian Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday issued an advisory urging Indian nationals to exercise caution while traveling to Jeju Island, South Korea, following the detention of content creator Sachin Awasthi.In its advisory, the Embassy highlighted that from time to time, it receives reports of inconveniences faced by Indian travellers, including denial of entry or repatriation upon arrival in Jeju Island under the visa waiver scheme. To minimize such situations, Indian nationals are advised to carefully note the entry requirements and precautions before traveling.The Embassy emphasized that entry under the Jeju visa-free facility is strictly for short-term tourism.""Final admission into the Republic of Korea is determined solely by the immigration authorities at Jeju International Airport in accordance with Korean law. The visa waiver scheme does not guarantee entry,"" it said.Travelers are required to carry mandatory documents including confirmed return air tickets, hotel reservations covering the entire stay, detailed day-wise travel itinerary, proof of sufficient funds, a passport valid for at least six months, travel insurance and accommodation contact details.The advisory warned that passengers unable to clearly explain their travel plan could be at risk of entry denial.The Embassy also highlighted the importance of financial preparedness, stating that ""travelers should be able to demonstrate adequate financial capacity for the duration of stay including for daily expenses, accommodation payment and transport arrangements."" Immigration officers may conduct interviews upon arrival and travelers are advised to respond truthfully and consistently while remaining calm.Indian nationals are reminded that the Jeju visa waiver does not permit travel to mainland Korea, and attempting to leave Jeju without a visa is illegal. Overstays or unauthorized activity could lead to future travel bans. If entry is refused, the passenger will be returned on the next available flight and temporary stay in a holding facility may be required.The advisory comes in the wake of Sachin Awasthi’s detention for 38 hours at Jeju Island. Awasthi, along with his wife, was denied entry, kept in a detention center and forced to book an expensive return ticket.“I am not sharing this for sympathy or drama. Immigration decisions are their authority. But they did not have any right to treat us like criminals,” he said.Jeju Island is one of the three self-governing provinces of South Korea with a special visa-free entry program for foreigners. Indian travelers can enter without a visa only if arriving directly from a foreign country, as entry via mainland South Korea still requires a visa.","The indian embassy in seoul issued an advisory urging indian nationals to exercise caution while traveling to jeju island, south korea.

Our approach to space must reflect our civilisational ethos — ‘Doham Karma Sansadhanam Na Kadapi Shoshanam, Lok Hite Bhutanam Sarakshanam Pratham’ — meaning responsible utilisation of resources, never exploitation, for the welfare and protection of all beings. Space is not merely for defence dominance, but for sustaining the very civilisation we are sworn to protect.”He further said that national security can no longer be viewed solely through a military lens but reflects the collective strength of diplomacy, information, military capability, economic resilience, political leadership, and indigenous technology.

India with Israel & world for dialogue, peace, stability: PM Modi

As he became the first Indian PM to address the Israeli Knesset, Narendra Modi solidly backed Israel on the issue of terrorism, strongly condemning the Oct 7, 2023, attacks and naming Hamas for the ""barbaric"" act, while also asserting that India stood with Israel and with full conviction ""in this moment, and beyond"".Modi did not mention India's long-standing support for a two-state solution, but said the Gaza peace initiative endorsed by UNSC held the promise of a just and durable peace for all people of the region, including by addressing the Palestine issue.""We feel your pain, share your grief. No cause can justify the murder of civilians. Nothing can justify terrorism,"" said Modi, drawing applause. Recalling the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which counted Israeli citizens, too, as victims, Modi said that India, like Israel, follows a consistent and uncompromising zero-tolerance policy against terrorism with no double standards. ""Terrorism aims to destabilise societies, to block development, and to erode trust. Countering terrorism requires sustained and coordinated global action, because terror anywhere threatens peace everywhere,"" said the PM.While on the Gaza issue, PM Modi said the road to peace is not always easy, but India is with Israel and the world for dialogue, peace and stability in this region. ""Let all our efforts be guided by wisdom, courage, and humanity,"" said the PM, while endorsing the UNSC-backed peace initiative that he said offered a path.In his 30-minute speech, Modi also mentioned the Abraham Accords, which had been strongly backed by India.""Some years ago, when you concluded the Abraham Accords, we applauded your courage and vision. It was a moment of new hope for a long-troubled region. Since then, the situation has changed significantly. The path is even more challenging. Yet it is important to sustain that hope,"" said the PM.The PM said a strong partnership between India and Israel not only serves national interests but also contributes to global stability and prosperity. ""Let us ensure that the friendship between India and Israel remains a source of strength in an uncertain world,"" said Modi. He said that with India likely to be among the top three economies globally, and Israel a powerhouse of innovation and technological leadership, there was a natural foundation for a forward-looking partnership. He backed ongoing talks for a free trade agreement, saying India is committed to expanding trade, strengthening investment flows and promoting joint infrastructure development.""Our bilateral goods trade has grown manifold in recent years. But it does not reflect the full scope of opportunity. That is why our teams are working hard to negotiate an ambitious free trade agreement. It will unlock the vast untapped potential in our trade relationship,"" said the PM. He described defence and security as another important pillar of the partnership, saying in today's uncertain world, a strong defence partnership between trusted partners is of vital importance.Modi called for deeper interaction between the two countries in India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and I2U2 frameworks.","Narendra modi was the first indian pm to address the israeli knesset.

Top quotes from Netanyahu's speech

Speaking in the Knesset plenum ahead of visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “My friend Modi's hug is a special hug. It's called Modi Hug around the world. I received it today when my friend landed in Israel.” He highlighted the warmth of their bilateral ties.

around the world. I received it today when my friend landed in Israel.” He highlighted the warmth of their bilateral ties.

Reflecting on the ceremonial welcome, he added, “The heads of state, prime ministers, come to the Knesset, we greet them warmly, and it's always an exciting moment for all of us, and for me too. But, I have to tell you, Narendra, my dear friend, I am deeply moved by your visit here today... I've never been more moved and by your visit here with us, a great friend of Israel, a great champion of the Indian-Israeli alliance.”



On their personal bond, Netanyahu said, “I would almost venture to say, more than a friend, a brother.”



Recalling their previous meeting, he said: “Now, when you were last here, we, the two of us, were on the Mediterranean coast, and I said, why don't we take off our shoes and go into the water?... We didn't walk on water, but we did perform miracles since then. Because what we have done is we've doubled our trade, tripled our cooperation, quadrupled our understanding.”



On PM Modi’s support for Israel, he said: “You stood next to Israel, you stood by Israel, you stood for Israel, you stood for the truth. Thank you, my friend. A great leader on the world stage. Welcome to Jerusalem, my dear friend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and your distinguished delegation.”



Netanyahu emphasised the significance of the India-Israel partnership saying, “India is a gigantic power of almost one and a half billion people. Israel is somewhat smaller, but Israel is gigantic too. I want to say that the alliance between us is an enormous multiplier of our individual powers, an enormous multiplier. It's a multiplier of the spirit and the multiplier of deeds and capabilities.”



On their countries’ global positions, he said, “Two Countries at the Peak of Their Strength. Israel is stronger than ever, and India is stronger than ever.”



Highlighting India’s historical support for Jews, he noted: “In a world where anti-Semitism is rising, India stands out. A civilisation where Jews were never persecuted by the state, only welcomed. We don't forget that, too. Thank you, India.”



Welcoming PM Modi, he said, “Today, it is my great privilege as Speaker of the Knesset to welcome him as the first Prime Minister of India to address the Knesset and to make history once again. Thank you, Prime Minister Modi.”



Netanyahu called Israel’s war against Hamas “a defensive war, a war for the truth, the future of humanity.” “India supports Israel because it understands that Israel serves as a protective wall against barbarism,” he continued, saying, “The massacre of October 7 made it absolutely clear: either the jihadist axis of evil will break us, or we will break it. And we are breaking it — and will break it.”



Talking about building 'alliances', Israeli PM said, ""“In the face of extremist Islam that threatens all humanity and the free nations, we will build together an iron alliance — an alliance of nations that believe in moderation, in progress, in human dignity, in mutual respect. An alliance of nations that sanctify life and are ready to fight against those who sanctify death and seek to return us to the dark barbarism of the Middle Ages.""

Rajiv Gandhi also never shied away from compromising the country. We all know how, at Rahul Gandhi's behest, the Foreign Minister tried to stop the investigation in the Bofors scandal by asking Swedish authorities to do so.

The Gandhi family tarnished the country before the world and compromised it,"" Goyal said.The senior BJP leader also accused Indira Gandhi of ""compromising"" India's interests by mentioning Ambassador Moynihan's ""CIA funded the Congress party "" claims.""Indira Gandhi was no less in compromising the country's interests. We saw how Ambassador Moynihan confirmed that the CIA repeatedly provided funds to the Congress party for elections and that the Congress party ran its politics through the CIA,"" Goyal said.The minister also attacked Rahul over his ""behaviour with the press"" and accused him of addressing ""a curated press conferences"".""We have seen his behaviour with the press. You can't even ask an uncomfortable question to Rahul Gandhi without being tagged as a BJP-associated press person. He only wants curated press conferences.
