Will hit back on our terms: Rajnath conveys India’s resolve against Pak terrorism to Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-hit-back-on-our-terms-rajnath-conveys-indias-resolve-against-pak-terrorism-to-australia/articleshow/121636966.cms,".

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday told Australia that it will strongly retaliate against terrorism emanating from Pakistan on its own terms, without distinguishing between terrorists and their sponsors, and will not be deterred by nuclear blackmail by its western adversary.The stern message on India’s setting a new red line against Pakistan through Operation Sindoor was conveyed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the Australian deputy PM and defence minister Richard Marles here. “India thanks Australia for its unequivocal support to India’s resolute response against the barbaric act of terror in Pahalgam,” Singh said later.Marles later also called on PM Narendra Modi to mark the fifth anniversary of the signing of the India-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership. “Our shared vision for a stable, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific continues to guide our collaboration,” the PM said.During the meeting earlier, the two sides decided to further strengthen their bilateral defence cooperation, including by intensifying and diversifying industrial collaboration, and steadily work together towards their shared commitment for a free and open Indo-Pacific, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.Pakistan’s role in actively aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism, however, was a major focus area. Singh stressed India’s right to respond in self-defence against terrorism, describing recent actions against Pakistan as “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate and responsible”.While the two sides “agreed to work together to combat terrorism in all its forms”, India also stressed that mere condemnation of terror activities was not enough, and all like-minded countries must act against terror facilitators in multilateral fora like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Financial Action Task Force.“Australia was also told that if it expands its defence ties with Pakistan, its military technologies will end up with China. India also said its concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistani elements in Australia should be addressed,” an official told TOI.With defence ties having emerged as an important pillar of the India-Australia partnership, the two countries expressed satisfaction at the growing strategic convergence in different areas.The two countries in November last year had announced an arrangement on air-to-air refueling between their armed forces as part of their expanding military interoperability, while stressing their shared interests in ensuring “stability and security” in the IOR and the larger Indo-Pacific.India already has a military logistics agreement with Australia, which provides for reciprocal refueling, repair and berthing facilities for warships and aircraft, on the lines of the ones it has with other countries like the US, France, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.Moreover, Australia and Japan are regular participants in the top-notch Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992 but includes all “Quad” countries now.India and Australia are now also stepping up cooperation in information exchange, maritime domain awareness and niche areas like AI, cyber, anti-submarine and anti-drone warfare. “India has also showcased its warship-building capabilities, which can lead to joint production,” the official said.",India tells australia that it will strongly retaliate against terrorism emanating from pakistan on its own terms.

Public faith in judiciary gets denuded by corruption among judges: CJI B R Gavai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/public-faith-in-judiciary-gets-denuded-by-corruption-among-judges-cji-b-r-gavai/articleshow/121635924.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the polity still grappling with the sensational incident of discovery of huge amounts of cash at Justice Yashwant Varma’s official residence, CJI B R Gavai has said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system.Speaking on the topic ‘Maintaining Judicial Legitimacy and Public Confidence’ at the UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, “Sadly, there have been instances of corruption and misconduct that have surfaced even within the judiciary. Such incidents inevitably have a negative impact on public confidence, potentially eroding faith in the integrity of the system.”He said legitimacy and public confidence in the judiciary cannot be secured through coercion of command (contempt proceedings) but through the credibility earned by the courts. “Any erosion of this confidence risks weakening the judiciary’s constitutional role as the ultimate arbiter of rights,” he said.Without referring to Justice Varma, who was swiftly inquired into by a three-member judicial panel which in its report found truth in the discovery of cash at the judge’s official residence on Mar 14 night in New Delhi, the CJI said, “The path to rebuilding this trust lies in the swift, decisive, and transparent action taken to address and resolve these issues.”He said every system, no matter how robust, is susceptible to issues of professional misconduct. “In India, when such instances have come to light, the Supreme Court has consistently taken immediate and appropriate measures to address the misconduct,” he said.The CJI said the SC has taken another step to bolster public confidence in the institution through voluntary disclosure of assets by its judges. This enhances transparency and promotes greater accountability and setting an example of ethical leadership, he said.“The Court maintains a dedicated portal where judges’ declarations are made public, demonstrating that judges are willing to subject themselves to a degree of scrutiny, similar to other civil functionaries,” he said.The CJI said though live streaming was done to curb fake news or out-of-context reporting of court proceedings, there are instances where reporters go overboard and give a twist to remarks of judges.“Only last week, one of my colleagues (Justice PV Sanjay Kumar) in a lighter vein counselled a junior counsel on the art of court craft and soft skills. Instead, his statement was taken out of context and reported in the media as, ‘Our ego is very fragile; if you offend it, your case will go out’,” Justice Gavai said, calling out a news article published in a digital media platform dedicatedly reporting court proceedings.In conclusion, he said, “In today’s digital era, where information flows freely and perceptions are rapidly shaped, the judiciary must rise to the challenge of being accessible, intelligible, and answerable, without compromising its independence.”","Cji b r gavai said instances of corruption and misconduct in judiciary adversely impact public faith in the judicial system.

Operation Sindoor: Did India mean to send a message to China too? Shashi Tharoor responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-did-india-mean-to-send-a-message-to-china-too-shashi-tharoor-responds/articleshow/121635693.cms,"Shashi Tharoor in Washington.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is in US leading an all-party delegation on Operation Sindoor executed by the military, on Wednesday (local time) reflected on the Chinese 'kill chain' deployed by Pakistan.Interacting with reporters in Washington, Tharoor was asked if India's military action against Pakistan had a message for China. ""The fact that they (Pakistan) were using Chinese weapons and we were bypassing some of the Chinese radar defences, and the famous sort of Chinese network system. .. it all comes, and that's supposed to be the great sort of Chinese 'kill chain' we read about in the newspapers. When India decided to bypass some of those threats and hit the airfields, I don't think they're worrying about who gets the message. They want to make sure that the Pakistanis got the message, and they got the rough end of what we were sending them, which they did... I do believe that what happened on the night of the 9th and 10th (May) speaks for itself, and even more so, the immediate reaction of Pakistan the next morning to call off the conflict also speaks very vividly for itself, and maybe that's the message the Chinese will have to look at.""He criticised Pakistan's targeting of civilian areas following India's strikes on nine bases belonging to terror organisations listed by the United Nations Terrorism Sanctions Committee, the 1267 Committee's designated terrorists.At the National Press Club in the US on Wednesday (local time), Tharoor described the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam as distressing and disruptive to India's growth trajectory. He noted the significant tourism growth in Kashmir, surpassing visitor numbers to Aspen, Colorado in the previous summer.He said, ""In fact, in Kashmir, it's very striking that the previous summer we've seen more tourism and more tourists coming than Aspen, Colorado gets every year. And in the course of this year, the first few months of this year, there's been a 100 per cent increase on the corresponding months of last year. So Kashmir was booming ordinary, Kashmiris are benefiting from vast numbers of tourists coming in, putting money into their hands and their pockets. It was a lovely time and here's this innocent group of holidays, tourists on a dappled meadow in Kashmir being murdered in cold blood by people coming and asking their religion and shooting them between the eyes.""The Indian Armed Forces initiated Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, which resulted in 26 casualties and numerous injuries.The operation targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists from organisations including Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. Following subsequent Pakistani aggression, Indian Forces responded by targeting their airbases.

Pakistan's propaganda with civilian casualty claims

NEW DELHI: The extent of Pakistan’s losses is becoming increasingly clear as more details emerge from the recent cross-border military conflict dubbed Operation Sindoor Indian Air Force (IAF) retaliatory strikes in response to the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 26 civilians, led to the decimation of significant Pakistani military assets, including fighter jets, surveillance aircraft, drones, and missile systems, forcing Islamabad to seek a ceasefire within four days.According to ANI report on the basis of defence sources involved in the operation, the IAF destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, and one C-130 military transport aircraft. More than ten armed drones (UCAVs), several cruise missiles, and radar sites were also taken out during India's calibrated air campaign, which began late on May 6 and concluded by May 10.The strikes, which included hits on key Pakistani airbases such as Bholari, were executed exclusively using air-launched cruise missiles, avoiding surface-to-surface weapons like the BrahMos. The strikes were carried out by a mix of Rafale and Su-30 MKI fighters, with support from electronic warfare and surveillance assets.One of the most significant hits came in the form of a long-range Sudarshan missile strike, which neutralised a high-value aerial platform, possibly an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEWC) aircraft or an electronic warfare jet, at a range of nearly 300 km.Another AEWC aircraft of Swedish origin, believed to be stationed at the Bholari airbase, was also reportedly destroyed. Although there is suspicion that additional fighter aircraft may have been inside the damaged hangars, officials are not including those in confirmed kill counts due to Pakistan's refusal to clear debris from the site.Meanwhile, Indian air defences effectively intercepted multiple Pakistani air and ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles. The IAF also scored multiple kills on Pakistani drones, including Chinese-made Wing Loong variants, during strikes and airspace incursions.A dossier showed Pakistan accusing India of targeting seven locations beyond the Indian military's officially disclosed targets, including Attock, Bahawalnagar, Gujrat, Jhang, Peshawar, Chhor, and Hyderabad, alleging civilian casualties. Indian officials, however, dismissed the claims as “propaganda”, asserting that all Indian strikes were limited to terror infrastructure, not civilian or military Pakistani centres.“We disclosed our targets transparently. This Pakistani document seems like an attempt to falsely portray Indian actions as indiscriminate,” said an Indian defence official.Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in Jammu & Kashmir. On May 7, India struck four terror hubs in Pakistan and five in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, including high-profile targets like the Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad, Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ), and Markaz Subhan in Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Mohammed HQ).After Pakistan escalated with missile and drone attacks on Indian military and civilian centres, India responded with force, targeting nine Pakistani airbases and multiple radar sites. The intense four-day conflict ended when Pakistan sought a ceasefire on May 10, reeling under mounting losses.","Operation sindoor was launched in retaliation to the pahalgam terror attack that killed civilians in jammu & kashmir.

Once all the buildings are complete, there will be enough space for all,” said a source.The message came amid the plan to shift the first set of offices from North Block to the new buildings and amid the govt’s challenge to find enough space as demanded by ministries and departments.Sources said during the meeting, health secretary Punya Salila Srivasatava made a detailed presentation on obesity, with focus on reducing intake of edible oil by 10%, a call given by PM earlier. In the presentation, she shared the estimated number of obese people in India by 2035 and how the problem is more in urban areas and among children going to private schools, sources said.","“the world saw india’s strength (duniya ne humari takat dekhhi),” pm narendra modi said as he addressed the union council of ministers.

""We didn't see each other. We saw it either through radar or at different ranges, except for what was happening on the LoC. It was a mixture of kinetic and non-kinetic war. When I say non-kinetic, that happened in the information domain and cyber domain. And, of course, there were kinetic operations where destruction was being caused. It was also nonlinear in nature. So there's something happening on the LoC and something happening as far back as Sargodha.""He spoke about how India networked all its air defence architecture and was using AI for predictive analysis.So better and faster information was available to our side. We also tried to kind of network our counter UAS system, which was countering drones.And in the 7-15 days, we were able to do that,"" Gen Chauhan said.The CDS, delivering a special lecture organised by Savitribai Phule Pune University's department of defence and strategic studies on the ""Future of War and Warfare"" on Tuesday, also touched upon data-centric warfare, which will be based on data analysis deciding cognitive or decision superiority. ""Similar green shoots of that were visible in Op Sindoor,"" he said.He also explained how, through Op Sindoor, India raised the bar and redrew new lines for military operations in response to terror.Referring to his previous media statements about India suffering losses, Chauhan said, ""You should be able to understand what went wrong, rectify your mistakes, and go out again despite the initial setbacks. That is a hallmark of a professional force. And that's the kind of thing we displayed. What I said in a couple of my interviews - that losses are not important, it's the outcome which is important."" Chauhan likened it to Test cricket, where, when one side wins by an innings, there are no questions about how many balls or players played.Gen Chauhan said they would share data on the result of Indian strikes based on technical parameters like electronic intelligence and signal intelligence at some point. Stating that it was Pakistan's strategy to bleed India by a thousand cuts, Chauhan said Gen Asim Munir (now field marshal) had spewed similar venom against India and Hindus a few weeks before Pahalgam. ""But these decisions can be retracted as Pakistan is faced with a different kind of prospect, that it faces military action in case we find terror happening against us. So we have kind of raised the bar. We have connected terror to water and we have drawn out new lines for military operations against terror.""When Pakistan did ask for talks and de-escalation, Gen Chauhan said India accepted, but not immediately. According to the CDS, Pakistan's decision to talk stemmed from two facts: ""They must have assumed that if they continued in this mode, they were likely to lose much more. And the second, since they struck us on multiple fronts, they still did not have the benefit of understanding what they struck and they wanted to talk. It is only after one or two days that they realised that all their attacks against us had failed.""Revealing details of the night of the first airstrikes on May 7, the CDS said, ""We did it from 11.05pm to about 1.30am, and five minutes later we rang the director general of military operations to say that we've done this, we hit only terror targets, that military establishments are out of the purview of the strikes, and we ensured that there was no collateral damage to civilians. We need to talk to each other.""The CDS said war has expanded into space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic domain, etc. ""A lot of activities took place between both of us for four days in the electromagnetic domain.

Collegium system reforms can't be at cost of judicial independence: CJI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-system-reforms-cant-be-at-cost-of-judicial-independence-cji/articleshow/121632719.cms,"Unwarranted interference led to collegium system, says CJI

Amid a clamour for legislative revamp of the judges-selecting-judges system, fuelled by Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar's statements, CJI B R Gavai has said no reform in the collegium system could be at the ""cost of judicial independence"" and that judiciary should retain its primacy in appointments to Supreme Court and high courts.At a round-table in UK Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, CJI Gavai said, ""There may be criticism of the collegium system, but... judges must be free from external control.""CJI said SC had struck down National Judicial Appointments Commission Act in 2015 as the law attempted to dilute judiciary's independence by giving primacy to the executive in court appointments.Tracing the evolution of the collegium system through two SC judgments in 1993 and 1998, the CJI said the executive had the final say in appointment of judges to Supreme Court and HCs till 1993 and that system saw two senior-most judges of SC getting superseded in the appointment of CJIs (both by the govt headed by Indira Gandhi) in breach of established traditions.He said the collegium system evolved as judiciary's response to the executive's excesses and unwarranted interference in appointments to constitutional courts.As per the two judgments concerned, the collegium was to act in unanimity and its decision was to be final, Justice Gavai said, adding that this ""sought to ensure independence of judiciary, reduce executive interference and maintain judiciary's autonomy in its appointments"".Quoting B R Ambedkar's words - ""our judiciary must both be independent of the executive and must also be competent in itself"" - the CJI said the fact that constitutional courts drew salaries from the Consolidated Fund of India made judges independent of the executive.Referring to Kesavananda Bharati judgment of 1973 that propounded the basic structure doctrine by a 13-judge bench through seven to six majority, CJI Gavai said, ""This ruling established a significant judicial precedent, affirming that certain fundamental principles, such as democracy, rule of law, and the separation of powers, are inviolable and cannot be altered.""","Unwarranted interference led to collegium system, says cji b r gavai.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on Wednesday delivered a scathing rebuke of Pakistan and its political-military establishment during a public address in Brussels, targeting former Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari without naming him.Referring to Bhutto's remarks, Chaturvedi said, “The person who is leading the delegation, in his parliamentary speech, said ‘Kon raat ke andhere mein hamle karte hain, Buzdil raat ke waqt hamle karte hain’... ‘Buzdil’ are those who do a coup on an elected government and after sending them to jail, murder the elected Prime Minister, so that the army can control the government.”Her comments referenced Bhutto's remarks on India's military response to Islamabad's terror attacks. Chaturvedi flipped that accusation, linking true cowardice to Pakistan's history of military coups and political assassinations, including the killing of Benazir Bhutto and the ousting of Imran Khan.In a sharp critique of the Pakistani state’s support for terrorism , she called on the international community to confront Islamabad’s role. “It is high time that we ask the international community to stand up in unison and call out this kind of terror activities emanating from Pakistan...Pakistan has become a hub, the economic model to use terrorism as a way to try and hold the world to ransom... Call them out in the UNSC... till you don't call them out, this is a failed fight against terrorism that the European Union is running. ”She highlighted India’s resilience against Pakistan across fields—from military conflict to cricket—saying, “We have decades of experience of showing them their place. Our armed forces have defeated them, we have defeated you in cricket, trade... How many more times do they want to get humiliated by us?”Her remarks came as part of an all-party parliamentary delegation led by BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad currently touring Europe, including Belgium, to raise concerns about terrorism and highlight the Indian position on global platforms. The delegation includes BJP and Congress leaders, along with former diplomats, and is engaging with EU officials, think-tanks, and diaspora communities.The diplomatic effort follows the recent terror attack in Pahalgam and India’s subsequent airstrikes on terror bases in Pakistan and PoK.",Shiv sena (ubt) mp priyanka chaturvedi delivered a scathing rebuke of pakistan and its political-military establishment during a public address in brussels.

NEW DELHI: As an American team touches down in the Capital for negotiating the proposed bilateral trade agreement, government is keeping close tabs on the legal dispute over Trump’s tariffs and the concessions being offered by the US administration to other countries given that the talks are focusing on how both countries can get better market access.The Trump administration is seeking to use the 10% baseline tariffs and the suspended reciprocal tariffs (26% in India’s case) to negotiate trade deals. The court setback, which was stayed a day later, has injected fresh uncertainty, and the government is keen to ensure that it manages to extract the best deal for Indian companies.“What we get compared to other countries will be what we will ultimately finalise in the deal,” a government official said.At the same time, India is conscious of the strategic ties with the US and is looking to step up import of shale gas, LNG, and crude oil from America to diversify its import basket, as prices of these items are lower in the US, an official said. This is expected to help bridge the trade gap of over $40 billion in India’s favour, a major grudge with Trump, who has been doling out various numbers to justify his tariffs actions.How the US administration works out the trade deal will also determine the government’s future course of action on retaliating against some of the tariff hikes introduced by Trump, such as those on steel and aluminium products.“Exports are increasing... there are several things we can buy from the US... For example, shale gas, LNG, crude oil. The more diversified our sources, the greater the benefit for us. Prices are also low in the US,"" the official, who did not wish to be named, said.","The government is keen to ensure that it manages to extract the best deal for indian companies.

NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi , who was part of a multi-party delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda to four Gulf countries, launched a scathing attack on Pakistan on Wednesday, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism through illicit financial networks and promoting extremist ideologies.Speaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi described Pakistan as the “epicentre of Takfirism” and alleged that its government, deep state, and intelligence agency ISI were complicit in funding terror groups. “We represented India over there... and told them Pakistan has been indulging in terrorism in India for many years,” he said.He added that the Resistance Front, which was behind the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , was essentially a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba , and India's concerns had already been conveyed to the United Nations Security Council’s 1262 sanctions committee.Owaisi further referred to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir’s speech on April 15, implying its alignment with extremist ideology. “Terrorism survives on two things, ideology and money,” he said, urging the international community to act on both fronts. “A form of polio exists only in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan… there is 40% poverty in Pakistan, so where is the money going?”He noted that the four nations visited, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Algeria, were part of groups like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), and had previously backed India’s diplomatic push to place Pakistan on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2018.During their stop in Algeria, Owaisi reiterated that “there is no ideological difference between the terrorist groups in Pakistan and Daesh and Al-Qaeda”. He stressed that Islam does not permit violence and said the international community must act against countries that provide ideological and financial shelter to terrorists.He also said that placing Pakistan back on the FATF grey list would significantly reduce terror attacks in India. “Once you bring Pakistan back in the grey list, we will see a decrease in terrorism in India… we have the 2018 experience when Algeria and other countries helped India,” he said.Referring to the case of 26/11 handler Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Owaisi added, “The trial progressed immediately when Pakistan was put on the Grey list. That tells you how effective FATF can be.”The eight-member delegation, including MPs Nishikant Dubey, Phangnon Konyak, Rekha Sharma, Satnam Singh Sandhu, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, met leaders and think tanks in the four countries to highlight India’s stand on terrorism, particularly following the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor.According to news agency PTI, the delegation also presented its feedback to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday.Jaishankar reportedly congratulated the delegation and said the objectives of the visit were fulfilled. “All four countries have taken clear steps against terrorism and understand India’s principled stand,” said Panda.","All india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (aimim) chief asaduddin owaisi was part of a multi-party delegation led by bjp mp baijayant panda to four gulf countries.

'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"Poll Do you believe India’s water resources are secure despite external concerns? Yes, India’s water is secure No, more precautions are needed

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma hit back at pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative.

Burundi: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Burundi had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52 percent.

Cuba: The US called Cuba, a state sponsor of terrorism, and said that their government does not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with the United States. ""Cuba has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 18.75 percent,"" the White House said in a statement.

Laos: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Laos had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent. Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

Sierra Leone: ""According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent. Sierra Leone has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals,"" the White House said in a statement.

Togo: The United States claimed that the Togo had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 19.03 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.05 percent.

Turkmenistan: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Turkmenistan had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 21.74 percent.

Venezuela: As per the White House's statement, Venezuela lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. Venezuela has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Venezuela had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 9.83 percent.





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation implementing a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, citing national security risks, according to the White House.""The Proclamation fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals from 12 countries found to be deficient with regard to screening and vetting and determined to pose a very high risk to the United States,"" the White House said in a statement.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson posted on X: ""President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm.""During his initial presidency, Trump introduced restrictions on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a policy that underwent several revisions before receiving Supreme Court approval in 2018, Reuters reported. However, his successor, Democratic President Joe Biden, abolished these restrictions in 2021, stating it was ""a stain on our national conscience."": The US said that Afghanistan, which is under the control of Taliban - designated as SDGT group, has no effective central authority to handle passport issuance or civil documentation. The nation also lacks proper screening and vetting protocols.The White House statement referenced the Fiscal Year 2023 DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Report, which revealed that Afghan nationals had a 9.70 percent overstay rate for business/tourist (B1/B2) visas.Additionally, the report indicated a significantly higher overstay rate of 29.30 percent for student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa categories.: According to the US citing Overstay Report, Burma had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent. Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.: ""According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent. The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for US immigration laws,"" as per the statement released by the White House.: As per the US, the Republic of the Congo exhibited significant visa overstay percentages, as detailed in the Overstay Report. The data revealed that 29.63 percent of B1/B2 visa holders remained beyond their authorised stay. Additionally, for academic-related visas (F, M, and J categories), the overstay rate was notably higher at 35.14 percent.: ""According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 70.18 percent,"" the statement read.: The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea. Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals. Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.43 percent.: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Haiti had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05 percent. The statement also claimed that hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration. This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.The US also said that the Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States.: The United States Government has designated Iran as a nation that supports terrorist activities. According to the White House statement, Iran consistently demonstrates non-cooperation with American authorities in identifying potential security threats. Additionally, the country serves as a significant source of global terrorism and has shown a persistent unwillingness to accept the return of its deportable citizens.: According to the US, Libya lacks a functioning central government capable of issuing reliable passports and civil documentation. The nation's ongoing challenges with terrorist organisations operating within its borders heighten security concerns regarding the admission of Libyan nationals into the United States.: ""Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects,"" the White House said in a statement.According to the US, the persistent terrorist threat emanates from Somalia’s territory. The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven. Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations. Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.""The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement. Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals,"" the statement reads.: According to the US, the nation faces significant challenges in document verification due to the absence of an effective central governing body responsible for passport and civil documentation issuance. The country also lacks proper screening protocols, as stated by the White House.: In a statement, the White House said that Yemen operates without an efficient central authority to manage passport and civil document issuance, alongside inadequate screening procedures. It also said that their inability to maintain territorial control compounds these issues. Since January 20, 2025, Yemen has been experiencing ongoing US military activities within its borders.The Proclamation partially also restrict and limit the entry of nationals from 7 countries who also pose a high level of risk to the United States.","Us president donald trump issued a proclamation implementing a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, citing national security risks.

NEW DELHI: India has warned Turkish Airlines to comply with all rules after a surprise inspection of its aircraft at four airports over the last one week revealed lapses, including the alleged carriage of explosives without disclosing the same on one flight.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had conducted “safety oversight and ramp (SOFA/RAMP)” inspections of the airline’s passenger and cargo flights at Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Bengaluru from May 29 to June 2, 2025. The operations of Turkish to India will be under the lens as the regulator says it will conduct flow-up inspections “as necessary to ensure continuous safety oversight.”The key lapses found during this surprise “surveillance of foreign (Turkish) aircraft” include: “The cargo contained dangerous goods for which permission is required from DGCA for carriage of explosives to/from over India. This was not found to be attached, nor was it mentioned in the dangerous goods declaration,” according to an aviation ministry statement.The other findings include: “At Bengaluru, the marshaller handling ground operations lacked proper authorisation and a valid competency card for marshalling functions. During the arrival of aircraft, the aircraft maintenance engineer (AME) was unavailable, and the arrival procedure was carried out by a technician instead.Airworks is the authorised engineering service provider for Turkish Airlines,” it added.The check revealed there was no “service level agreement in place between Turkish Airlines and its ground handling agent (GHA). Equipment such as ladders, step ladders, trolleys and ground power units (GPUs) lacked proper accountability and monitoring at Hyderabad and Bengaluru, where Globe Ground India was providing ground services without formal handover from Celebi,” the ministry statement said.“The DGCA emphasises its unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and regulatory compliance of all foreign operators within Indian airspace. Turkish Airlines has been directed to address these findings promptly and ensure full compliance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards and recommended practices as well as DGCA regulations. Further follow-up inspections will be conducted as necessary to ensure continuous safety oversight. ”Senior officials say the checks were conducted on Turkish Airlines aircraft operated by the airline and not the two Boeing 777s wet-leased (hired with crew) by IndiGo from it. Turkish and IndiGo each operate a daily passenger flight between Delhi & Istanbul and Mumbai & Istanbul.Following Turkey’s support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and the firing of Turkish drones by Pakistan, New Delhi is reviewing its ties with Istanbul. The security clearance of Turkish ground handler Celebi was withdrawn last month and it had to wind up activities from nine Indian airports. Then the DGCA asked IndiGo to wrap up its wet lease of two Boeing 777s from Turkish by Aug 31, 2025, by giving a “last and final three-month extension. ” This final extension was given after getting an “undertaking from (IndiGo) that they will terminate the damp lease with Turkish Airlines within this extension period, and not seek any further extension for these operations.”",India has warned turkish airlines to comply with all rules after a surprise inspection of its aircraft at four airports.
