'Op Sindoor Remains On': Army Chief Dwivedi WARNS Pakistan, Hails Stability In J&K And Manipur

NEW DELHI: Eight Army personnel were injured on Sunday in a prolonged gunfight with terrorists in a remote forested area of the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district.The encounter, which lasted for several hours, erupted when security forces came in contact with terrorists during a search operation in the general area of Sonnar, northeast of Chatroo. The operation, launched around noon, has been named Operation Trashi-I by the Army’s Jammu-based White Knight Corps.In a post on X, the White Knight Corps said the search was part of ongoing joint counter-terror operations being conducted with the Jammu and Kashmir Police. “Operations remain underway with additional forces inducted to reinforce the cordon, supported by close coordination with civil administration and security agencies,” the Army said, praising the troops for their professionalism while responding to hostile fire in difficult terrain and conditions.Officials said one of the search teams encountered a group of two to three foreign terrorists, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).The terrorists allegedly opened indiscriminate fire and hurled grenades in an attempt to break the cordon. The troops retaliated, following which reinforcements from the Army, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and police were rushed to the area to tighten the cordon.Intermittent firing continued until around 5.40 pm. Eight soldiers sustained injuries, mostly splinter wounds from grenade blasts, and were evacuated to hospital. A massive search operation is continuing to track down and neutralise the terrorists.Advanced surveillance equipment, including drones, along with sniffer dogs, has been deployed to speed up the operation.This is the third encounter between security forces and terrorists in the Jammu region this year. Earlier gunfights were reported in the Kahog and Najote forests of the Billawar area in Kathua district on January 7 and 13.On December 15 last year, a police officer was killed in an encounter with terrorists in Soan village of the Majalta area in Udhampur district. The terrorists managed to escape by taking advantage of thick foliage and darkness.These encounters come in the wake of a major counter-terror operation launched across forest belts of the Jammu region in December last year to flush out nearly three dozen terrorists believed to be hiding in the area.Security operations have been further intensified ahead of Republic Day amid intelligence inputs of renewed attempts by Pakistan-based handlers to push in more terrorists, officials said.","Eight army personnel were injured on sunday in a prolonged gunfight with terrorists in a remote forested area of jammu and kashmir’s kishtwar district.

How India got its first woman PM this day in 1966,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-india-got-its-first-woman-pm-this-day-in-1966/articleshow/126663187.cms,"On Jan 19, 1966, the high-domed Central Hall of Parliament — where India’s Constitution had been adopted — witnessed a spectacle unlike any before. For the first time since Independence, the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) elected its leader through a full-fledged contest. Out of that tense, four-hour drama emerged Indira Gandhi , 48, as India’s first woman Prime Minister.“She was cheered as she entered the hall, clad in a white sari with a light brown shawl wrapping her shoulders,” TOI reported. When the returning officer announced, “I declare Mrs Gandhi elected,” the hall broke into “thunderous cheers”. It was not merely a personal triumph. The vote marked a turning point for the Congress party — and for the way succession battles would be fought within it.After Lal Bahadur Shastri’s sudden death in Tashkent, in Jan 1966, India was without a Prime Minister once again. Acting PM Gulzarilal Nanda took charge.Indira Gandhi did not enter a smooth succession. The only daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, she had long lived in his shadow — first as his companion, later as a political figure in her own right. She had served as information minister under Shastri and as Congress president in 1960.Powerful regional leaders — chief ministers of 11 of India’s then 16 states — rallied behind her, signalling support just four days before the vote. Another contender, Nanda, withdrew. But Morarji Desai, the formidable former finance minister, refused to step aside.“Why should I form a separate party? I am a true Congressman and I will remain in the Congress,” Desai declared. What many expected to be a smooth transition became one of the most bitterly fought leadership contests in India’s parliamentary history.At the centre of the storm was Congress president K Kamaraj, who tried to avoid a contest. However, Desai insisted on a ballot, alleging “pressure” on MPs to back a particular candidate. Chief ministers, he said, had “no business” imposing their preferences on the CPP. Kamaraj countered that in a federal democracy, the views of the states mattered.On the eve of the vote, Desai told reporters that MPs were “not dumb cattle” and framed the battle as one between the party establishment and ordinary parliamentarians. He said he had proof of pressure — but declined to elaborate, arguing that naming supporters could expose them to victimisation if he lost.As the vote neared, Delhi became a political beehive. Chief ministers met MPs from their states, and journalists camped outside the homes of Kamaraj, Desai and Indira Gandhi.On Jan 19, the Central Hall filled with 526 Congress MPs — a record turnout. Desai arrived first, greeting members with folded hands. Minutes later, Indira Gandhi walked in, went up to Desai, said “namaste,” and posed with him as photographers urged them to clasp hands.In the nominations, the lines were clear. Desai was proposed by K Hanumanthaiya. Indira Gandhi’s name was proposed by acting Prime Minister Nanda and seconded by Sanjiva Reddy.Counting dragged on through the afternoon, fuelling tension and rumours of an imminent result. Four times there were false alarms. Then, around 3pm, the returning officer emerged.“I declare Mrs Gandhi elected.”The figures were emphatic: 355 votes for Indira Gandhi, 169 for Morarji Desai — nearly 68% of the valid votes, a two-thirds majority that even her supporters had scarcely dared hope for. What followed was as theatrical as the contest itself. Amid cheers, the two candidates shook hands and posed for press photographers and TV crews. Outside Parliament House, crowds had gathered all day; when the result became known, they cheered as Gandhi went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet the President S Radhakrishnan to form a new govt.Desai pledged cooperation, though with a sting: he hoped that “at least in future, an atmosphere of fearlessness” would be created in party and country. Indira Gandhi, at her first press conference, rejected any insinuation of foul play. “The insinuation that unfair play had a part in this election was unjustified,” she said, while agreeing that fearlessness in public life mattered.Reactions poured in across India. C Rajagopalachari said Gandhi might be more broad-minded, and closer to Nehru’s outlook, than Desai. Women’s groups celebrated.Abroad, the response was swift. The Soviet news agency Tass flashed the news within minutes. Lord Mountbatten called her election one that was bound to have a stabilising effect in India.As Kamaraj told MPs that day, “We have elected Mrs Gandhi to take over the burden of the Prime Ministership of the country.”Research: Rajesh Sharma","For the first time since independence, the congress parliamentary party elected its leader through a full-fledged contest.

IndiGo to inform if it can fly 2k flights daily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indigo-to-inform-if-it-can-fly-2k-flights-daily/articleshow/126662186.cms,"IndiGo chaos lasted beyond 3 days DGCA probed: Pilots body

NEW DELHI: As IndiGo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for A320 fleet pilots expires Feb 10, the airline must tell DGCA this week, likely Monday, whether it can still run more than 2,000 flights a day under the new rules that increase pilot requirement, reports Saurabh Sinha.If it cannot, authorities are expected to step in and cut flights in time to avert a repeat of last December's chaos, for which the DGCA fined the airline Rs 22.2cr, an amount pilots' body has dismissed as ""peanuts"", saying the regulator counted only three days of disruption when the turmoil lasted far longer.Regular meetings are being held with IndiGo to get a status on their preparedness for once the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) exemption ends on Feb 10. They have informed us about their pilot hiring plans. The airline has been doing dry runs with its scheduling software by matching available pilot strength with number of flights to be operated. On Monday they are expected to share their post Feb 10 preparedness,” said people in the know.It is learnt that from Feb 1 IndiGo will plan its crew rosters as per new FDTL rules and without factoring in the current exemption that will end later that month.IndiGo flights have been reduced till the end of winter schedule (which ends on last Saturday in March) and the airline plans to serve its entire network with these cuts under the new FDTL rules. It is learnt IndiGo may not seek any further exemptions.The aviation ministry and the DGCA are keeping a very close watch on the situation. “We can’t and won’t allow a repeat of what happened last Dec,” said sources.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has termed the DGCA’s Rs 22.2cr fine on IndiGo as “peanuts” and questioned some aspects of its report. FIP president Captain CS Randhawa said: “The DGCA probe takes cognisance of IndiGo flight disruptions only on three days — Dec 3, 4 & 5. In reality, the disruptions lasted much longer till about mid Dec and the scale was much higher.”Captain Randhawa questioned the lack of action. “Issuing a warning letter after a massive disruption of this scale is a joke, like the fine amount. Also with IndiGo flights cut, why hasn’t the FDTL exemption been revoked? The DGCA is levying a fine of Rs 30 lakh for each day of non-compliance of the new flight duty rules. Does it mean that non-compliance of the law can be traded with a penalty?” Captain Randhawa said.IndiGo said on Saturday that it is “committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures… an in-depth review of the robustness and resilience of the internal processes at IndiGo (is) underway to ensure that the airline emerges stronger out of these events in its otherwise pristine record of 19 plus years of operations..”","Indigo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for a320 fleet pilots expires feb 10.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership.

The unverified claims, linked to Offset, have divided fans as Diggs and Cardi B remain silent and focus on their careers.

Stefon Diggs under fire after influencer hints at chaos during Cardi B’s childbirth

Shockwaves rippled through social media as a fresh allegation involving Stefon Diggs and Cardi B pushed their already turbulent spotlight into overdrive. The claim did not come from court filings or official statements. It came from influencer chatter.At the center of the controversy is a story tied to childbirth, legal confusion, and personal loyalty. Fans reacted swiftly, some stunned, others skeptical. The situation gained traction not because of proof, but because of how personal the accusation felt. In an era where rumors move faster than facts, silence often becomes part of the story.The controversy stems from remarks made by influencer Celina Powell, who said she learned details from Offset, Cardi B’s ex-husband. According to Powell, Diggs was present briefly during the hospital stay but became upset after learning that Offset’s name could legally appear on the birth certificate due to Cardi B’s marital status at the time. Powell alleged that Diggs left the hospital and was absent for several days afterward. None of these claims have been verified.Diggs and Cardi B have not spoken out against the allegations. Such silence has enabled speculation to thrive and more so as Diggs still continues his season with the New England Patriots under close scrutiny of the public eye.To make it even worse, Diggs is also struggling with another legal issue with a former private chef which is still pending.In the meantime, Cardi B has remained dedicated to her career including building her forthcoming tour. She retained composure in the face of adversaries and this has earned her approval among those who believe that fantasy should not ascribe her personal life.It has caused fans to be divided. There are those who call on restraint and respect, on the want of confirmation. There is an opinion that the accusations are raising great questions that should be clarified. This story is a commentary on the collision of celebrity, influence, and speculation in the moment, until the facts have been proved.","An influencer has sparked online backlash by alleging stefon diggs mistreated cardi b during the birth of their child.

What the New York Mets Gain and Weighing Risks

The New York Mets are adjusting after parting ways with a player who spent nearly a decade with the organization. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the front office is focused on finding a short-term outfield option that limits spending and avoids long-term commitments.That approach has led them to Max Kepler. He is not viewed as a marquee signing but as a steady replacement. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets reliable defense and left-handed power while preserving roster flexibility.The New York Mets’ direction changed after a one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo waived his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million tenure in New York.Nimmo was still productive in 2025. He appeared in 143 games and hit .261 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs. Even so, the Mets chose to address their infield and manage payroll. Semien now anchors second base, but the trade left a clear vacancy in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was limited by knee issues. His surface numbers declined, but the Mets value his defense and remaining power.In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and fits cleanly into a corner role.A short-term deal also matches the Mets’ plans. Prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Max Kepler would fill the gap without blocking that path. The lower salary compared to Nimmo’s deal also leaves room to address pitching.Max Kepler would give the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a much lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concerns are durability and age. Kepler is in his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field situation long term, leaving the Mets to rely on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to sign $10.2 million New York Yankees; Brady Singer key trade asset?

Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States completes the top ten with connectivity to 179 destinations. Although still formidable, its passport has experienced a modest decline in recent years. Visa policy and reciprocity influence the landscape, positioning it slightly below several comparable nations in terms of global mobility.","Henley passport index 2026 reveals world's most powerful passports.

'Real Friends Can Disagree, But...': US Envoy Sergio Gor On India-US Ties, Comments On Trade Deal

US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor on Sunday concluded his visit to Mumbai, describing it as a “very successful trip.” He said the engagements helped build strong momentum in trade and other key areas of cooperation between India and the United States.In a post on X, Gor said his engagements in Mumbai reflected the breadth of the bilateral partnership.“Wrapping up a very successful trip to Mumbai! Great meetings with Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra, Chairman of Reliance Industries Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Tata Companies N Chandrasekaran, executives from India’s pharmaceutical sector and religious faith leaders,” he wrote.“We’re building strong momentum across trade, technology, education, energy, and resilient supply chains as the U.S.–India partnership continues to grow!,” US envoy added in his post.The visit comes as part of Gor’s broader engagement with key Indian institutions and business leaders following his assumption of office.Earlier, Gor had formally presented his credentials to President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 14, marking the start of his tenure in India.He has since held a series of meetings with senior government officials, regulators and business leaders, with a focus on deepening economic and institutional ties.As part of his engagements, the US envoy met Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral cooperation, particularly in the technology and financial sectors. The meeting was seen as significant amid ongoing efforts by both sides to expand trade and investment links.Gor also met N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Companies, and highlighted the group’s long-standing presence in the United States.During his Mumbai visit, Gor toured the US Consulate, describing it as the start of renewed efforts to strengthen people-to-people and institutional ties.“Excited to kick off my first visit to Mumbai with a visit to our Consulate! Our dedicated team is working hard to bolster the US-India partnership,” he wrote.After presenting his credentials earlier this week, Gor said it was an honour to serve in India “at a time of such promise and opportunity” in the relationship.He added that he looked forward to working closely with the Indian government and people to advance shared priorities in defence, trade, energy, technology and critical minerals, reinforcing what he described as a partnership that will help define the 21st century.",Us ambassador to india sergio gor on sunday concluded his visit to mumbai.

European leaders have pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat, warning that using trade penalties in connection with Greenland is ""wrong"" and could damage transatlantic ties.Trump, on Saturday, announced a 10% tariff on all goods entering the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, effective February 1.After the threat, leaders across Europe have emphasised that Greenland’s future cannot be controlled through economic pressure and insisted that security cooperation in the Arctic must not be turned into a trade dispute.British PM Keir Starmer took to X, saying that the status of Greenland was not open to outside interference and criticised the use of tariffs against Nato partners. ""Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes. We have also made clear that Arctic Security matters for the whole of Nato and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic.He further added, ""applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.""French President Emmanuel Macron said that France’s foreign policy is based on defending sovereignty and independence and warned that Europe would not yield to threats.""France is committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere ... Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context. Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld. It is in this spirit that I will engage with our European partners.""Sweden’s PM Ulf Kristersson also criticised the tariffs, saying that Stockholm would not accept getting ""blackmailed"" and called for a joint European response. ""We will not let ourselves be blackmailed. Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.""He further added, ""I will always stand up for my country, and for our allied neighbors. This is an EU issue that affects many more countries than those now being singled out. Sweden is now having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway, and the United Kingdom for a coordinated response.""European Council President Antonio Costa said that Europe and the wider international community must defend territorial integrity and sovereignty, warning that tariffs could spark a dangerous escalation. ""Territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. They are essential for Europe and for the international community as a whole. We have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through Nato. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.""Costa further highlighted the bloc's support for Denmark and Greenland. ""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US. Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty. ""Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump’s remarks were unexpected and insisted that the increased military presence in Greenland was aimed at stability, not confrontation. ""The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the president refers, is precisely to enhance security in the Arctic,"" he said, adding that Denmark was coordinating closely with Brussels and other partners.""We are in close contact with the European Commission and our other partners on the matter,"" Rasmussen added, following recent White House talks involving US and Greenlandic officials.In Germany, European Parliament member Manfred Weber warned that Trump’s stance could block progress on the EU–US trade deal agreed last year. ""The EPP is in favour of the EU–US trade deal, but given Donald Trump’s threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,"" Weber said.""The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold.""The EU and the US agreed to a preliminary trade deal in July under which most European exports would face a 15% US tax, but talks are still ongoing and the deal’s future is now uncertain amid rising political tensions.","Trump announced a 10% tariff on all goods entering the united states from denmark, norway, sweden, france, germany, the united kingdom, the netherlands and finland, effective february 1.

Strategic diversification underway



Gold buying gathers pace



China has pushed its holdings of US government debt down to their lowest level in nearly two decades, underscoring a steady recalibration of its foreign exchange reserves away from dollar assets and towards gold and overseas investments amid strained ties with Washington, PTI reported.Data released by the US Department of the Treasury shows that China’s holdings of US Treasuries fell to $682.6 billion in November, down from $688.7 billion in October, marking the lowest level since 2008.The reduction comes even as overall foreign ownership of US debt touched a record high, with key allies stepping in. Japan raised its holdings by $2.6 billion to $1.2 trillion, while the UK increased its exposure by $10.6 billion to $888.5 billion, according to the same data.Analysts say Beijing’s continued trimming of US debt reflects a broader strategy to diversify reserve assets amid concerns over geopolitical risk and the long-term sustainability of American public debt.China currently holds the world’s largest foreign exchange reserves, totalling $3.3579 trillion at the end of December 2025, official media reported.“The decrease in China's holdings of the US treasuries is a result of increased optimisation and diversification of holdings of foreign assets seen in recent years, which helps strengthen the overall safety and stability of the portfolio,” Xi Junyang, professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the state-run Global Times.Shao Yu, chief economist at the Sci-tech Innovation Management Research Centre at Fudan University, said Beijing appeared determined to further reduce exposure to US debt as fiscal risks mount.“The massive accumulation of debt resembles a Ponzi scheme, where larger volumes of new debt are used to replace the old. China doesn’t want to play this game anymore,” he told the South China Morning Post.Alongside the drawdown in US Treasuries, China has been steadily boosting its gold reserves, reinforcing gold’s role as a hedge against external shocks.Latest figures from the People's Bank of China show that the country’s gold reserves rose to 74.15 million ounces by the end of December 2025, up 30,000 ounces from the previous month. This marked the 14th consecutive month of gold accumulation by the central bank.Xi Junyang said the central bank is likely to continue increasing gold holdings as part of efforts to strengthen reserve stability and improve resilience against global volatility, noting that gold still forms a relatively smaller share of China’s reserves compared with other major economies.","China's holdings of us treasuries fell to $682.6 billion in november, down from $688.7 billion in october.

Allen Iverson’s ultimate financial safety net

The divorce settlement bifurcated Iverson’s trust fund



What is Allen Iverson doing now?



In the high-stakes world of NBA contracts, there are flashy max deals, and then there is the absolute masterclass in foresight known as the Allen Iverson Life Line. While he was busy breaking ankles and redefining league culture in the early 2000s, Allen Iverson’s team was quietly securing a financial legacy that would outlast his playing years by decades.It is one of the most legendary financial savings stories in sports history, and as Iverson, but as he inches closer to his mid-50s, it turns out he’s about to execute the greatest fast-break in the history of sports business: a $32 million trust fund courtesy of Reebok.Back in 2001, when Iverson was at his peak with the 2000-01 MVP award, he wrote history as the shortest player (6’0”) ever to win it. The same year, he also signed the ultimate financial safety net with Reebok. Taking into consideration his reputation as a lavish spender, Iverson’s agent and Reebok structured this unique lifetime contract that would support him in his post-league life.The deal included a yearly stipend in which Reebok will pay Iverson $800,000 every year for life. A lump sum trust fund of $32 million was set aside, but Iverson couldn’t touch it until he turned 55 years old. This year, on June 7th, Iverson will turn 51, and after 4 more years, in 2030, he can finally access this money.In a game of fate, Iverson lost his entire trust fund to his wife, Tawana Turner, after violating their postnuptial agreement. But Turner, instead of taking the entire check, decided to leave 50% with Iverson that saved him from financial ruin. When the fund finally matures in 2030, Iverson will likely walk away with $16 million, while the other $16 million goes to his ex-wife.Iverson’s career and life have given him some hard lessons about money. When his financial struggles hit the headlines, the world was shocked because this was the man who once ruled the NBA.In an interview in 2025, AI sat down and talked about how popularity and money had people circling him at one point, but with depleting finances, the circle became smaller and smaller.He said, “Just because you love somebody don't mean they love you the same way,"" he said. ""I made so many mistakes trusting people that you think supposed to love you. I'm not talking about friends that you grew up with … I'm talking about even family. Money is really the root of all evil.""In late 2023, Allen Iverson was appointed as the vice president of basketball in Reebok with Shaquille O’Neal as its president. This move wasn't just ceremonial, it brought Iverson back into the fold to help relaunch the brand's basketball category for the 2025-2026 season. He also published a memoir in 2025, Misunderstood, that dived deep into his upbringing, childhood, basketball, and becoming a cultural icon.Also read: The 21-year old Anthony Black announced himself to Europe with a poster dunk in Berlin","Allen iverson has a $32 million trust fund courtesy of reebok.

Ashley St Clair, American writer and mother of Elon Musk’s son Romulus has sued the tech billionaire’s AI company xAI. In the lawsuit filed with the supreme court of the state of New York, Clair alleges that her explicit images were generated by AI chatbot Grok, including one in which she was underage. She further claims that the AI tool, integrated into X (formerly Twitter) – also owned by Elon Musk – promised to stop generating explicit images but continued to do so. Clair is seeking both punitive and compensatory damages from the company.The lawsuit comes days after the tech billionaire said that he will seek full custody of his one-year-old son with Clair. Responding to a user urging him for full custody, Musk wrote on X “I will be filing for full custody today, given her statements implying she might transition a one-year-old boy.”The lawsuit states that the social media company “retaliated against her, demonetising her X account and generating multitudes more images of her, including unlawful images of her in sex positions, covered in semen, virtually nude, and images of her as a child naked”.The filing further alleges that not only were the generated images nonconsensual, but “Grok and xAI also had explicit knowledge that St Clair was not consenting to the creation or dissemination of these images because of her requests for removal”.Ashley St Clair is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, a victims’ rights lawyer. In a statement to the Guardian, Goldberg said:“xAI is not a reasonably safe product and is a public nuisance. Nobody has born the brunt more than Ashley St Clair. Ashley filed suit because Grok was harassing her by creating and distributing nonconsensual, abusive, and degrading images of her and publishing them on X.“This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm. We intend to hold Grok accountable and to help establish clear legal boundaries for the entire public’s benefit to prevent AI from being weaponised for abuse.”",Ashley st clair is the mother of elon musk's one-year-old son romulus.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Bill Gates and his former -wife are among the top donators to the foundation. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion to the endowment through 2024. Warren Buffett, who is a former trustee and a clsowe friend of Gates donated $43.3 billion from 2006 to 2024.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget.To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year. That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Bill Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030 as global health indicators worsen.
