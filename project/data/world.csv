PM Modi likely to visit New York: UNGA address on cards; trip amid Trump tariff row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-likely-to-meet-trump-talks-expected-amid-tariff-row-meeting-to-take-place-at-unga-summit/articleshow/123269389.cms,"PM Modi with US President Donald Trump (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit the United States in September for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is to take place in New York City. PM Modi 's visit to Washington, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.Trump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff.The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska."" ""Further details to follow. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Putin’s trip to Alaska will be his first to the US in a decade. The last time Russia’s leader was in the country for a meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2015 with then-President Barack Obama.The announcement came just hours after Trump told reporters he planned to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine with Putin. The President expressed cautious optimism, saying he believes “we have a shot” at brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.The 80th session of the UNGA will open on September 9. The high-level General Debate will run from September 23-29, with Brazil as the traditional first speaker of the session, followed by the US.US President Donald Trump will address world leaders from the iconic UNGA podium on September 23, his first address to the UN session in his second term in the White House.","Pm narendra modi is expected to visit the united states in september for the united nations general assembly meeting.

"Journalists' articles, videos prima facie not sedition: Supreme Court says any good law can be misused or abused",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/any-good-law-can-be-misused-or-abused-supreme-court-journalists-articles-videos-prima-facie-not-sedition-says-top-court/articleshow/123268610.cms,"Any good law can be misused or abused: SC



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said on Tuesday that a journalist's news article or video is prima facie not an act endangering the unity and integrity of the country to invite a charge under Section 152 of BNS, the modified version of the 'sedition' offence under IPC Section 124A.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'The Wire', Siddharth Varadarajan, and members of the 'Foundation of Independent Journalism' in an FIR registered by Assam Police on a complaint accusing the editor of writing seditious articles by reporting about the alleged loss of IAF jets during Operation Sindoor . The scribe said he wrote the report quoting India's defence personnel, including the country's military attache to Indonesia.The bench said, ""For writing articles or preparing news videos, should journalists get entangled in cases? Should it require arrests?""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the petition filed by the journalist challenging the validity of Section 152 is a camouflage to avoid accountability.Justice Kant said, ""We are not classifying journalists as a separate class. However, does an article pose an imminent threat to the unity and integrity of the country? It is an article, not like someone is smuggling illegal arms and ammunition into India.""On the petitioners' allegation that Section 152 does not define which acts constitute an offence under the provision, Justice Kant said, ""How can it be legislatively defined as to which all acts would constitute an offence of endangering the unity and integrity of the country? Law has to be applied to facts of each case to determine whether the charge under Section 152 is correct. Inviting the legislature to define what endangers national unity and integrity will be inviting danger. ""Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan said they have also challenged the validity of BNS Section 152, which is nothing but a refined version of the draconian Section 124A, the operation of which was virtually stayed by SC pending adjudication of its validity by a five-judge bench.The court did not accept her second line of argument that Section 152 was prone to misuse and abuse by police. ""Is potential abuse or misuse of a provision of law by authorities a valid ground to declare that provision of law unconstitutional? There is a vast difference between implementation of a law and power to legislate,"" Justice Bagchi said.Justice Kant's response was similar. ""Any good law, declared constitutional by SC, can be misused or abused by police authorities. Should that be a ground to declare the law unconstitutional? SC ruling in the Kedar Nath Singh (1962 case) continues to hold the field and in which SC had ruled that the crime of sedition is restricted to 'actual violence or incitement to violence' against the govt.""Senior advocate Ramakrishnan said that the word 'sedition' is not there in Section 152 but for all other purposes the intent of the provision is identical to Section 124A and is being increasingly used to harass journalists.The bench reluctantly agreed to tag this petition with a petition by S G Vombatkere, who has also challenged the validity of Section 152 and whose earlier petition challenging Section 124A is pending adjudication.",A bench of justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi said this while protecting from arrest the editor of news website 'the wire' solicitor general tushar mehta said the petition filed by the journalist challenging the validity of section 152 is a camouflage to avoid accountability.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123268649,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57384,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Ahead of the upcoming meeting in Alaska between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a ceasefire deal, Vice President JD Vance expressed a clear desire to end the funding of the Ukraine war and bring about peace.""We're done with the funding of the Ukraine war business. We want to bring about a peaceful settlement to this thing,"" Vance told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" as reported by The Hill.The Alaska summit aims to find a breakthrough in peace negotiations with Moscow, focusing on discussions around territorial control. Earlier this week, the Kremlin shared a ceasefire proposal with the Trump administration, offering control of Eastern Ukraine in exchange for a halt to hostilities.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has strongly opposed the deal, insisting that any agreement that excludes Ukraine undermines the prospect of peace. Though Zelenskyy was not invited to the summit, the White House and US Ambassador to Nato Matthew Whitaker have indicated the possibility of a trilateral summit.European leaders have reacted strongly to the proposed agreement, promising to support Trump's efforts diplomatically, economically, and militarily, but stressed that any resolution must safeguard Ukraine's and Europe's vital security interests, according to The Hill.During the interview, Vance highlighted American frustration with the continued financial burden of the conflict. ""Americans, I think, are sick of continuing to send their money, their tax dollars of this particular conflict but if the Europeans want to step up and actually buy the weapons from American producers we're OK with that, but we're not going to fund it ourselves anymore,"" he said.This is not the first time Vance has called on European allies to take on a larger role. Earlier this year, Trump secured agreements for Nato members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP and arranged for the U.S. to send lethal weapons to Ukraine funded by other Nato countries, significantly expanding Europe's economic involvement in the conflict, The Hill noted.Vance recently traveled to England to discuss these peace efforts, urging European nations to ""step up and take a bigger role in this thing,"" adding, ""if you care so much about this conflict you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself.""",Us vice president jd vance said the u.s. wants to end the funding of the ukraine war and bring about peace. Vance spoke ahead of the upcoming meeting between us president donald trump and russian president vladimir putin.

NEW DELHI: In his bellicose speech where he threatened to nuke India, Pakistan army chief Asim Munir put a target on Reliance Industries Ltd's refinery - world's largest single-site refining complex - at Jamnagar in Gujarat in case of any future military conflict with New Delhi, indicating for the first time the intent to hit India's economic assets, especially oil installations.Speaking at a formal dinner at Tampa, Florida, in the US, Munir referred to a social media post with a Quranic verse along with the picture of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani to say he authorised it during the recent conflict with India ""to show them what we will do the next time"", media reports quoting those present at the closed-door event said.While this set off chatter about Munir threatening the richest Indian, with a net worth of over $115 billion heading the oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate, narration in the verse from Surah Al-Fil (The Elephant), the 105th chapter of the Quran, can be interpreted as an aerial attack in modern warfare.According to open source information, the verse refers to the 'Year of the Elephant, approximately (570 CE), when Abraha, the ruler of Yemen, led an army with elephants to destroy the Kaaba. Allah then sent flocks of birds carrying stones of baked clay, which struck and destroyed Abraha's army.India continuously evaluates military and other threats to its sensitive economic installations, especially those located in border states or considered within range of Pakistan air attacks.In the past, there have been separate reports from intelligence agencies about threats to such installations, particularly the RIL refinery, from Pakistan-based terror groups.Munir chose Ambani to make his threat because the RIL chief symbolises India's economic power and potential. Though there are other oil installations and assets that may be considered vulnerable, the sheer size of the Jamnagar complex makes it the showstopper in India's refining sector with an annual capacity of processing 33 million tonnes of crude, or 12% of India's total refining capacity. It is a major exporter of refined petroleum products.",Pakistan army chief asim munir put a target on reliance industries ltd's refinery in case of any future military conflict with new delhi.

Amid nuclear threats and war-related remarks by senior Pakistani leaders and its army chief Asim Munir, Islamabad has urged India to restart the ""normal functioning"" of the Indus Waters Treaty . New Delhi has kept the treaty in abeyance since May, after the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.Pakistan’s foreign office said it is committed to the full implementation of the treaty and welcomed the interpretation of the Court of Arbitration on the matter.The request came after Pakistan’s army chief, Asim Munir, issued a nuclear war warning and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto made statements calling for action over India’s position on the water-sharing agreement.In a statement on Monday, Pakistan’s foreign office said, ""Pakistan is committed to the full implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty and also expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the treaty.""It welcomed the interpretation related to the Indus Waters Treaty made by the Court of Arbitration on August 8.India has never recognised the proceedings at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, after Pakistan objected to certain design elements of two projects under the treaty.The Pakistan's foreign office claimed the award explains the design criteria for new run-of-river hydropower projects to be built by India on the Western Rivers — Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus.A day after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, India took several measures against Pakistan, including putting the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance.”""Pakistan expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the Treaty,"" the foreign ministry said in a post on X.Earlier, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday said that India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty is an attack on the Indus Valley civilisation and culture. ""The Indus Civilisation is connected to this river,"" he said, adding that an attack on the Indus River is an ""attack on our civilisation, our history, and our culture.""Meanwhile, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a strong statement in response to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff during his visit to the United States.

He visited the plane crash site in Ahmedabad.Talking to media persons, Andrews said that the families he met in the UK and India expressed a burning desire for answers, transparency, and information. Andrews said that the legal options available to the family will primarily be based on what data shows and what the investigation reveals.""We visited the crash site and spoke with some of the individuals who were there.

Andrews said that the data will give them an idea of which entity may or may not be responsible for the crash. He added that if Boeing is found to be responsible for this crash, the cases will be filed in the Federal court in the US. When asked about reports of a pilot error being responsible for the incident, Andrews said that more often than not, pilots who are deceased are the ones who are blamed.He added that in other incidents where the planes landed safely, the pilots were not blamed because those pilots can still speak for themselves.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir, during his second visit to the United States in two months and just months after Operation Sindoor , issued sharp anti-India remarks, declaring from US soil, ""if we think we are going down, we’ll take half the world down with us.""Munir also reportedly threatened Reliance Industries Ltd’s Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat, which is the largest single-site refining complex in the world, as a possible target in any future military conflict with India.A senior TOI source in New Delhi described the situation in Pakistan as dangerous, saying, ""The (Pakistan) army, which is led by a religious fanatic, having the control of the nuclear button, has usurped the control and undermines the authority of the civilian govt. The principles of checks and balances have been diluted leading to unpredictability and uncertainty.""Back in April, a Pakistan minister had openly stated, ""Pakistan’s arsenal — including Ghauri, Shaheen and Ghaznavi missiles along with 130 nuclear warheads, have been kept only for India.""Government sources said Pakistan has often threatened to use nuclear weapons against India, follows a ‘first-use’ policy, and even got nuclear technology through illegal means from abroad.In April, a Pakistani minister claimed its missiles and 130 nuclear warheads were “only for India,” while in May, its envoy to Russia warned of using “full” conventional and nuclear power.Officials warned that Pakistan’s mix of state-backed terrorism and extremist influence makes its nuclear weapons a danger not just to India but to the world. They recalled LeT chief Hafiz Saeed’s 2016 claim that these missiles could also target Israel and Western countries.They added that Pakistan calls relations with India a “nuclear flashpoint,” even though India has never made such threats — showing Pakistan’s intent to keep the nuclear option open.On Monday, the ministry of external affairs hit back strongly. Calling Munir's words ""nuclear sabre-rattling"" and ""Pakistan’s stock-in-trade,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was ""regrettable"" that such threats were made ""from the soil of a friendly third country (the US).""""India has already made it clear it will not give in to nuclear blackmail... and will take all steps to safeguard our national security,"" he said.Jaiswal described Munir’s remarks as ""irresponsible"" and said they reinforced ""the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.""Media reports say that during a formal dinner in Tampa, Florida, Munir referred to a social media post showing a Quranic verse alongside the picture of RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani.According to those present at the closed-door event, Munir claimed he had authorised the post during the recent conflict with India “to show them what we will do the next time.”Months after the Pahalgam terror attack triggered intense military escalation between India and Pakistan, Pakistan army chief Asim Munir has made provocative remarks.Following the attack, India retaliated with counterterror strikes, destroying multiple terror hubs inside Pakistan. In response, Pakistan launched drone and missile strikes, all of which were intercepted and neutralised by India’s air defence system.Just days ago, Indian Air Force chief described the Russian-made S-400 system as ""a game-changer,"" confirming that the IAF shot down six Pakistani aircraft during the confrontation.The standoff eventually eased after Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) contacted his Indian counterpart to agree on a peace arrangement.According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, India's military strength is far greater than Pakistan’s. India has around 1.4 million active military personnel, including 1.23 million in the Army, 75,500 in the Navy, 149,900 in the Air Force, and 13,350 in the Coast Guard.Pakistan’s active military stands at fewer than 700,000 -- with 560,000 in the army, 70,000 in the air force, and 30,000 in the navy. India also has a much larger paramilitary force (2.5 million personnel) compared to Pakistan’s roughly 500,000, giving India a stronger capacity for internal security and counterinsurgency operations.Both nations possess nuclear weapons, but for the first time in over 20 years, India is estimated to have more warheads -- about 180 compared to Pakistan's 170.India's nuclear modernisation includes Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) on Agni-V ballistic missiles, giving it the ability to hit multiple targets at once. With a range of 5,000 to 8,000 km, the Agni-V can reach across Asia, including China.Pakistan’s Shaheen-3 missile, still under development, has a range of about 2,750 km, covering all of India depending on launch location. Both countries are also working on a full nuclear triad -- the ability to launch nuclear weapons from land, sea, and air -- increasing the risks of escalation in the region.","'religious fanatic' in control of nuclear button, says senior toi source.

And once the dam is opened, it will lead to a tsunami without a single shot being fired. I apologise for saying this.

Poll Do you support the deport now, appeal later initiative for foreign criminals in the UK? Yes, it ensures quicker action No, it denies a fair legal process

LONDON: India is among 15 countries added to a list of eight whose nationals, when convicted of crimes in the UK, will no longer be able to delay their deportation by appealing against the decision to remove them.Under a “deport now, appeal later” initiative, they will be deported and have to take part in any hearing related to any appeal against deportation remotely from India via video link.Terrorists, murderers and those serving life sentences will continue to have to serve their prison sentence in Britain before being considered for deportation.Previously, offenders from the countries in question could remain in the UK for years while they appealed being deported under human rights laws. Indians who are deported are barred from re-entering the UK. Once back in their home country, it is up to India whether they are sent to prison or freed.Until now, the UK could deport foreign criminals from eight countries without appeal in the UK — namely Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania and Kosovo. The new countries added to the list are Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda and Zambia.The UK govt is in continuous discussions with other countries about joining the scheme.There are currently 320 Indian nationals in jail in England and Wales as of June 30, 2025, of which 310 are men and 10 are women.Most foreign prisoners can be deported after serving 30% of their prison time in the UK.Also read: ‘Deport now, appeal later’ scheme:;UK expands policy to 23 countries — Is India on the list?

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Russell Wilson's wife Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.","Grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.

Taylor Swift had once opened up about why she has been so public about her romance with Travis Kelce



Taylor Swift was extremely private about her relationship with Joe Alwyn, years before she met Travis Kelce



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been pretty public about their relationship ever since the two started dating in 2023. The two high profile stars never tried to hide their relationship and were always spotted in public holding hands as they went on their dates. In 2023, just months after Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce began dating, she opened up about why she is so public with the Kansas City Chiefs’ star player.In 2023, the billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift became the 2023 Time Person of the Year. The “Cruel Summer” singer spoke to TIME about her relationship with Travis Kelce and the reason behind their public romance.Taylor Swift said, “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care…”The billionaire pop star added, “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”Taylor Swift’s public romance with Travis Kelce is completely opposite to how she was with her ex boyfriends, including in her long relationship with Hollywood actor, Joe Alwyn.Taylor Swift has always been extremely protective of her romances and has always tried to keep them out of the public eye.Despite being together for six years, Taylor Swift and her ex boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, were hardly ever spotted together in public.The two were mostly seen hiding their faces and running away from cameras to avoid being linked together.With Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift is completely different as she is extremely public about their expensive date nights. The billionaire pop star shocked her fans when she arrived at the stadium in 2023 to cheer on Travis Kelce, just weeks after rumours of their romance had begun.Now, it’s been two years and Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are deeply in love with each other and are still going strong. While there are speculations about their engagement, neither of them have confirmed their future plans yet and have maintained complete privacy over their much speculated future.It seems the two are now in for a long haul and are trying to spend all their time with each other. Both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have also met each other's families and have often been spotted frequently hanging out in public. So it seems its only the inevitable that they would announce their future plans soon even though they are keeping things pretty private.Also Read: Selena Gomez opens up about Taylor Swift as the singer and Travis Kelce reportedly end all ties with Blake Lively","Taylor swift had opened up about her public romance with travis kelce.

“proud sexual assaulter”

Martina Navratilova responds to Trump’s recent accusations amid Epstein file controversy

US President Donald Trump's controversial statement about boxer Mike Tyson has resulted in Martina Navratilova, a tennis star, condemning him more recently. This occurred as Trump is under rising queries over his relationships with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who passed in prison in August 2019. The remark Trump made concerned Mike Tyson's 1992 rape conviction. Navratilova called out Trump for always defending men accused of sexual crimes, calling him a “proud sexual assaulter and an adjudicated rapist.”Six years in jail was Mike Tyson's sentence in 1992 when he was convicted of raping a beauty pageant candidate aged 18. Donald Trump then surprised several by claiming the penalty was too severe on Late Night with David Letterman. Trump also accused the young woman, claiming she was ""dancing at his door at one o'clock in the morning."" These phrases enraged people since they looked to absolve Tyson's crime.Years later, in August 2025, an X (previously Twitter) user reposted Trump's previous remarks. Having been very vocal against Trump for years, Martina Navratilova saw this and reacted strongly.She wrote on X that Trump has always made excuses for rapists like Tyson.

Trump called the situation “a hoax” and accused those leaders of trying to hurt him. This was reported by American lawyer Ron Filipkowski on X.Martina Navratilova responded to Filipkowski's post by saying Trump's assertions demonstrate his ""fear.""

""It's crazy just to see John's impact has pretty much reached worldwide,"" she said, touched by such kindness as friends asking wedding guests to donate instead of giving gifts.The John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation is more than just a memorial; it is a continuation of the generosity of the two brothers and will inspire generations on and off the ice.Also Read: Chad Ruhwedel announces retirement from NHL after a steady 11-year career It is through the mandate of this foundation that Meredith and Madeline Gaudreau ensure that John and Matthew’s love of hockey, generosity, and commitment to aid and uplift fellow human beings will go on changing lives for years to come.","Johnny and matthew gaudreau died on august 29, 2024, when an alleged drunk driver ran them over while they were out cycling in new jersey.
