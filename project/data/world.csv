While India and Malaysia will look to ramp up trade and defence ties during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend, the issue of fugitive Zakir Naik’s extradition is also likely to be raised by the Indian side. The visit is likely to see signing of several MoUs, including one for cooperation with Malaysia’s thriving semiconductor industry.“We have had opportunities to discuss the issue in past visits also at various levels. And, we will probably continue to take up the issue until all technical procedures are completed, and we hope to get the outcome that we desire,” said MEA secretary (east) P Kumaran, responding to a question about Naik.India and Malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as Malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration. The official said that Modi and his counterpart Anwar Ibrahim will review progress under the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, especially in priority areas of cooperation such as trade, investments, defence, security, semiconductors, digital technologies, renewable energy, education, healthcare, and people-to-people exchanges.Kumaran also underlined the potential for defence cooperation between the two countries, saying that India is looking at sale of Dornier aircraft to Malaysia. “Malaysia also has Scorpene submarines. We are looking at opportunities to try and collaborate, especially in terms of mid-life upgrades, retrofitting etc,” said the official.","India and malaysia have an extradition treaty, but the case, as malaysia maintains, will be resolved based on judicial consideration.

PM slams Cong for eroding global trust

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Thursday celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the EU and the US, saying the pacts augur well for world’s “stability and pace of progress” and were evidence of the international community regarding India as trusted trading partner.“When the trade deal with the EU took place, the world became more confident of stability. After the deal with the US, the world has more confidence in not just stability but also pace of progress... It is a good sign for the world... The biggest beneficiaries (from the deals) will be the youth of the country,” he said.Modi’s remarks in Rajya Sabha, during the debate on the motion of thanks on the President’s address, came even as the treaty with the US is yet to be formally signed. It’s being seen as an indication that the two sides may have resolved their differences. The formal announcement of the deal is likely next week.Modi slammed the party for its failure to secure similar trade pacts during its tenure and said it’ll have to one day respond to what it had done to India that other countries weren’t willing to do trade deals.The 97-minute fiery speech that started amid sloganeering from a protesting opposition, saw PM hitting out at Congress for the erosion of trust of foreign partners in India’s capacity to deliver and saying that a lot of his energy was spent on rectifying the mistakes of past Congress-led govts to instill confidence globally.Modi also highlighted investments in emerging sectors such as AI, quantum computing, critical minerals, space technology and deep-sea exploration, describing them as pillars of India’s growth strategy. He called for a push towards quality manufacturing, innovation and research.He said Congress was more focused on “vote bank politics” and did not prioritise economic issues. “Neither did they have a vision or will. That is the reason that the country had to suffer so much,” the PM said.“I can see very clearly that the second quarter of the 21st century is going to be critical for India’s progress at a rapid pace towards achieving the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Therefore, we have to only keep moving forward and not look back,” said Modi.The opposition protest at the beginning of Modi’s speech came as Congress and others alleged that Leader of the Opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge wanted to speak but was denied permission by chairman C P Radhakrishnan. While Modi kept speaking undeterred initially amid the protest, he paused and took a dig at Kharge, suggesting that he can keep raising slogans while sitting. The opposition later walked out of the House.Continuing with his speech, the PM said, “India is signing future-ready trade deals with several nations. In the last few days, we have signed trade deals with nine big nations, including the ‘mother of all deals’ with the 27-nation EU bloc.”Reflecting on the changing global population profile — where the world’s most developed countries are witnessing a fast-aging population — Modi said India is uniquely placed due to its youth population. “Having a large youth population is in itself a big attest. We have a very precious ‘youth talent pool’ that has dreams, resolve and capability to achieve their dreams,” Modi said.",Pm modi celebrated the signing of the trade deals with the eu and the us.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

CHENNAI: When IndiGo’s flight operations went topsy-turvy in December last year, there were videos and photos of hapless and tired passengers confronting ground staff. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has now put a number to their faces.The directorate’s monthly traffic data for Dec 2025 says 16.2 lakh domestic flyers were stranded at airports across the country due to the non-availability of either IndiGo aircraft or their crew members. The number of people affected due to total cancellation of flights was 9.8 lakh, while those stranded at the airports due to delays beyond two hours were 6.4 lakh.Simultaneously, 43,278 flyers who had booked flights on Air India and Air India Express were affected due to cancellation of flights. The number of passengers affected due to delays beyond two hours was almost 1.2 lakh.DGCA prepared the traffic report based on information received from the respective domestic airlines. IndiGo spent about Rs 22.7 crore on refunds, alternate flights and other facilitation in the same month, it said. The airline, however, said it cannot share details about the number of passengers eligible for compensation and the number compensated so farAt a Jan 29 meeting to review IndiGo’s operations, the airline assured that it would be good to fly without any disruption, even with the removal of exemptions to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations from Feb 10 onwards, as they now have sufficient pilots on the roster.Civil aviation expert Captain M Ranganathan said the problem is yet far from over. “For each domestic flight, an airline should have six pairs of pilots and co-pilots, and for long-haul flights there should be 11 pairs. The pilot availability they submitted is based on DGCA’s civil aviation requirements (CAR) regulations 2022. For their present fleet, there will still be a deficiency of pilots under new regulations. There is another storm brewing if the problem is not addressed,” he said.Several pilots told TOI the biggest problem was poor pay. “Pilots’ salary is very low in India compared to other countries, and pilots are among the highest taxpayers,” said a pilot.",The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has now put a number to their faces.

'India Open To Explore Commercial Merits Of Venezuela Oil Import': MEA On Trump's Russian Oil Claim

'Nothing unusual in Indian position': Russia

'Evolving internal dynamics': Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: Ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Thursday said India’s energy security remained the government’s top priority, responding to claims by US President Donald Trump that India may stop buying Russian oil and instead source crude from countries such as the United States and Venezuela.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India’s decisions on oil imports are guided by national interest and evolving global conditions.“The government has stated publicly on several occasions that ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion Indians is the supreme priority of our government. Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this. All of India’s decisions were taken and will be taken with this in mind,” he said.His remarks came after Trump claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases as part of a broader trade understanding, and that India could increase imports from the US and possibly Venezuela. However, India has not publicly confirmed any such commitment.Jaiswal also addressed questions about Venezuela, describing it as a long-standing energy partner for India, while noting that sanctions have affected imports.“As far as Venezuela is concerned, it has been a long-standing partner for India. We were importing crude oil until 2019, after which purchases stopped due to sanctions. Imports resumed briefly between 2023 and 2024, but had to be halted again because of sanctions,” he said.He added that Indian public sector companies have existing ties in Venezuela’s energy sector and that India remains open to future options.“Indian PSUs have established partnerships with international oil companies operating in Venezuela. Consistent with our approach to energy security, India remains open to exploring the commercial merits of any crude supply options, including those from Venezuela.”Russia on Wednesday said India was free to buy crude oil from any supplier and that its efforts to diversify energy imports were not new.""We, along with all other international energy experts, are well aware that Russia is not the only supplier of oil and petroleum products to India. India has always purchased these products from other countries. Therefore, we see nothing new here,"" Peskov said.Peskov added that Russia had not received any official communication from India on stopping imports of Russian oil.Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova also defended the energy trade between the two countries, describing it as mutually beneficial.Union minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said India’s energy security remained the government’s top priority, responding to claims by US President Donald Trump.On choice of oil suppliers, the minister said: “Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this.

'India Open To Explore Commercial Merits Of Venezuela Oil Import': MEA On Trump's Russian Oil Claim

NEW DELHI: Amid claims by the US that India has agreed to stop purchasing Russian crude, the govt reiterated Thursday that diversifying energy sourcing in line with market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of India’s energy security strategy. In keeping with the same, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) added it is open to exploring the possibility of crude supplies from Venezuela.US President Donald Trump had said earlier this week that India had agreed to buy a lot more energy from the US and also potentially from Venezuela.The MEA said Venezuela had been a long-standing partner of India in the energy sector, encompassing trade and investments.“The country was among India’s major sources of crude oil until FY 2019-20, which were discontinued following sanctions. Imports from Venezuela resumed in FY 2023-24, before being halted again due to the re-imposition of sanctions,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, adding that Indian PSUs have had a partnership with Venezuela’s national oil company and have been maintaining a presence in Venezuela since 2008.“Consistent with India’s approach to energy security, India remains open to exploring the commercial merits of any new crude supply options, including from Venezuela,” said the official.On India’s energy sourcing, the official recalled that govt had stated publicly on several occasions that ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion Indians was the supreme priority of govt.“Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this. All of India’s actions are taken and will be taken with this in mind,” he said.Announcing a trade deal with India, the White House had said this week that the US was bringing down its tariff on India from 50% to 18%. The official recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had noted ‘Made-in-India’ products will now be exported to the US at a reduced tariff of 18%.“This trade agreement will give a major boost to India’s export, labour intensive industries, job creation, growth and bring prosperity to our people. The US side has also clarified that the final figure of tariff is 18%,” said Jaiswal.",Us president donald trump had said earlier this week that india had agreed to buy a lot more energy from the us and also potentially from venezuela.

And he conveyed support for the FORGE (Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement) initiative that has been set in motion post this Critical Minerals Partnership,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.During his visit, Jaishankar also had a bilateral meeting with Rubio, which saw the leaders welcoming the trade deal and stressing the importance of the two democracies working together to unlock new economic opportunities and advance their shared energy security goals.According to the US state department, the leaders concluded their meeting by expressing their commitment to expanding bilateral and multilateral cooperation through the Quad. “They acknowledged that a prosperous Indo-Pacific region remains vital to advancing our shared interests,” said the US readout. The fact that both countries seem to have finally resolved their differences over trade has also raised hopes of an early visit to India by President Donald Trump for the Quad summit, which India would like to host as soon as possible.","Jaishankar said the deal opens up a new phase in india-us bilateral ties.

However, he did not provide any evidence of opposition chanting the slogan.""They are moving with the mantra of 'Modi teri kabr khudegi'. They dream of this and speak of democracy.

They believe that the Prime Minister’s post belongs to their family as a matter of right.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday struck a mix of humour and sharp political attack as he revealed his ""health secret"" during his much-anticipated speech in the Rajya Sabha delivered amid sloganeering and a walkout by opposition members.Addressing the House, the Prime Minister said, ""...Someone once asked me, 'Modi ji, what is the secret of your good health?'

World Praises India-US Trade Deal: PM Modi Tells Rajya Sabha Youth Will Gain Global Opportunities

Top quotes from the speech:

A significant part of our energy is being spent on correcting the mistakes of the past. It takes great effort to erase the image that was created in the minds of the world during that period, they left things in such a damaged state. That is why we have placed strong emphasis on future-ready policies. Today, the country is being governed on the basis of policy and strategy. Global trust in India is growing. Guided by the mantra of ‘reform, perform, transform,’ we have moved forward, and the reality today is that the nation has boarded the Reform Express.

This Congress party has also betrayed farmers. Our country has around 10 crore farmers who own less than two hectares of land. Congress never cared for them, but we felt their pain; therefore, we introduced the PM Kisan Yojana.

Colleagues from TMC said a lot of things. But they should look within themselves. A cruel government is making new records in all the parameters of downfall. But they are lecturing us here...Future of the people there is plunging into darkness but they (State Govt) do not care. They have no aspirations besides being in power. They are lecturing here. Prosperous nations of the world are driving out illegal residents from their country. But in our country, pressure is being put on the courts. How can the youth of our nation forgive such people who are using everything possible to advocate for the infiltrators?

One of the MPs was saying a lot of things. His entire government is drowning in liquor. Their 'sheeshmahal' became a reason for hatred in every household...Be it Congress, TMC, DMK, Left - they were in power at the Centre for decades. They were also in power in states. But during their time, Bofors was mentioned when deals were discussed

I am speaking about Assam, and no one should think that I am saying this because of elections. I am compelled to speak because of their (Opposition) failures. The Congress only imagines things; it has little to do with implementation. The Bogibeel bridge project in Assam was stalled for many years. Through a focus on progress, we reviewed it and completed a major project that has become a significant facility not just for Assam but for the entire Northeast.

I heard the discussion, I felt that the level of discussion should have been a little higher, especially from that side (Opposition side). They have been part of the government for years. The level of discussion from that side should have been a little higher. But they lost even this opportunity

Big countries are very eager to have trade relations with India. Be it the trade deal of the European Union or the recent deal with the US. The entire world is openly praising these trade deals. When we signed the trade deal with the EU, the world became more confident about the greater likelihood of global stability. After the trade deal with the US, the world became even more confident that with stability, they can sense a speed too. This is a positive sign for the world.

Today, India is a trusted partner of several nations and we are playing our role towards welfare of the world. Today, the entire world speaks of Global South but as the main character of that discussion, today India has emerged as a strong voice of Global South on global platforms.

but as the main character of that discussion, today India has emerged as a strong voice of Global South on global platforms. India is signing future-ready trade deals with several countries. In the past few days, we signed trade deals with 9 big and important countries of the world. Mother of all deals with 27 countries, with European Union is one of them.

The first quarter of the 21st century has completed. But this second quarter is decisive just like the second quarter of India's freedom struggle in the last century was. I can clearly see that in the direction of building Viksit Bharat, this second quarter is going to be equally capable.

Shashi Tharoor Claims India 'Surrendered' To US Pressure By Stopping Chabahar Port Fund in Budget

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has criticised The Washington Post’s decision to lay off his son, foreign affairs columnist Ishaan Tharoor, describing it as a “perverse act of self-immolation”.Reacting on X, Tharoor wrote: “The bizarre thing about this so-called ‘business decision’ by The Washington Post is that @ishaantharoor’s column flourished on the Internet,” adding that Ishaan Tharoor had “500,000 (half a million plus!) individual subscribers” for his WorldView newsletter. He said he had met foreign ministers, diplomats and scholars around the world who read the newsletter daily, and argued that the newspaper could have tried monetising that reach instead of abolishing it.Ishaan Tharoor was among those laid off as part of a major restructuring at The Washington Post that affected around 300 employees and significantly reduced the newspaper’s international coverage. Several international correspondents and editors also announced their exits on social media.In a post on X, Ishaan Tharoor said he had been laid off along with much of the international staff, adding that he was “heartbroken” for the newsroom and colleagues he had worked with over nearly 12 years. In a separate post, he called it “a bad day” and shared an image of an empty newsroom. He also wrote about launching WorldView in 2017 and thanked the newsletter’s roughly half-a-million subscribers.The Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos . The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging continued investment in the newspaper’s journalism.The layoffs at The Washington Post are part of a wider restructuring that has seen the paper sharply scale back its global and national reporting operations. Around 300 employees were affected across departments, with the international desk among the hardest hit.As part of the overhaul, the Post has reduced its foreign bureaus and eliminated several international reporting roles, effectively shrinking its on-the-ground presence in regions including the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Multiple senior correspondents and editors confirmed their exits publicly, some noting that entire regional teams had been disbanded.The restructuring has also led to the winding down or closure of several editorial initiatives, including podcasts and specialist sections, as management seeks to cut costs and refocus resources amid sustained financial pressure on US legacy newsrooms.The Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has faced declining digital subscriptions and advertising revenue in recent years, prompting repeated rounds of cost-cutting. The newspaper’s union has warned that continued reductions to reporting staff risk undermining its journalistic mission, particularly its ability to cover international affairs comprehensively.The current round of layoffs marks one of the most significant contractions of the Post’s global reporting footprint in its modern history, signalling a strategic retreat from expansive international coverage at a time of heightened geopolitical instability.","Ishaan tharoor was among those laid off as part of a major restructuring at the washington post.

As the session began, the opposition women MPs surrounded the PM's chair displaying posters in protest. The House was adjourned amid ruckus and speech was eventually cancelled.PM Modi is now likely to address the Rajya Sabha, where the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address has proceeded without any interruptions.Congress invoked a 2004 precedent to counter current criticism, recalling that then prime minister Manmohan Singh was stopped by the BJP from replying to the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address on June 10 that year.""To recall and remind - on June 10 2004, the Prime Minister was prevented by the BJP from speaking on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address,"" Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X.He also shared an old video of Manmohan speech the subsequent year when he said in the House that it was a ""hard earned privilege for me since I have had to wait out the entire year to perform this happy task.""“Mr Speaker, Sir, | deem it a great privilege to be standing here today to express the gratitude of our Government to the respected Rashtrapatiji for his address to Members of both Houses of Parliament.
