NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23, prolonging the restrictions for another month amid continuing tensions between the two countries.The Pakistan Airports Authority confirmed the move in a fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), stating, “All aircraft operated by Indian airlines will not be allowed to use Pakistani airspace. The ban also remains in place for military and civilian aircraft that are Indian-owned or leased.”The restrictions were first imposed on April 23 for one month following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India retaliated on April 30 by announcing a reciprocal closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines.Since then, both sides have repeatedly extended the curbs. On May 23, Pakistan prolonged its ban after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. Another NOTAM later extended the closure from June 23 to July 24, stating, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The tit-for-tat measures have left carriers from both countries barred from flying over each other’s territory, with every extension keeping the restrictions in place.",Pakistan extends airspace ban on indian aircraft until september 23.

India must keep tight vigil along LAC: Army officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-must-keep-tight-vigil-along-lac-army-officials/articleshow/123420651.cms,"Many PLA arms brigades still remain forward deployed



New Delhi: India will militarily have to be extremely alert on the ground if long-drawn de-escalation process with China kicks off in the coming months amid the ongoing Sino -Indian detente, against the backdrop of PLA having the requisite infrastructure in place to return swiftly to forward locations along the frontier.""The way China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire LAC, from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal, over the last five years, PLA troops can easily afford to pull back 100-150km and then come back again in 2-3 hours,"" a senior Army officer told TOI.Our forces cannot. This huge time differential in mobilisation between the rival forces will have to be factored in during any de-escalation talks,a senior Army officer said.To be sure, India and China have as yet only decided to “discuss de-escalation, beginning with the principles and modalities thereof” during Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit this week. On the ground, the trust deficit between the rival armies, which have remained forward deployed with heavy weapons all along the 3,488-km LAC after multiple PLA incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020, remains “quite high”, though the situation is no longer on hair-trigger alert as before.The situation has stabilised after troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok last Oct. “There is no disruption in the coordinated patrolling by the rival soldiers there. But we cannot let our guard down since there has been no let-up in the PLA’s military preparedness and infrastructure build-up,” another officer said.While some of the PLA’s combined arms brigades have pulled back around 100 km from the LAC over the last few months, many still remain forward deployed along with its border defence regiments. Each CAB has around 4,500-5,000 soldiers with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapon systems.De-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC will entail the return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations. The two countries, meanwhile, are using existing border management mechanisms at the diplomatic and military levels to maintain peace along the LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. To this end, the two sides have now also decided to set up “general-level mechanisms” in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC, to add to the existing talks mechanism between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief in western (Ladakh) one.From the Indian side, it is likely to be the Lt-General commanding the Uttar Bharat (UB) Area based in Bareilly, which has been “combatised”, in the middle sector. Similarly, in the eastern one, it could be the Lt-Generals commanding the Dimapur-based 3 Corps or the Tezpur-based 4 Corps.In eastern Ladakh, the immediate priority would be the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” on patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, Kailash Range and larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3 km to 10 km, which came up on what India considers to be its own territory. But there has been no movement on the issue since then.","China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire lac. Pla troops can easily afford to pull back 100-150km and then come back again in 2-3 hours. This huge time differential in mobilisation between the rival forces will have to be factored in during any de-escalation talks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123420696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1528221,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Russia-Ukraine war: Did Donald Trump impose 'sanctions on India' to pressure Moscow? What White House said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/russia-ukraine-war-donald-trump-imposed-additional-tariffs-on-india-to-apply-secondary-pressure-on-moscow-white-house/articleshow/123396914.cms,"File photo: US press secretary Karoline Leavitt (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump imposed steep additional tariffs on Indian goods as part of efforts to push Russia towards ending the conflict in Ukraine, the White House said on Tuesday.Trump had doubled India’s tariffs to 50 per cent by adding an extra 25 per cent duty on top of the previously announced rate, which will take effect from August 27.Addressing reporters, US press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Look, the president has put tremendous public pressure to bring this war to a close. He’s taken actions, as you’ve seen, sanctions on India and other actions as well”, adding that the intent was to apply “secondary pressure” on Moscow.The move comes just days after Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, where both leaders signalled progress towards a potential trilateral dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump described the talks as “a very successful day”, while Zelenskyy called it the “best conversation” he had held with the US president so far.Also read: White House defends Donald Trump's record, says 'held Russia in check and ensured peace in Europe' As per news agency ANI, Leavitt stressed that Trump was determined to speed up peace efforts.“The president wants to move and he wants to bring this war to an end as quickly as possible,” she said, noting that European leaders and Nato chiefs who visited Washington after Trump’s recent meeting with Putin also viewed the talks as a “great first step”.She further claimed that European leaders were “very grateful” for Trump’s readout of Russia’s position, saying, “something that was not done by the previous administration at all.”On trade implications, Indian refiners have begun holding back on September-loading Russian oil tenders until there is clarity on the penalties. Executives warned that replacing Russian crude quickly would be difficult, as it makes up about 35 per cent of India’s imports. “If such a large supply disappears from the market, it will create tension and lead to price increases,” one industry official said.Leavitt also repeated Trump’s long-standing claim that the war would never have begun had he been in office, adding that Putin himself had agreed. “True. Do you accept that as true? The European leaders do. Well, and President Putin himself said that, by the way,” she remarked when asked by a reporter.She emphasised that Trump was discussing long-term security guarantees with Nato and European partners. “He understands the need for that … He has expended an incredible amount of time, energy and effort into bringing this war to an end, and he remains determined to do that,” she said.","Trump had doubled india’s tariffs to 50 per cent by adding an extra 25 per cent duty on top of the previously announced rate.

After Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh killed three taking a wrong turn with his semi-truck in Florida, the Donald Trump administration dug out all his previous records and it's now confirmed that he was arrested by the Border Patrol two days after he illegally entered the country through California in 2018. Harjinder Singh's immigrant proceedings are pending following his arrest on September 20, 2018, said the Department of Homeland Security.When he was arrested in 2018, he was processed for expedited removal but he claimed at that time that he was scared to return to India. Fox News reported that his fear was affirmed by US Citizenship and Immigration Services and he was released on a $5,000 immigration bond.Singh was arrested after three people were killed near Fort Pierce on the Florida Turnpike on August 12. All three of them were in a minivan. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene, and the driver, a 30-year-old man from Florida City, later died in the hospital.Singh was arrested by US Marshals in California on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with a deadly crash in Florida, according to Fox News. Under Florida law, vehicular homicide is a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.After the video recorded inside the semi-truck went viral, Indians were attacked for driving mishaps on US roads and after Singh was found to be an illegal alien from India, the incident became a major political flashpoint.DHS said Singh stated that he does not have a serious physical or mental medical condition, has ""no known immediate relatives serving in the US military and is not the primary caretaker of a person with mental or physical disability, a minor or person with a serious illness."" Singh is also unmarried, has no minor dependent children and is not a victim of domestic violence or human trafficking -- factors that could have stopped his immediate deportation.""After careful consideration of all factors and available records, Singh is considered a significant threat to public safety and is an exceptional circumstance warranting enforcement action due to the serious nature of his criminal history,"" DHS said.",Indian-origin truck driver harjinder singh who killed three in florida said in 2018 he was scared to go back to india. 3 people were killed near fort pierce on the florida turnpike on august 12.

Poll How should neighbours handle long-standing tensions? Through peaceful dialogue Through strong retaliation

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday reiterated India's stand that it was a call from Pakistan's DGMO and not US President Donald Trump which led to the pause in India's Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.Thaoor said it was India's successful strikes on the intervening night of May 9-10 that prompted Pakistan to seek peace, as the operation ""sent a very clear message that we [India] will not sit quietly if terror is unleashed on us"".After Operation Sindoor, as the tension escalated, the Indian forces stepped up the retaliation against Pakistan -- bombing the Rahim Yar Khan Pakistani Air Force (PAF) base in Pakistan's southern Punjab region and Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi.""The successful strikes on the night of 9-10 May and the ability of India to intercept the attempted Pakistani response, when they sent missiles to Delhi on the morning of 10th May, is what contributed undoubtedly, and not Mr Trump, to the call by the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart asking for peace,"" Thaoor was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Speaking at the launch of his book ""Whither India-Pakistan Relations Today? Can They Ever Be Good Neighbours?"" Tharoor said that India has little inclination to make the first move in repairing ties with Pakistan after decades of disappointments, insisting that the responsibility now lies with Islamabad to dismantle terror networks operating from its soil.He said, ""At the end of the day, India did not have very much choice on how to react to all this.A couple of days after Pahalgam, I wrote an op-ed advocating precisely this. You can imagine my satisfaction and semi-disbelief that I didn't realise anyone in Delhi would be reading my op-ed, which is why I was such an enthusiastic supporter of it. It followed exactly the course of action I had advised in my op-ed. With Balakot in 2019 and Operation Sindoor now, India has sent a very clear message that we will not sit quietly if terror is unleashed on us. ""The Thiruvananthapuram MP argued that successive Indian attempts at outreach, from Jawaharlal Nehru’s pact with Liaqat Ali Khan in 1950, to Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Lahore bus journey in 1999, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lahore stopover in 2015, were each “betrayed” by hostility from across the border.“Given the record of Pakistani behaviour, the onus is on them. They’re the ones who have to take the first steps to show some sincerity about dismantling terror infrastructure on their soil. Why can’t they be serious about shutting down these terror camps? Everyone knows where they are. The UN committee has a list of 52 names of individuals, organisations and places in Pakistan. It’s not that Pakistan doesn’t know they exist,” Tharoor was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He pressed for “serious intent,” urging Islamabad to “shut them down, arrest some of these characters.” India, he added, would be willing to reciprocate but “won’t take the first step now.”Recalling the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, Tharoor said New Delhi had submitted “overwhelming evidence” of Pakistani involvement, from live intercepts to dossiers, yet “not one mastermind has been prosecuted.” He pointed out that India had shown “extraordinary restraint” despite repeated provocations, which eventually gave way to surgical strikes in 2016 and “Operation Sindoor.”“In my book Pax Indica, which was published in 2012, I had warned that if there was ever another Mumbai-like attack of comparable impact, with clear evidence of Pakistani complicity, the restraint we had shown in 2008 might become impossible and all bets would be off. And indeed, that is exactly what happened. No democratic government, least of all in India with its long record of betrayals by Pakistan, could sit idle while its neighbour assaults its civilians and innocent holidaymakers with impunity,” he said.Tharoor further said that “peace and tranquillity on the borders is indispensable to our national interest,” citing how France and Germany reconciled after World War II, and how the United States eventually normalised ties with Vietnam, as examples of adversaries becoming partners.The discussion also featured former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, former Indian ambassador to Pakistan T. C. A. Raghavan, former Army chief General Deepak Kapoor, and academic Amitabh Mattoo.",Senior congress leader shashi tharoor reiterates india's stand that it was a call from pakistan's dgmo and not us president donald trump which led to the pause in india's operation sindoor against pakistan.

NEW DELHI: On a visit to Moscow, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has suggested measures to further expand the trade relationship and to address the trade deficit of $58.9 billion that has resulted from India's increased oil procurement from Russia. The minister said this trade imbalance needed to be addressed urgently.Ahead of Jaishankar's meeting with his counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Thursday, Russia said in a statement that the main emphasis would be on promoting transportation, logistics, banking and financial chains independent from countries imposing sanctions, as well as expanding the use of national currencies in mutual settlements.Addressing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, removing bottlenecks in logistics, promoting connectivity, effecting payment mechanisms smoothly and early conclusion of the India-Eurasian Economic Union FTA, whose terms of reference were finalised on Wednesday, were some of the measures he suggested to diversify trade relations and address the imbalance.Also read: Russia: Oil supply to go on, 'special system' to deal with sanctions ""They will not only help to address the imbalance and grow our trade, but also hasten the timely achievement of our revised trade target of $100 billion by 2030,"" said Jaishankar, co-chairing the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission for Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGC-TEC) with Russia's first deputy PM Denis Manturov.Jaishankar called for promoting connectivity through the International North-South Transport Corridor, the Northern Sea Route and the Chennai-Vladivostok Corridor, and also sought timely finalisation and execution of the Programme of Economic Cooperation till 2030.Also read: Trump’s 25% additional tariffs loom: Indian refiners delay orders for Russian crude oil; take cautious approach On Thursday, Jaishankar will hold talks with Lavrov during which both sides will discuss regional and global issues, including developments related to the Russia-Ukraine war.

India tests its most formidable Agni-5 missile,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-its-most-formidable-agni-5-missile/articleshow/123413406.cms,"NEW DELHI: India successfully tested its most formidable nuclear-capable Agni-5 ballistic missile, which has a strike range of over 5,000-km to reach even the northernmost parts of China, from the integrated test range at Chandipur in Odisha on Wednesday.“The launch validated all operational and technical parameters. It was carried out under the aegis of the Strategic Forces Command (SFC),” the defence ministry said in a brief statement.The test comes over a year after the Agni-5 was tested for the first time with a multiple-warhead capability or MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) technology under 'Mission Divyastra' on March 11, 2024.It will take a few years for the Agni-5 with MIRV to become operational after multiple tests. A MIRV payload basically means a single missile carrying three-four nuclear warheads, each programmed to be released at different speeds with different trajectories to hit different targets that can be hundreds of kms apart.As of now, the tri-Service SFC, which was established in 2003 to handle the country’s nuclear arsenal, only has single-warhead ballistic missiles in its arsenal.They range from the Pakistan-specific Prithvi-2 (350-km strike range) and Agni-1 (700-km) missiles to Agni-2 (2,000-km), Agni-3 (3,000-km) and the near ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) Agni-5, which are largely geared towards China.“The test of the solid-fuelled, three-stage Agni-5 on Wednesday was a routine training trial carried out periodically by the SFC of already inducted missiles,” an official said.Significantly, the Agni-5 is a canister-launch missile, with a mated warhead in a ready-to-fire configuration. The hermetically-sealed canisters, while protecting the missiles from the environment, give the SFC the requisite operational flexibility to store them for long periods, swiftly transport them through rail or road, and fire it from wherever they want.India is also steadily working towards strengthening its nuclear triad, with the naval leg set to be augmented with the commissioning of a third SSBN (nuclear-powered submarine armed nuclear ballistic missiles) as INS Aridhaman this year. The first two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, are already operational.Parallelly, DRDO and the SFC have also been conducting “pre-induction night trials” of the new-generation and canister-launch Agni-Prime ballistic missile, which has a strike range from 1,000 to 2,000-km and will gradually replace the Agni-1 and Agni-2 missiles in the country’s nuclear arsenal.China, of course, has ICBMs like the DongFeng-5 and DF-41 with ranges over 12,000-km. It is also adding around 100 nuclear warheads every year to its existing stockpile of 600 warheads.As per the latest assessment by the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) released in June, China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster than any other country and is likely to touch 1,500 warheads by 2035. India, in turn, has 180 warheads and Pakistan 170.","India successfully tested its most formidable nuclear-capable agni-5 ballistic missile.

Why Pakistan is on edge

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday successfully test-fired its nuclear-capable intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) Agni-5 from the integrated test range (ITR) at Chandipur in Odisha, the defence ministry said.The launch, conducted on August 20, 2025, under the strategic forces command, validated all operational and technical parameters of the missile. Defence officials said the test was part of routine user trials aimed at ensuring the system’s readiness.Developed by the defence research and development organisation (DRDO), Agni-5 is among India’s most advanced long-range missiles with a range of over 5,000 kilometres. Equipped with modern navigation, guidance, warhead and propulsion technologies, it strengthens India’s nuclear deterrence.The ministry said the successful test reaffirms India’s commitment to maintaining a “credible minimum deterrence posture.”India’s test has raised alarms in Islamabad. The Strategic Vision Institute (SVI), a Pakistan-based think tank, has warned Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and army chief Asim Munir that India’s missile programme poses “serious risks” to regional stability.The SVI noted that India’s missile development accelerated after it joined the missile technology control regime (MTCR) in 2016, gaining access to advanced systems.It warned that with future variants exceeding 8,000 km range, India could potentially target cities as far as Washington, Moscow and Beijing.Pakistan’s concerns also extend to India’s growing naval nuclear arsenal, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles. According to the think tank, the Agni-5 test signals India’s global strategic ambitions and calls for international pressure on New Delhi to “refrain from destabilising moves” and pursue dialogue instead.","Agni-5 is a land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm) with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (mirv) capability.

‘India Profiting From Russian Oil’: Scott Bessent Hits Out Again Over Arbitrage, But Backs China

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Wednesday dismissed concerns raised by Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus , clarifying that India does not permit political activities targeting other countries from its soil and calling Dhaka's remarks ""misplaced.""MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in an official statement: ""The Government of India is not aware of any anti-Bangladesh activities by purported members of Awami League in India or of any action that is contrary to Indian law.""He added, ""The Government does not allow political activities against other countries to be carried out from Indian soil.""Describing the Yunus government’s statement as ""misplaced,"" Jaiswal further reflected on Bangladesh's upcoming polls: ""India reiterates its expectation that free, fair and inclusive elections will be held at the earliest in Bangladesh to ascertain the will and mandate of the people.""According to Bangladesh news portal BSS, Dhaka earlier urged India to take immediate action to shut down political offices of the banned Bangladesh Awami League, reportedly operating in New Delhi and Kolkata.In a statement, Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said, ""Any form of political activity campaigning against the interests of Bangladesh by Bangladeshi nationals, particularly by the absconding leaders/activists of a banned political party, staying on Indian soil, legally or illegally, including the establishment of offices, is an unambiguous affront against the people and State of Bangladesh.""The reaction came a day after Bangladesh army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman said the military was prepared to assist the interim government in ensuring ""free, fair and neutral"" general elections scheduled for February next year.In Sheikh Hasina's absence, former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has emerged as the single largest party after Yunus’ government disbanded Awami League activities through an executive order.Meanwhile, an offshoot of Students Against Discrimination (SAD) - the group that spearheaded protests against Hasina -- launched the National Citizen Party (NCP) in February, reportedly with Yunus’ support. The NCP is believed to have developed ties with the far-right Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist groups in opposition to the BNP.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said in an official statement: ""the government of india is not aware of any anti-bangladesh activities by purported members of awami league in india"" the reaction came a day after bangladesh army chief general waker-uz-zaman said the military was prepared to assist the interim government in ensuring ""free, fair and neutral"" general elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123412947,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-763761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them: Babushkin

NEW DELHI: As external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited Moscow Wednesday for bilateral talks on trade and economic issues, Russian diplomats here defended energy ties with India and expressed confidence that both countries would handle challenges arising out of the US sanctions against India that they described as unjustified and extremely unfortunate.""It is a challenging situation for India. We enjoy trust in our partnership with India and are committed to addressing challenges in our energy ties,"" said Babushkin, adding Russia has a ""special mechanism"" to deal with any challenge on the sanction issue.Bloomberg quoted the Russian deputy trade representative here as saying that Moscow sells oil to India at about a 5% discount.The Russian embassy later said “regarding oil import prices amid tariffs, a 5% swing is possible subject to negotiation”.The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India to penalise it for oil purchase from Russia. The tariff comes into effect on Aug 27 and despite hopes of a peace agreement emerging from the Putin-Trump Alaska summit, India continues to be targeted by US officials for “profiteering” from Russian oil.“Russia is the biggest supplier to India of crude oil and India’s demands are growing. Certainly, this is a perfect case of mutual accommodation and complementarity of our economies,” said Babushkin.Last week, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned that the Trump administration may increase secondary tariffs on India if it continues to procure Russian crude oil. This week, he accused Indian companies of profiteering from Russian oil trade.“The sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them. We are confident that India-Russia energy cooperation will continue notwithstanding the external pressure,” Babushkin said, accusing the West of behaving like neo-colonial powers.“If hypothetically speaking, India refuses to procure Russian oil, it will not lead to mutually beneficial cooperation with the West,” the Russian diplomat said, adding bilateral trade is likely to reach $100 billion by 2030.Asked about American tariffs on Indian goods, he said the Russian market will welcome Indian exports. He also said the role of Brics as a stabilising force will increase amid the ongoing global turbulence.In terms of GDP, the size of the economy of Brics is about USD 77 trillion while it is USD 57 trillion for Group of Seven (G7) nations, he said, arguing that the Brics is emerging as a major economic power.",India's external affairs minister s jaishankar visited moscow wednesday for bilateral talks on trade and economic issues.

Poll Do you think the UNSC Resolution 2467 is effective in supporting victims of sexual violence? Yes, it is effective No, it is not effective

NEW DELHI: In an address at the UN Security Council Open Debate on 'Conflict-Related Sexual Violence' on Tuesday (local time), India's Charge d'Affaires Eldos Mathew Punnoos brought attention to Pakistan's history of sexual violence since 1971.During his statement, Punnoos acused the neighbouring country of sexual crimes against minority communities' women in Pakistan, describing the situation as concerning. ""The utter impunity with which the Pakistan army perpetrated heinous crimes of gross sexual violence against hundreds of thousands of women in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971 is a matter of shameful record. This deplorable pattern continues unabated and with impunity to this day,"" he said.Given Pakistan's current non-permanent membership in the UNSC, India also raised questions on the Pakistani Army's actions against Bangladeshi women in 1971.""Rampant abduction, trafficking, child early and forced marriages and domestic servitude, sexual violence and forced religious conversions of thousands of vulnerable women and girls as weapons of persecution towards religious and ethnic minority communities are reported and chronicled, including in the recent OHCHR reports,"" further said Punnoos.Punnoos claimed that Pakistan's judicial system validates these offences against women. ""These reports highlight that its judiciary also validates the vile acts by Pakistan. It is ironic that those who perpetrate these crimes are now masquerading as champions of justice. The duplicity and hypocrisy are self-evident.""Further calling for accountability, Punnoos stated that perpetrators of such heinous abuse must be penalised as such crimes leave scars on the entire community of people. ""Sexual violence in conflict zones not only destroys individual lives, but tears apart the very fabric of societies, leaving lasting scars on communities for generations,"" he said.Going on about relief and support, Punnoos said that to tackle the issue, both supporting victims and prosecuting abusers are essential. ""A multifaceted approach is essential to address this crime and offer support to its survivors. This includes prosecuting and deterring such crimes in conflict situations, ensuring no impunity for perpetrators, and adopting a survivor-centric approach in prevention and response mechanisms,"" he said.He highlighted the importance of UNSC Resolution 2467 (2019), which stresses access for victims to relief and reparations, healthcare, psychosocial support, safe shelter, legal aid, and rehabilitation. ""UNSC Resolution 2467 of 2019 has been instrumental in highlighting the need to provide victims access to national relief and reparations programs, health care, psychosocial care, safe shelter, legal aid, and facilitate rehabilitation and reintegration efforts to bring a semblance of normalcy to their lives,"" he added.Punnoos also highlighted that India was among the first nations to contribute to the UN Secretary-General's Trust Fund supporting victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. ""The Secretary General's Trust Fund in support of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse is an important resource which should be further strengthened. India was among the first nations to contribute to this fund and remains committed to supporting such victims,"" he said while recalling India signing a voluntary compact with the UN in November 2017 on eliminating sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping, humanitarian, and development work.""Underlining the seriousness attached to the issue by India, Prime Minister Modi joined the circle of leadership on the prevention of and response to sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations. In our experience, the female engagement teams that India deployed in peacekeeping missions across conflict zones have been tremendously successful in connecting with local communities, addressing gender sensitive issues, engaging with victims and enhancing the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations,"" he further said.India has also pioneered women-led peacekeeping deployments, claimed the UN official representing India. ""In 2007, we were the first country to deploy an all-women-formed police unit to the UN mission in Liberia. Today, we have successfully deployed female contingents in Monosco, UNICEF, and UNMAS with the objective of addressing conflict-related sexual violence. Building on this experience, the Centre for United Nations Peacekeeping in Delhi conducts specialised courses to increase participation of women in peacekeeping operations, including targeted training to prevent and address sexual and gender-based violence in armed conflict,"" he said.India, he said, is ready to share this expertise globally. ""India is ready to share this expertise and experience with interested member states through our comprehensive training programs. These initiatives were further discussed during the Conference of Women Peacekeepers from the Global South, held in New Delhi in February 2025,"" he said.Punnoos also pointed to domestic measures for women’s safety that could guide other nations. ""India has implemented a comprehensive domestic strategy for women's safety. It could offer insights for ensuring access to life-saving services and protection for survivors in conflict situations. First, dedicated resources,"" he added, referring to to the Nirbhaya Fund, with USD 1.2 billion allocated for women’s safety initiatives ""dedicated to ensuring safe environments for women, implementing legislation effectively, and creating a comprehensive infrastructure for swift justice and crisis support"".Punnoos concluded with a strong reaffirmation of India’s stance. ""As I conclude, allow me to once again reaffirm India's unwavering commitment to root out sexual violence in armed conflict and support and assist survivors of such heinous crimes,"" he added.","India's charge d'affaires at the united nations, eldos mathew punnoos brought attention to pakistan's history of sexual violence since 1971.

Here are the key points on ongoing efforts in India-China bilateral relations:



PM Modi reiterated India's commitment to a fair and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue and underlined that stable and constructive relations between the two countries are vital for regional and global peace.

PM welcomed steps such as the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra since his last meeting with Jinping and expressed support for China's presidency of the SCO Summit.

India and China held the 24th round of Special Representatives (SRs) talks on the boundary issue, where Wang Yi said that stable and healthy ties between the two countries are in the fundamental interests of both peoples.

The Chinese foreign ministry said that Doval and Yi held ""comprehensive, in-depth, and productive discussions"" on the India-China border issue and broader bilateral relations.

The NSA recalled his visit to Beijing in December for the previous round of SR talks and mentioned that ties have shown an ""upward trend"" since then. He said the borders have remained quiet, peace and tranquillity have prevailed, and bilateral engagements have become more substantial.

The MEA said that external affairs minister Jaishankar’s meeting with Wang Yi covered bilateral, regional, and international matters of common interest.

India strongly raised its concerns on terrorism in all forms, including cross-border terrorism, during the discussions.

Jaishankar also conveyed India’s concerns regarding the construction of a mega dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo river.

An Expert Group will be set up under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China Border Affairs to explore an early harvest in boundary delimitation along the border areas.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday received an invitation for the upcoming SCO Summit in Tianjin from Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, who conveyed it on behalf of President Xi Jinping during their meeting at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg.While thanking President Xi, PM Modi accepted the invitation and highlighted the importance of the summit.Prime Minister Modi mentioned the steady and positive progress in India-China ties since his meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year.PM Modi wrote on X after meeting Chinese FM Wang Yi: ""Glad to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Since my meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, India-China relations have made steady progress guided by respect for each other's interests and sensitivities. I look forward to our next meeting in Tianjin on the sidelines of the SCO Summit. Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity. ""The meeting came in the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs, including a 50 per cent duty on India.Known for his frequent claims of brokering peace between long-time rivals, Trump may have inadvertently opened space for a thaw in India-China ties.Despite Beijing’s support for Pakistan during Operation Sindoor after the Pahalgam terror attack, the recent easing of tensions between New Delhi and Beijing is being viewed partly as a consequence of Trump’s moves, even though he has not claimed credit.This will be Prime Minister Modi's first visit to China in seven years.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at the sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.The New York Giants made some big moves at the quarterback position this offseason. Brian Dabboll and the front office brought in former Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson to replace Daniel Jones.","Russell wilson's wife and grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.

Why Mark Sanchez believes Justin Fields can turn the Jets’ run-first NFL offense into a 2025 nightmare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-mark-sanchez-believes-justin-fields-can-turn-the-jets-run-first-nfl-offense-into-a-2025-nightmare/articleshow/123410719.cms,"How Justin Fields' rushing power terrifies defenses (Image credits: IG/X)

Justin Fields’ rushing firepower terrifies defenses

Tanner Engstrand unleashes a bruising blueprint of power and patience

Mark Sanchez links Jets’ glory days to Fields’ run-first future

Justin Fields’ shot at redemption: Can New York be his stable home?

The New York Jets’ offense in 2025 is no longer about big-play passing but about bruising runs and relentless ground control. With Breece Hall, Braelon Allen, and Isaiah Davis forming a dangerous trio, and a rebuilt offensive line ready to dominate, new coordinator Tanner Engstrand has installed a run-first philosophy. Yet, for all the talk about the backfield, it’s quarterback Justin Fields’ legs that could transform this attack — a weapon that former Jets QB Mark Sanchez insists cannot be ignored.Fields isn’t just another mobile quarterback — he once posted 1,143 rushing yards and 8 touchdowns with the Chicago Bears in 2022, ranking among the most electric dual-threats in the league. Even in limited action with the Steelers last season, he ran for five touchdowns in six starts, proving that his speed and power still force defenses to adjust.Sanchez sees this as the Jets’ hidden advantage. “They’re going to get a ton of that from Fields,” he said on the Jets’ official site. “Now it’s about picking his spots — when to take the shot, when to check it down. If he can manage that, we all know what a dynamic player he can be.”Engstrand arrives from Detroit carrying a blueprint that values toughness over flash. His scheme leans on heavy rushing volume, designed runs, and deceptive play-action rather than a high-risk passing attack.For Fields, this offers a new lease: he doesn’t need to throw 40 times a game but must punish over-committed defenses with his legs and create openings for receivers downfield.With Hall’s breakaway speed, Allen’s bruising frame, and Davis’ versatility, Engstrand can unleash a three-back rotation that keeps defenses guessing. Add Fields into the mix as a fourth rusher, and the Jets’ ground game suddenly looks unpredictable and punishing.Few voices resonate in New York like Sanchez’s, and his optimism comes from experience. He guided the Jets to back-to-back AFC Championship appearances in 2009 and 2010 under a similar run-heavy identity. He knows how much easier the quarterback’s job becomes when the ground game dictates tempo.For him, Fields’ challenge is not about reinventing himself as a prolific passer but about becoming a smart decision-maker who understands when to take chances and when to let his rushing ability do the damage.The question now is whether Fields can seize this opportunity after an uneven journey through Chicago and Pittsburgh. In New York, he will be surrounded by reliable targets in Garrett Wilson, Josh Reynolds, Allen Lazard, and rookie tight end Mason Taylor, giving him more support than he has ever enjoyed.If Fields blends discipline with dynamism, the Jets could field one of the NFL’s most dangerous rushing attacks. For a franchise long searching for quarterback stability, the irony is clear: their 2025 breakthrough might come not from the air, but from a quarterback running straight through defenses.Also read: Travis Kelce’s locker room stunned and electrified as Taylor Swift turns up for Kansas City Chiefs’ Week 3 clash against Chicago Bears",The new york jets' offense in 2025 is no longer about big-play passing but about bruising runs and relentless ground control.

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report recently said that Elon Musk is quietly “pumping the brakes” on his plans to launch a new political party. The tech billionaire announced ‘ America Party ’ in July after a fallout with President Donald Trump on the spending bill and tax cuts. Elon Musk, as per the report, has stayed in touch with Vice President JD Vance in recent weeks. Quoting people with knowledge of his plans, it adds that the Tesla CEO has “acknowledged to associates that if he goes ahead with forming a political party, he would damage his relationship with the vice president”.Responding to the WSJ report, Elon Musk wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): “Nothing@WSJ says should ever be thought of as true”.In the 2024 presidential election, Elon Musk supported Republican candidate Donald Trump. He spent close to $300 million to support Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 election. Soon after his win, Musk and Trump became strong allies with the tech billionaire leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – task force set up by the Trump administration to cut federal spending.The WSJ report states that the tech CEO hasn’t “formally ruled out creating a new party and could change his mind as the midterm elections near”. It further adds that Elon Musk plans to use “some of his vast financial resources to back Vance if he decides to run for president in 2028”.As per the report, any decision by Elon Musk to abandon plans of launching a third party would work in favor of Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.
