India-Afghanistan Dialogue Highlights Pahalgam Attack, Cross-Border Terror And Pakistan Threats

NEW DELHI: A press conference by Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in New Delhi on Friday drew attention not for what was said, but for who wasn’t in the room. Women journalists were not allowed to attend the event, which was restricted to a handful of male reporters.The interaction, held at the Afghan Embassy just hours after Muttaqi’s talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar , appeared to mirror the gender restrictions long criticised under the Taliban regime.According to people familiar with the matter, the decision on which journalists would be invited was made by Taliban officials accompanying Muttaqi.The Indian side, news agency PTI reported, had suggested that women reporters should also be included among the invitees, a recommendation that was evidently not accepted.Former Union home minister P Chidambaram expressed shock over the incident, saying ""men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded"".""I am shocked that women journalists were excluded from the press conference addressed by Mr Amir Khan Muttaqi of Afghanistan In my personal view, the men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited),"" Chidambaram wrote on X.TMC MP Mahua Moitra said: ""Govt has dishonoured every single Indian woman by allowing Taliban minister to exclude women journalists from presser. Shameful bunch of spineless hypocrites.""The Taliban government in Kabul has faced sustained global condemnation, including from the United Nations , for its curbs on women’s rights, education, and participation in public life.When asked about the condition of women in Afghanistan, Muttaqi sidestepped the question. Instead, he maintained that each country had its own systems and values that should be respected.“Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and there should be respect for them,” he said.Muttaqi claimed that Afghanistan’s situation had improved since the Taliban takeover in August 2021, contrasting current conditions with the years before.“Some 200 to 400 people died in Afghanistan every day before Taliban started ruling the country,” he said.“In these four years, there have been no such losses. Laws are in force and every one has their rights. Those who are engaging in propaganda are making a mistake,” Muttaqi claimed.Defending his government’s record, he added: ""Every country has its own customs, laws and principles, and works according to those. It is not correct that people are not given their rights. If people were not happy with the system and the laws, why has peace returned?""Even as Muttaqi painted a picture of stability, the absence of women journalists at his own press conference put in light the very issue that continues to define Afghanistan’s global image, a peace built without the voices of half its population.","Afghan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi held a press conference in new delhi.

'Let Them Decide': Trump At Oval Office When Asked About NOBEL PRIZE After Gaza Deal

Will Trump get the Peace Prize?

Who are the contenders?







The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The award is considered one of the most anticipated and unpredictable honours.Experts say the committee usually focuses on lasting peace, international cooperation, and the work of institutions that promote these goals.The announcement will be made in Oslo, Norway, where the committee will name the laureate who reflects the values of Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who founded the prize.There has been speculation about the possibility of US President Donald Trump winning the prize, a discussion partly driven by Trump himself. However, experts who follow the Nobel process say his chances are low despite his involvement in several international peace efforts.The announcement comes just hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that could help end the two-year conflict in Gaza.While Trump has claimed credit for pressuring both sides to reach the deal, the timing makes it unlikely that the Nobel Committee considered it.The five-member committee held its final meeting on Monday, when it completed the statement explaining its choice, which is usually decided days in advance.""The Gaza deal has absolutely no significance for the choice of the 2025 laureate because the Nobel Committee has already made its decision,"" historian and Peace Prize expert Asle Sveen told news agency AFP.""Trump will not win the prize this year. I’m 100 percent certain,"" he said.A total of 338 individuals and organisations have been nominated for the 2025 Peace Prize, but the list remains secret for 50 years. With no clear favourite, several possible names are being discussed in Oslo.Among them are Sudan’s Emergency Response Rooms, a network of volunteers helping civilians during war and famine; Yulia Navalnaya, widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which monitors elections.The committee could also choose a laureate that signals its position on global issues, even if it invites criticism from the United States.Possible choices include UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres , the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), or international courts such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).Organisations defending press freedom, such as the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) or Reporters Without Borders (RSF), are also being discussed as potential winners.Last year’s prize went to Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that campaigns against nuclear weapons.The Nobel Peace Prize includes a diploma, a gold medal, and a $1.2 million cash award.The economics prize, to be announced on Monday, will conclude the 2025 Nobel season, which has already seen awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, and peace.","The norwegian nobel committee will announce the winner of the nobel peace prize on friday.

The group stated that the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners would begin within 72 hours of the deal’s implementation.Under the first phase of the agreement to end the war in Gaza, Hamas said it would release 20 surviving hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

NEW DELHI: The landmark visit by Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India Friday saw India declaring it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to the level of embassy, while announcing a slew of projects and humanitarian gestures to advance ties with Afghanistan. External affairs minister S Jaishankar said cooperation between the 2 sides contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience, as he announced a formal reopening of the embassy.Muttaqi said after the meeting that India too had agreed to receive Afghan diplomats here, although not at the ambassador level. While not a formal recognition of the regime in Kabul, the upgrade still marks a significant boost for diplomatic ties and ongoing efforts to remove hurdles in further deepening economic cooperation. India shut its embassy in Kabul after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in 2021 but, in June 2022, the government positioned a technical team in the embassy mainly to supervise distribution of humanitarian aid.In the meeting, Jaishankar underlined India’s concerns about cross-border border terrorism, including the activities of Pakistan based terror groups with possible links in Afghanistan, and Muttaqi assured him Taliban won’t allow any group to use the country against others.Without naming Pakistan, both sides unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries in a joint statement, while underscoring the importance of promoting peace, stability, and mutual trust in the region.With the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan going into a tailspin over the activities of Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), Jaishankar also stressed India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan and got the same assurance from Muttaqi.“We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said Jaishankar in his opening remarks, as he appreciated Taliban’s sensitivity towards India’s security concerns and the solidarity in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.Muttaqi also invited Indian companies to invest in the mining sector, saying this would help strengthen the bilateral trade and commercial relations. According to a joint statement, India expressed its willingness to assist the Afghan government in reconstructing residential buildings in the earthquake affected areas.The Indian side expressed concern about the plight of forcibly repatriated Afghan refugees, saying their dignity and livelihood is important and agreeing to help construct residences for them and continue providing material aid to rebuild their lives.Jaishankar said India’s longstanding development partnership with Afghanistan, which has seen more than 500 Indian projects spread across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, stood renewed and announced the launch of 6 new projects. “As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” said Jaishankar.There was also focus on sports, especially cricket, to advance cultural interactions with Jaishankar saying the emergence of Afghan cricketing talent had been truly impressive. He also committed to expanding avenues for Afghan students to pursue studies at Indian universities, citing more Indian visas for Afghan nationals in medical, business and student categories.The minister also announced a gift of 20 ambulances in a goodwill gesture of good, in addition to MRI and CT scan machines to Afghan hospitals and vaccines for immunization and cancer medicines.","India declares it will upgrade its technical mission in kabul to the level of embassy.

US agencies have imposed sanctions against eight Indian nationals and 10 companies for links with Iranian oil trade. As part of the latest round of global sanctions, the US state department's actions were against 40 individuals, entities and vessels, while the US treasury acted against 60 entities.On the US treasury's office of foreign assets control list are Niti Unmesh Bhat, Kamala K Kasat, Kunal Kasat and Poonam Kasat (all based in Mumbai), Tamil Nadu-born Iyappan Raja, Varun Pula from Tirupati apart from Piyush Maganlal Jiviya and Soniya Shrestha.Among the 10 entities named were Pula's Bertha Shipping, which is accused of using its Comoros-owned vessel to transport nearly four million barrels of Iranian LPG to China.Similarly, Raja’s Marshall Islands-based Evie Lines, which owns a Panama-flagged vessel, shipped one million barrels of LPG to China. Shrestha, who owns India-based Vega Star Ship, used Comoros-flagged NEPTA to move Iranian origin LPG to Pakistan.In a statement, the US state department said between Jan 2024 and Jan 2025, India-based petrochemicals company CJ Shah & Co imported Iranian-origin petrochemical products worth $44 million from multiple companies.Javiya-owned Chemovick is also accused of importing Iranian-origin petrochem of $7 million.BK Sales Corp allegedly imported petrochemical products worth $235 million, while Mody Chem is said to have imported $49 worth of Iranian Petrochem between Jan 2024 and Feb 2025.Similarly, Paarichem Resources imported $2 million worth of Iranian-origin petrochemical products from multiple companies, including US-designated Shivnani Organics FZE, between May and Nov 2024, which included products such as toluene, US state department said.Niti Bhatt-owned Indisol dealt in shipments of $74 million between Jan-Dec 2024, while Haresh Petrochem, owned by Kasats, was found to have imported Iranian-origin goods of $10 million over 13 months, starting Jan ’24.","India-based firm shipped iranian-origin lpg to pak: us.

In 1971, Hindus constituted 82% and the Muslim population was 11%, while in 1991, Hindus constituted 81% and the Muslim community accounted for 12.12%, while in 1991, we accounted for 89%, and Muslims accounted for 14.2%. I'm talking about the populations of only two religions because I want to talk about infiltration,"" Shah saidDelivering the Narendra Mohan Smriti Lecture at Sahitya Shrishti Samman ceremony, the home minister said, ""The Muslim population has increased by 24.6 per cent, whereas the Hindu population has decreased by 4.5 per cent. I am telling you this because it hasn't happened because of the fertility rate. It has happened because of infiltration.""""Hindu population decreased in Pakistan and Bangladesh as many of them fled and took refuge in India. And the Muslim population that increased in India wasn't due to fertility, it was because many from the community infiltrated into the country,"" the home minister said.He asked people to recognise the consequences of infiltration to effect demographic shifts for democracy.""I want to say without hesitation that until every Indian understands these three issues, we cannot ensure safety for our country, it's culture, languages, and our independence. These three topics are interconnected,"" he stated and cited censuses from 1951, 1971, 1991, and 2011 to highlight the changing demography.Shah linked the sharp drop in Jharkhand's tribal population to similar incursions, announcing that the Modi govt's high-powered Demographic Mission would examine illegal migration's effects on religious and social fabric, population trends, and border security. He blamed ""vote-bank"" politics for infiltration, and said that it was ironic while Gujarat and Rajasthan have remained secure despite being border states, West Bengal has emerged as an epicentre of the serious threat. ""Some political parties do not see a threat to the nation in infiltrators; they only see a vote bank,"" he remarked, decrying Congress 's role in the religious partition of India as a profound error.Shah defended the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which grants citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, and Buddhist refugees, as fulfilling a national pledge redeemed by Prime Minister Modi. ""Opposition parties spread lies about the CAA; by bringing it, Modi Ji performed atonement for decades of governance errors,"" he asserted. He emphasised that minorities persecuted on religious grounds in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh since independence deserve sanctuary in India. Endorsing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, Shah argued that embedding infiltrators into voters' lists corrupts constitutional integrity. He reiterated that Muslim population growth stems from ""infiltration from Pakistan and Bangladesh and not because of fertility.""Infiltrators' inclusion in voter lists, he warned, taints the political process. ""When you are protecting infiltrators, you are polluting the spirit of the Constitution,"" Shah said, adding, ""We will follow the detect, delete and deport process for infiltrators."" He lambasted Congress: ""Outsiders will not decide who gets to vote whom in India. India's democracy will be run by Indians-not dictated by outsiders or Congress-backed lobbies.

Taliban seek opening of India-Pak border for trade with India; government to accept Taliban diplomats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-stand-on-recognising-kabul-regime-will-be-aligned-with-international-communitys/articleshow/124465388.cms,"Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi

Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi backed trade through the Chabahar port route and called for opening the India-Pakistan Attari-Wagah border for trade with India. At a press conference in the Afghanistan embassy, following his meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Muttaqi also announced that the Taliban will appoint diplomats in India.Pakistan does not allow India to export to Afghanistan via the land route, and the Indian government has used the Chabahar port in Iran for trade and commerce with Afghanistan. The US, however, last month revoked the 2018 sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop the port and access Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.Muttaqi said trade is meant to benefit people and should not be mixed with politics. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all 3 countries,’’ said Muttaqi, addressing a press conference at the Afghanistan embassy for which no woman journalist was invited. He also announced the formation of a trade committee to remove obstacles in commercial ties with India.Muttaqi also reiterated Afghanistan’s position that it won’t allow the US to take control of the Bagram airbase, even as it remains open to diplomatic ties with Washington. Indian government sources later confirmed India had agreed to work with the Taliban to have their diplomats stationed here but added India’s position on formal recognition will remain broadly aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi addressed the media with a small flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), Taliban’s name for the country, placed on the table. He told reporters the embassy building, which still flies the flag of the erstwhile Islamic Republic, belonged to the IEA. “The appointment of diplomats will be a step towards normalisation and further improvement of ties,” said Muttaqi. The appointment will not be at the ambassador level, in the absence of formal recognition by India. The diplomats appointed by the Taliban will be allowed to work from the embassy.Asked about women’s rights, a sticking point in the Taliban’s ties with the international community, Muttaqi said all countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected. He was also non-committal on whether girls or women would be allowed to travel to India for studies.""In the recent earthquake in Afghanistan, India was the first responder. Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations. We are ready to create a consultative mechanism of understanding, which helps towards strengthening our relations,” said Muttaqi.The issue of women rights has been flagged by Indian authorities from several multilateral forums. India believes Taliban must work towards the formation of a truly inclusive government and preservation of women, children and minorities.Muttaqi also said he and Jaishankar discussed security concerns in detail. “The IEA has proven in the last four years that the territory of Afghanistan will not be used against others. And it remains committed to that policy that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to threaten others,” said Muttaqi.","Afghanistan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi called for opening the india-pakistan attari-wagah border for trade with india.

He also called Afghanistan as a ""contiguous"" neighbour to send a strong message to Pakistan over its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir.""As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,"" Jaishankar said.""However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face.

Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy,"" he added.India and Afghanistan share a narrow 106-km land border through the Wakhan Corridor — a strategically vital strip now drawing Chinese interest.In the context of Jaishankar’s statement, the corridor links Afghanistan to the part of Kashmir illegally occupied by Pakistan.Meanwhile, Muttaqi described India as an important country of the region and one that has always stood by Afghan people and assisted them in many areas.""We will not allow any (element) to threaten anyone else or use the territory of Afghanistan against others. Daesh is a challenge for the region and Afghanistan is at the frontlines of this struggle,"" he said.""Luckily, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, its forces and its strong struggle against it has eradicated it from Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: In another technical issue with one of its Dreamliners, an Air India Boeing 787 (VT-ANC) operating from Vienna to Delhi on Thursday night diverted to Dubai following a technical snag. The same aircraft subsequently took off for Delhi after its auto pilot as reset and landed at IGI Airport around noon on Friday.While AI maintains there was no safety issue with the aircraft, this is was the second instance within a week with its Dreamliners. Last Saturday (Oct 4) the ram air turbine (RAT) of an AI Dreamliner had deployed on its final approach to Birmingham. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Friday asked the aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to “ground all B787s in light of continuous electrical problems” and also order a “special audit of AI aircraft maintenance. ” AI maintains its Boeing 787s were found to be perfectly safe to fly after each one of them was checked extensively after AI 171 crash.An AI spokesperson said the Vienna-Delhi flight was diverted due to a technical issue. “The aircraft landed safely at Dubai and underwent necessary checks. All passengers were kept informed of the delay, provided refreshments and the flight, operated by the same aircraft, departed Dubai at 8.45 am (IST) and landed in Delhi at 12.19 pm (IST).At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remain top priority…. there was (no) electrical failure in the said aircraft. ”The DGCA is probing last Saturday’s RAT deployment. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is probing the June 12 AI 171 crash of an AI Dreamliner.The FIP said in its Friday mail to govt: “Since June 16, we have reiterated that all B-787s in the country must be checked thoroughly for electrical systems. On Oct 4, RAT deployed on AI-117 while on approach to Birmingham. On October 9, AI 154 Vienna to Delhi diverted to Dubai which had major technical issues where the autopilot system suddenly failed triggering a series of technical malfunctions. The aircraft experienced failures across critical systems which included Autopilots, instrument landing system and flight control system degradation with no autoland capability. ”“The pilots could not engage the autopilots due electrical malfunctions; thus, pilots were constrained to fly manually at night and divert to Dubai. Moreover, the FD's were not available with degraded flight control systems. The aircraft landed safely at Dubai. We compliment the skill of the pilots to fly the aircraft at night safely to Dubai with limited automation/systems Two incidents of electrical malfunctions in a short span of time are indicators of poor serviceability by AI,” FIP added.Regarding last Saturday’s RAT deployment, Air India said in: “On Oct 4, 2025, the operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham, detected the deployment of RAT of the aircraft during its final approach. The crew had found all electrical and hydraulic parameters to be normal, and the aircraft landed safely at Birmingham Airport. At no point during the flight was there any loss of power or control systems. The aircraft was subsequently grounded for further inspections. Based on the conclusions from our preliminary investigations, the deployment of the RAT was neither due to a system fault nor pilot action.”“The deployment of the RAT was ‘uncommanded’, consistent with similar occurrences with other airlines in the past, as reported by Boeing. Air India had notified the Indian aviation regulator, DGCA, about the occurrence and has submitted the preliminary report to the regulator in accordance with the prescribed guidelines. The aircraft was subsequently cleared for service, and it operated from Birmingham to Delhi on 5 October. At Air India, the safety of all passengers and crew remains our foremost priority,” AI statement added.",The same aircraft subsequently took off for delhi after its auto pilot as reset and landed at igi airport around noon on friday. This is was the second instance within a week with its dreamliners.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday backed the Election Commission’s SIR, and said Hindus from Pakistan and Bangladesh have rights on Indian soil while distinguishing refugees from infiltrators.“I want to ask all citizens, who should decide who becomes the prime minister or chief minister? Should anyone other than the citizens of the country have the right to decide this?” Shah asked at an event in New Delhi, reported news agency PTI.Shah said that Hindus in Pakistan were promised refuge in India under the Nehru-Liaquat Pact after partition, but the successive governments failed to honour that promise, which was finally fulfilled by the Modi government through the Citizenship Amendment Act.“Just as much right I have on the soil of this country, that much right the Hindus of Pakistan-Bangladesh have on this soil. I say this as the home minister of the country,” he said.Shah further explained that refugees come to India to save their religion, while infiltrators cross over illegally for economic reasons.“Those who have not faced religious persecution and want to come illegally for economic or other reasons are infiltrators.If anyone in the world who wants to come here is allowed, our country will become a dharamshala,” he said.The home minister also said no one should interfere with the SIR process, adding that such exercises were also held when the Congress was in power.“The opposition is opposing it because their vote banks are getting cut. It is the Election Commission’s Constitutional responsibility to clean the voters’ list. If you have any issues, you can go to court,” he said.Citing Census data, Shah said the Hindu population fell from 84% in 1951 to 79% in 2011, while the Muslim population rose from 9.8% to 14.2%.“According to the 2011 Census, the growth rate of Muslims was 24.6% and that of Hindus 16.8%. This is not because of fertility but due to infiltration,” he remarked.","Union home minister amit shah says hindus from pakistan and bangladesh have rights on indian soil.

On the eve of World Palliative Day, palliative care experts have drawn attention to ""passive violence"" implicit in the dismal access that Indians have to basic pain relief. Forty years after palliative care came to India, it is estimated that barely 4% of citizens have access, reports Rema Nagarajan.Dr MR Rajagopal, founder chairman of Pallium India, a non-governmental organisation working on improving access to palliative care in India, told TOI, ""84% of the world has negligible access to palliative care. Low- and middle-income countries use only 6% of global opioids for pain relief. Guidelines designed for the Global North have failed 84% of the world's population. We need a palliative care strategy specifically for the Global South. ""The theme of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, observed on October 11, is ""Achieving the Promise - Universal Access to Palliative Care"". By 2030, the world envisioned universal health coverage - including palliative care -for all.""It's rather obvious we're nowhere near that promise. But if we're to achieve it at any point in the visible future, we need realistic plans. Low- and middle-income countries use only 6% of global opioids for pain relief. Is this not passive violence by our healthcare systems? Add the active violence of catastrophic health expenditure and the menace of inappropriate end-of-life care that inflicts suffering,"" said Rajagopal, hailed as the father of palliative care in India.","Barely 4% of indians have access to palliative care.

However, according to 'Prison Statistics India 2023' - published by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 73.5% of all prisoners are undertrials, 3.9 lakh out of 5.3 lakh prisoners.Section 62(5) of RP Act provides that ""No person shall vote at any election if he is confined in a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or otherwise, or is in the lawful custody of police"". However, it did not bar a person under preventive detention to vote.The petitioner has sought a direction to the Election Commission to frame guidelines for preserving the voting rights of persons lodged in prison during the pendency of trial and set up polling booths inside prisons to enable them to cast their votes, or facilitate them to use postal ballots, if they are lodged in a prison which is outside their constituencies or state.The petitioner said convicted prisoners or those arrested for charges of corruption may not be given voting rights. It said undertrials have voting rights in most countries, including Pakistan.""A blanket ban violates the universally-recognised principle of presumption of innocence. In India, over 75% prisoners are pre-trial or undertrial detainees, many of whom remain incarcerated for decades.

Taliban Seeks India’s Recognition For Islamic Emirate Ahead Of Muttaqi-Jaishankar Talks in Delhi

Poll Should India consider granting formal recognition to the Taliban government? Yes, it can boost bilateral ties No, caution is necessary

The Taliban are seeking an upgrade of their relationship with India in the form of diplomatic recognition, as the Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi meets external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday. Muttaqi arrived in Delhi Thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost India’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with Kabul, even without a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul.On the eve of Muttaqi’s meeting with Jaishankar here, a top Taliban leader told TOI it’s time for both governments to elevate the relationship by granting recognition to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by the Taliban for the country.“It is the first high level visit by our foreign minister to India and is very significant. We expect it will initiate a new phase of relations between the two countries. There are a lot of areas which can be explored for mutual cooperation during this visit,” said the head of Taliban’s political office and Afghanistan’s ambassador to Qatar Suhail Shaheen.“I think it is time for leadership of both countries to raise the diplomatic level by granting recognition to IEA government and thus paving the way for bilateral cooperation and expansion of relations in various fields,” added Shaheen.The UN Security Council earlier waived a travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to travel to India. That India was keen to host Muttaqi is a sign of growing trust in the relationship as the Taliban urge India to expand its economic footprint in the country. The visit also helps India further capitalise on the dramatic deterioration in the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan, which accuses Kabul of funding and arming the Pakistan Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Recognition for the Taliban, however, remains a tricky issue for India as the Indian government wants its position to be in consonance with that of the international community. That position is unlikely to change with Muttaqi’s visit. As multiple sources here told TOI, the visit is only indicative of an enhancement in bilateral relations and diplomatic engagements.As the government has said in the past, India seeks a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan, where the interests of all sections of Afghan society including women, children and minorities are protected. Additionally, despite credible assurances by Kabul that it won’t allow Afghanistan to be used against India, the Indian government still has concerns about links between Pakistan-based terror groups and forces in Afghanistan. While several countries have accepted Taliban-appointed officials as diplomats, Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul.This lack of recognition is unlikely to come in the way of India’s efforts to ramp up its ties with the Taliban as it maintains its ties are guided by historical relations and friendship with the people of Afghanistan. While India already has projects across the 34 provinces of the country, it has also committed to engaging in more development projects soon, while continuing with its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme, buoyed by the support it has received from the Taliban.Apart from Delhi, Muttaqi is also likely to travel to Agra and Deoband. He was earlier also planning to travel to Mumbai and Hyderabad but that has now been cancelled.",Amir khan muttaqi arrived in delhi thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost india’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with kabul.

The Nobel Committee cited her “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”Trump had actively campaigned for the prize over the past year, calling himself the “president of peace” and repeatedly claiming to have “ended six or seven wars.” In September, he told UN delegates that his “peace record” was unmatched, citing conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and “even Thailand and Cambodia.”The award represents a personal blow to Trump, who has said he “should have gotten [the prize] four or five times” and that “everyone says” he deserves it.

The Man Who took the life of TikToker Yoon Ji-ah — The Dark Truth Behind “Black Cat”

The digital world in South Korea is mourning after losing Yoon Ji-ah who was known for being a TikToker and live streamer with more than 300,000 fans. On September 11, she was found dead on a secluded mountain in Muju County, North Jeolla Province, only a few hours after her last live stream. The terrifying circumstances of her passing have once again raised the issues of the dark side of fan communities and influencer security in the era of the internet.Police have indicated that Yoon Ji-ah met with her death about 30 minutes after cutting off her last stream. The 30-year-old digital star was pronounced dead with serious physical injuries inflicted on her body through beating, strangling, and asphyxias. Later, the medical examiner declared the cause of death to be suffocation from neck compression.Initially, the fan's affection reportedly transformed into obsession. Choi, who presented himself as a CEO enjoying success, was actually an individual who had gotten into deep financial trouble and lost his home through auction. He had created a fake persona and was financially supported which led him to create a close bond with Yoon and even convince her to go into business together.But there were reports about Yoon having recently sought to break the ties claiming controlling behavior and demanding schedule as reasons. The CCTV clips released by the detectives showed Choi kneeling and asking for forgiveness just before the tragic event. As per his later confession, he dragged her into her car before killing.After the murder, Choi made an effort to hide his actions, dressing up with a suitcase, and taking several stops to misdirect the police before he left Yoon's body on the mountainside. He was captured 12 hours after the incident. He first proclaimed his innocence but later admitted it when the police found the corpse.The death of Yoon Ji-ah has created a wave of nationwide protests and mourning compared to which the calls for more effective safety measures for content creators against the obsessive online behavior are stronger than ever. Her death serves as a grim reminder of the dangers influencers face, prompting urgent calls for stronger digital safety laws, mental health awareness, and accountability within online communities to prevent similar tragedies. Yoon Ji-ah’s story stands as a haunting reminder of love turned obsession, fame turned fear, and the urgent need to protect those who bring light to the digital world.","Yoon ji-ah, 30, was found dead on a secluded mountain in muju county, north jeolla province, only a few hours after her last live stream.
