Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar , one of India's greatest visionaries. There have been deliberate and unjust attempts to downplay the legacy of Dr Ambedkar . After more than a century, the greatest injustice to his legacy is to reduce him to a Dalit leader. Today, he should be seen not merely as a symbol of resistance for Dalits and marginalised, which he undoubtedly is and always will be, but also as one of the foremost thinkers of modern India.It is recorded that when he was at school, he was not even permitted to drink water from the common tap that other children drank from. One day, in the scorching heat, when he decided to drink from the source closest to him, he was assaulted for daring to violate this oppressive taboo. After such an incident, many young boys would have been resigned to their fate. Others may have become reactionary, rebelling against an unjust system through violent action. But Ambedkar channelised his inner angst into a zeal for learning. He went on to get an MA, MSc, PhD, DSc, DLitt and Bar-at-Law, including degrees at Columbia and London School of Economics.Providence granted Dr Ambedkar unparalleled grit, intellect and integrity, which he put to use as a social reformer , jurist, economist, philosopher, human rights champion and nation-builder. His role as an institution builder also needs to be highlighted. Several institutions in modern India, such as RBI and Central Water Commission, find their genesis in Babasaheb's farsightedness.Being a staunch democrat, Dr Ambedkar also believed that a democratic form of govt presupposes a democratic form of society. He believed that without moral order in society, there cannot be democracy and rule of law. It can also be said that for him, democracy, politics and ethics formed a trinity just like liberty, equality and fraternity. Like his greatest interlocutor, Gandhiji, Dr Ambedkar was committed to fundamental social reform.This is because he was deeply worried about the future of India, its democracy, and hard-earned independence. His trepidations found expression in his last speech in the Constituent Assembly. Amid loud cheers, Dr Ambedkar held that we must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood. He forewarned that India would lose its democracy and independence a second time if Indians become complacent.It is his words of caution that set India on the path of a vibrant democracy for almost eight decades. However, today, we see attempts by some people to reduce the fraternity between Indians based on social cleavages such as caste, religion, ethnicity, language etc. We should be on guard to ensure that these divisive tendencies remain nothing but failed attempts. For instance, Ambedkar mocked the Aryan invasion theory at a time when he could have gained most from the Aryan-Dravidian divide. ""Whether a tribe or family was racially Aryan or Dravidian was a question which never troubled the people of India until foreign scholars came in and began to draw the line,"" Babasaheb wrote in a paper published in 1918.Furthermore, those who are attempting to use linguistic issues to further their narrow and sectarian interests would greatly benefit by reading Dr Ambedkar's views on the unity of the nation and the role of a language in this. On Sept 10, 1949, he moved an amendment in the Constituent Assembly supporting Sanskrit - one of the nine languages he had mastered - as the official language of the Union. In his 'Thoughts on Linguistic States', he also declared it the ""bounden duty of all Indians to own up Hindi as their language"". Dr Ambedkar believed that social and economic democracy goes hand in hand with political democracy. PM Narendra Modi ji has set a target of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, which conforms to the vision of Babasaheb.Last month, when PM Modi visited Deekshabhoomi, he reaffirmed govt's commitment to work even harder to realise the India which Babasaheb envisioned. Babasaheb's birth anniversary presents all Indians with an opportunity to renew our pledge to the values and ideals given by him. Let us rise above our race, religion, region, caste and creed, and be 'Indian'.The writer is India's Raksha Mantri",Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of dr b r ambedkar.

"India First Laser Weapon: Watch: In a first, India uses laser-based weapon to shoot down aircraft, missiles and drones; joins select list of countries that have capability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-in-a-first-india-uses-laser-based-weapon-to-shoot-down-aircraft-missiles-and-drones-joins-select-list-of-countries-that-have-capability/articleshow/120253421.cms,"Poll Should the focus shift towards high-energy microwave systems as well? No, stick with lasers for now Yes, diversify technologies

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies.""""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare. These advancements align with global trends emphasizing high-power lasers for missile defense and counter-drone operations.","The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.

Poll Should the Indian government pursue stricter laws against individuals involved in terror activities? No, current laws are sufficient Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in its ongoing probe into Tahawwur Rana's involvement in the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, is focusing on the network of people who helped plan the conspiracy.Rana was questioned for the second day in a row as investigators try to understand how the large-scale attack was planned and who all were involved. NIA is also directing its effort to examine the possible links of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.As sources informed PTI news agency, the NIA is dissecting dozens of phone calls between Rana and Headley, using them to piece together the larger conspiracy that spanned continents. Investigators believe these conversations hold vital clues to the operational details of the attacks, and to those who worked behind the scenes.One of the leads includes a person based in Dubai, believed to have met Rana on Headley’s request. Investigators think this man knew about the attack plans. They are also checking if this ""mystery man"" was connected to Dawood Ibrahim or his criminal network known as D-Company, which is based in Dubai, as sources told IANS news agency.The agency is also looking into Rana’s possible ties with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which carried out the attacks. NIA officials believe the planning for the 26/11 attacks may have started as early as 2005.To support their investigation, Rana’s fresh voice samples have been sent for testing to match with calls made right after the attack. Investigators also suspect that Rana may have visited several parts of India before the attack, possibly to assist in planning.Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening. A Delhi court gave the NIA 18 days of custody to question him. He is currently being held at the NIA headquarters in Delhi in a high-security cell.According to the NIA, Rana is being questioned not just for his role in the Mumbai attacks, but also to see if he was involved in planning similar terror attacks in other Indian cities. He faces several serious charges, including conspiracy, murder, and helping terrorists.The 2008 Mumbai attacks were among the deadliest in India’s history. Ten terrorists came to Mumbai by boat and attacked several places including the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, CST railway station, and Nariman House. The attacks lasted three days, killing 166 people and injuring over 230.With Rana now in India, the NIA is hoping to get a clearer picture of how the entire plot was put together and who all were involved behind the scenes.","Tahawwur rana was extradited from the us and brought to india on thursday evening.

Kernel of calm for Goa's cashew business as Trump hits 90-day pause on higher tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kernel-of-calm-for-goas-cashew-business-as-trump-hits-90-day-pause-on-higher-tariffs/articleshow/120266725.cms,"PANAJI: US President Donald Trump's decision to hit pause on his trade war - except with China - has alleviated anxieties in the far corners of North Goa. While Trump's tariff tantrums did not result in any additional duties on Indian cashew nuts, his move to impose higher tariffs on Vietnam, which holds more than 80% market share of cashews in the US, would have seen nuts from Vietnam and African nations flooding India.Owners of cashew nut processing plants said that such an eventuality would have sent prices tumbling in Goa. Vietnam, which has the lion's share as a supplier of cashews - raw and processed - in the US market, was hit with a steep 46% tariff by Trump before the 90-day pause was announced.Vietnam imports raw cashews from West African nations and then exports them to the US. If the demand from the US and Vietnam had dropped, cashew nuts from West Africa would have swamped India, crashing cashew prices. ""If Vietnam is affected, it will default on the African crop and the price will drop. This is our worry,"" Goa Cashew Manufacturers Association president Rohit Zantye said. Vietnam imports raw cashew nuts from Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Benin, Tonga, and Ghana. Goan companies also tap those markets. Many Goan cashew nut processing factories and packers have already placed import orders for the current year.As of now, the landed cost for African cashew nuts is Rs 155 per kg while for Goa cashew nuts, which are of a higher quality, it is Rs 175 per kg. ""We have already purchased 40% of our raw material. If the raw cashew prices collapse after we have purchased at a higher price, it would have been a challenge,"" Zantye said. ""Those who have bought local produce will be in the soup since the African cashew nuts will flood the Indian market,"" he added.The reciprocal tariffs imposed by Trump roiled the international markets last week and an impact analysis by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) had said tariffs could be an opportunity for the cashew nut processing units. ""Vietnam is the dominant supplier of cashews (raw as well as processed) in the US market with more than 80% share,"" the Ficci report said. ""Since the reciprocal tariff imposed on Vietnam is considerably high at 46%, this gives an opportunity to other exporting countries like India to expand their market share in the US.""India currently has a 0.9% share in the export of fresh or dried cashew nuts to the US, the same as Nigeria, while Vietnam has an 88% share. Trump's reciprocal tariff on India is just 26%. In terms of preserved cashew nuts, India has a 6% share in exports to the US. However, the 15-odd cashew nut processing units in North Goa were worried last week. The state's cashew crop spanning 55,302 hectares yields estimated 27,070 tonnes annually.","Us president donald trump's decision to hit pause on his trade war - except with china - has alleviated anxieties in the far corners of north goa.

30kW DEW Targets Drones & Missiles at 3.5 km,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-laser-system-to-destroy-aerial-targets/articleshow/120266057.cms,"NEW Delhi: India for the first time on Sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors, joining a select group of countries like the US, Russia, China, UK and Israel in the quest for effective Star Wars-like directed energy weapons (DEWs).The multiple tests of the Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) to destroy a small fixed-wing aircraft and a swarm of seven drones as well as “blind” surveillance cameras and sensors mounted on drones and deployed on the ground, at ranges up to 3.5-km, were conducted at the national open air range at Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh.“It is a very powerful and reusable weapon for 'beam kills’, instead of ‘kinetic kills’ with expensive missiles and ammunition. With low cost per kill, it’s much more economical, especially for extended wars like we are now seeing. This is the technology of the future,” DRDO director-general (electronics and communication systems) Dr B K Das told TOI.The 30-kilowatt vehicle-based integrated drone detection and interdiction system (IDD&IS) marks a significant breakthrough for India, which has lagged far behind other countries in developing such cost-effective counter-drone systems.The challenge will be to miniaturise the system for deployment on airborne platforms and warships as well. The armed forces have so far inducted 23 IDD&IS systems, with 2-kilowatt lasers, for around Rs 400 crore, with DRDO also completing the development of 10-kilowatt lasers. But their kill ranges are just about 1 to 2-km, as reported by TOI earlier.“The Laser-DEW Mark-II(A) was tested for a 3.5-km range in hot weather or extreme conditions on Sunday. User trials can take place in 1-1.5 years, with technology being transferred by DRDO to companies for production,” Dr Das said.With the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems and the fast emergence of deadly drone swarms as asymmetric threats, DRDO is now also working on DEWs with power levels of 50 to 100-kilowatt as well as high-energy microwaves, as per a roadmap laid down with short, medium and long-term goals.“Cost-effective defence solutions to tackle low-cost drone attacks is driving the adoption of DEWs by militaries worldwide. The cost of firing a DEW for a few seconds is equivalent to the cost of a couple of litres of petrol. Therefore, it has the potential to be a long-term and low-cost alternative to defeat a variety of targets,” another DRDO official said.Some countries are far ahead in this arena. The US, for instance, has already deployed Helios’ (high energy laser with integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance), with a 60-kilowatt laser that can be scaled up to 120-kilowatt, on some of its frontline warships to intercept armed drones, missiles and fast-attack craft.Israel, in turn, is getting set to deploy a 100-kilowatt Iron Beam’ laser weapon system with a 10-km range, while the UK is developing Dragon Fire’ for its warships.While firing focussed beams of concentrated electromagnetic energy at the speed of light at targets may be much cheaper than conventional kinetic weapons, DEWs are still to enter large-scale operational use.The kill ranges of DEWs are still far less than conventional weapons, and bad weather can adversely impact their performance. “Advancements in technology will lead to more powerful and versatile weapons. One such advancement is the development of more powerful and efficient lasers, allowing for greater range and precision. Additionally, advancements in beam-steering technology and adaptive optics may enhance the DEW’s ability to maintain focus and accuracy at longer ranges,” a DRDO scientist said.","India for the first time on sunday demonstrated the capability to use a potent 30-kilowatt laser-based system to disable, degrade or destroy small remotely-piloted aircraft, swarm drones, missiles and sensors.

Ukraine says Russian strike hit Indian pharma firm Kusum healthcare's warehouse: What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ukraine-says-russian-strike-hit-indian-pharma-firm-kusum-healthcares-warehouse-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/120245952.cms,"Photo credit: X/@MartinHarrisOBE

Here's what we know so far about the incident:

What happened?

Poll Do you believe the missile strike on Kusum Healthcare's warehouse was a deliberate attack? No, it was accidental Yes, it was deliberate

What's the response of Indian and Russian government?



Kusum Healthcare’s presence in Ukraine



Conflict continues despite ceasefire talks

Amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, a warehouse belonging to an Indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a Russian missile in Ukraine on Saturday in what the Ukrainian embassy in India described as a ""deliberate attack.""The Ukrainian embassy in India said on Saturday that a Russian missile had hit the warehouse of Kusum Healthcare , an Indian pharmaceutical company operating in Ukraine.""Today, a Russian missile struck the warehouse of Indian pharmaceutical company Kusum in Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian embassy said in a post on X.In the same post, the embassy added: ""While claiming 'special friendship' with India, Moscow deliberately targets Indian businesses -- destroying medicines meant for children and the elderly.""So far, no additional details have been shared about the damage or casualties from the strike.The Indian and Russian governments are yet to comment on the matter.Martin Harris, the UK's ambassador to Ukraine, also claimed that Russian strikes destroyed a ""major pharma's warehouse in Kyiv"". However, his post did not mention whether the warehouse belongs to Kusum and also said the attack was carried out by Russian drones and not a missile.The governments of India and Russia have not yet issued any statements regarding the incident.Meanwhile, Martin Harris, the British ambassador to Ukraine, also said that Russian strikes had destroyed a ""major pharma’s warehouse in Kyiv."" However, he did not specify whether the warehouse belonged to Kusum Healthcare. He also mentioned that the attack was carried out using Russian drones, not a missile.""This morning Russian drones completely destroyed a major pharmaceuticals warehouse in Kyiv, incinerating stocks of medicines needed by the elderly and children. Russia's campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians continues,"" Mr Martin said in a post on X.According to its official website, headquartered in Delhi, Kusum Healthcare operates in 29 countries, including Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, Mali, and Tanzania.The company is among several Indian firms with a business presence in Ukraine, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both countries have continued to exchange strikes. Although they agreed last month to stop targeting each other’s energy facilities, each side has accused the other of violating the agreement.India has maintained that dialogue is the only path to peace and has not taken sides in the conflict, even while keeping good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow.In a podcast interview with Lex Fridman last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would urge the presidents of both countries to seek a peaceful resolution, saying, ""I can sit with (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell (Ukraine) President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield.""Despite the ongoing conflict, India has continued to buy large quantities of oil from Russia, which has been available at discounted rates due to Western sanctions and reduced demand from Europe. Russia has remained India’s top oil supplier, with India importing 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Russia in February, down from 1.67 million bpd in January.","A warehouse belonging to an indian pharmaceutical company was allegedly struck by a russian missile in ukraine on saturday.

These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs , and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” Trump wrote, referencing media reports suggesting exemptions for electronics like smartphones and semiconductors.The post came amid market jitters and criticism following the administration’s recent shifts on trade. Trump said the US would investigate semiconductors and “the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN” as part of upcoming national security tariff probes. He warned, “We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”Trump’s comments follow a turbulent week in which the White House appeared to soften some tariff positions, rattling markets and prompting a full-throated defence from top officials. On Sunday, White House advisers and Cabinet members fanned out across major television networks in an effort to project calm and continuity in policy, even as Trump’s messaging suggested otherwise.Trump insisted that what some interpreted as exemptions were simply reclassifications. “Those days are over!” he said, referring to decades of perceived trade abuse by China . He pledged that the “Golden Age of America” would bring new tax and regulatory cuts, more jobs, and domestic manufacturing growth.“Our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before,” Trump wrote. “We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”While Trump's team last week defended a shift to a 10% universal tariff on most imports — and a steep 145% tariff on goods from China — their Sunday appearances aimed to reassure voters and businesses of long-term benefits, despite short-term volatility and rising costs.",Us president donald trump on sunday doubled down on his hardline trade stance.

Good time to follow this advice. Over the next 10 days, there are only 4 trading days. It’s not a bad idea to take a break from trading and recharge. Judging by what’s happening, you’re going to need it.

""Trading profitably requires that you monitor the market moods and your psychological moods. When either one is not conducive to trading, it’s best to stand aside and wait for the situation to change. Don’t make the mistake of thinking you should trade even in these potentially debilitating conditions. By staying out of the markets, you can survive to trade another day, when you’re in a peak performance mental state and the market conditions are optimal.""

In a post on X, Kamath pointed to increased market volatility and stressed the need for mental clarity and preparation to trade profitably.Kamath pointed out that over the next 10 days, there are only four trading days due to stock market holidays for Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti and Good Friday.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has responded to the ongoing China and US-meme war on microblogging platform Twitter .

As trade tensions with the two countries escalate, AI-generated videos and memes are going viral.Specifically, these memes target President Donald Trump and his advisers, including Elon Musk and JD Vance. One such viral meme video mocks the idea of American workers returning to garment factories, sparking debate about tariffs and the US manufacturing. The one shared by DogeDesigner is a political cartoon from the Chinese Embassy in the US, depicting the US as a bully forcing China to accept a lollipop while threatening with a spiked bat, symbolizing coercive diplomacy amid escalating US-China trade tensions .Over the past week, tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports have increased from 54% to 104% and then to 125%, in addition to existing duties from before President Trump’s second term. In response, China has raised tariffs on US imports from 84% to 125%, effective April 12, 2025.Recently, Donald Trump announced a two-tier tariff structure: a baseline 10% tariff applied universally to imports from all countries, with exceptions for Canada and Mexico, and additional country-specific ""reciprocal"" tariffs based on what the administration deemed unfair trade practices by approximately 60 individual nations. The 10% baseline tariff began on April 5, 2025, while the higher country-specific rates commenced on April 9, 2025.","Tesla and spacex ceo elon musk responded to the ongoing china and us-meme war on microblogging platform twitter.

""Nobody is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China, which, by far, treats us the worst!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform.Trump’s administration has been engaged in a trade conflict with China, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other’s goods. US tariffs on Chinese imports have reached 145 per cent, while China has responded with a 125 per cent tariff band on American products.On Friday, the US appeared to ease some pressure by announcing temporary tariff exemptions for products such as smartphones, laptops, and semiconductors, many of which are sourced from China. These exemptions are expected to benefit US tech firms like Nvidia, Dell, and Apple, which manufacture several of their products in China.However, President Trump and his aides clarified that these exemptions are not permanent. Trump said on Sunday that the move was being misunderstood and that his administration is working on new tariffs that could apply to items recently exempted. ""The tariffs will be in place in the not distant future,"" he said.Earlier, China’s commerce ministry responded to the exemptions by saying that the move only ""represents a small step"" and urged the US to ""completely cancel"" its entire tariff policy.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a visit to Vietnam at the start of his Southeast Asia tour on Monday, cautioned that protectionist policies ""will lead nowhere.""In an article published in a Vietnamese newspaper, Xi called on both countries to ""resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.""He also repeated China's stance that a ""trade war and tariff war will produce no winner.""","China is under ""severe"" pressure in its export sector, but the situation is not disastrous, a spokesperson said on monday.
