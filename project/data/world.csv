'No nuclear weapons': Trump warns Iran

Iran warns to hit ‘heart of Tel Aviv’



Iran trying to rebuild nuclear sites?







US President Donald Trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against Khamenei-led Iran after talks between Washington and Tehran on curbing Iran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missile development failed to make meaningful progress, people familiar with the matter told CNN.Two US officials briefed on the discussions told Reuters that Trump wants to create conditions for “regime change” targeting the top brass of the Islamic Republic following Iran’s violent crackdown on nationwide protests earlier this month. The unrest, sparked by economic distress and rising prices, was quelled through force, with thousands reportedly killed.According to the sources quoted by Reuters, Trump has discussed options that include targeting Iranian commanders and institutions the US holds responsible for the violence. The aim, they said, would be to embolden protesters and weaken the government’s ability to hold key security and administrative buildings.Trump has publicly warned Tehran as well. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, he demanded that Iran return to the negotiating table to agree to “a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.” He also cautioned that any future US strike would be “far worse” than the one carried out last June under Operation Midnight Hammer, when American forces hit three Iranian nuclear sites.Trump described US naval movements toward the region as an “armada” heading closer to Iran.According to CNN, Trump is weighing a range of military options, including airstrikes targeting Iran’s leadership and security officials linked to the killings, as well as strikes on nuclear facilities and key government institutions. While no final decision has been made, Trump believes his military options have expanded with the arrival of a US carrier strike group in the region earlier this month.Trump's planning on Iran also include to move one or more THAAD missile defence systems to the region, as sources told CNN.The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group entered the Indian Ocean on Monday and is continuing to move closer to Iran. It could support potential military operations, both by assisting in strikes and by protecting US allies in the region from possible Iranian retaliation.Earlier this month, the US and Iran exchanged messages in an effort to ease tensions, sources said. These contacts included mediation by Omani diplomats and direct communication between Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The talks explored the possibility of a meeting to avert a US attack that Trump had threatened following the deaths of protesters.Tehran has issued sharp warnings in response. Iranian officials have said the “heart of Tel Aviv” would be struck if the US attacks Iran. A senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of an “unprecedented” retaliation against Israel in the event of any US military action.It remains unclear why Trump has refocused attention on Iran’s nuclear programme, which he said last summer had been “obliterated” by US strikes. However, according to a person familiar with recent US intelligence, Iran has been trying to rebuild its nuclear facilities deeper underground. Tehran has long resisted US demands to halt uranium enrichment and has also barred the UN’s nuclear watchdog from inspecting its nuclear sites.Amid the growing threat of military action, the US has set strict preconditions for any talks with Iran, sources said. These include a permanent end to uranium enrichment, new limits on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, and a halt to support for Iranian proxy groups across the region.The main obstacle, according to sources, has been Washington’s demand that Iran accept limits on the range of its ballistic missiles — a major concern for Israel, which used up much of its missile interceptor stockpile while defending against Iranian attacks during last June’s 12-day war.Iran has rejected that demand and told the US it would discuss only its nuclear programme. The US has not responded, leaving negotiations at a standstill, the sources said.","Us president donald trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against iran.

"'For official use only': Indian-origin CISA acting director uploaded sensitive government files to public ChatGPT, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/for-official-use-only-indian-origin-cisa-acting-director-madhu-gottumukkala-uploaded-sensitive-government-files-to-public-chatgpt-triggering-security-alarms/articleshow/127736058.cms,"



The acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Madhu Gottumukkala, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings, Politico reported.According to Department of Homeland Security officials, the cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August.One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to govt security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials. It is not clear what the review concluded.None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the officials. However, the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.The incident drew attention because Gottumukkala requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said.The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI.The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”Gottumukkala is currently the senior-most political official at CISA, an agency tasked with securing federal networks against sophisticated, state-backed hackers from adversarial nations, including Russia and China.Any material uploaded into the public version of ChatGPT that Gottumukkala was using is shared with ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, meaning it can be used to help answer prompts from other users of the app. OpenAI has said the app has more than 700 million total active users.Other AI tools now approved for use by DHS employees, such as DHS’s self-built AI-powered chatbot, DHSChat, are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks.Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it,” said the first official.All federal officials are trained on the proper handling of sensitive documents. According to DHS policy, security officials are also supposed to investigate the “cause and affect” of any exposure of official use documents, and determine the “appropriateness” of any administrative or disciplinary action. Depending on the circumstances, those could range from mandatory retraining or a formal warning to more serious measures, such as the suspension or revocation of a security clearance, said one of the four officials.After DHS detected the activity, Gottumukkala spoke with senior officials at DHS to review what he uploaded into ChatGPT, said two of the four officials. DHS’s then-acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara, was involved in the effort to assess any potential harm to the department, according to the first official. Antoine McCord, DHS’s chief information officer, was also involved, according to a second official.Gottumukkala also had meetings this August with CISA’s chief information officer, Robert Costello, and its chief counsel, Spencer Fisher, about the incident and the proper handling of for official use only material, the four people said.Gottumukkala has led the agency in an acting capacity since May, when he was appointed by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as its deputy director. Donald Trump’s nominee to head CISA, DHS special adviser Sean Plankey, was blocked last year by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) over a Coast Guard shipbuilding contract. A date for his new confirmation hearing has not been set.Gottumukkala’s tenure atop the agency has not been smooth, and the ChatGPT incident was not his first security-related matter.At least six career staff were placed on leave this summer after Gottumukkala failed a counterintelligence polygraph exam that he pushed to take, as POLITICO first reported. DHS has called the polygraph “unsanctioned.” Asked during Congressional testimony last week if he was “aware” of the failed test, Gottumukkala twice told Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) that he did not “accept the premise of that characterization. ”Last week, Gottumukkala tried to oust Costello, CISA’s CIO, before other political appointees at the agency intervened to block the move.","Madhu gottumukkala, the acting director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of chatgpt last summer.

Explained: Why Kanye West's swastika apology angered Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-kanye-wests-swastika-apology-angered-hindus/articleshow/127651322.cms,"What Kanye West said

What the Coalition of Hindus of North America said

Why the swastika is repeatedly misunderstood

How Hindus have tried to reclaim the symbol

Why this controversy matters





When US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, published a full-page apology for antisemitic behaviour in The Wall Street Journal, he appeared to be seeking closure after years of controversy. Instead, a single line in the letter reignited a different and older debate, prompting Hindu groups to accuse him of perpetuating a historical misunderstanding that has long stigmatised a sacred religious symbol.In the paid advertisement titled “To Those I’ve Hurt”, Ye apologised for a series of antisemitic remarks, public statements and actions that had led to widespread condemnation and the collapse of several business partnerships.He attributed his behaviour to an undiagnosed frontal-lobe brain injury from a 2002 car accident and to bipolar disorder, describing how prolonged manic episodes caused him to lose touch with reality and exercise poor judgment. Reflecting on his use of Nazi imagery, Ye wrote that in a fractured mental state he “gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika,” and acknowledged selling T-shirts bearing the symbol.While the letter explicitly stated that he is “not a Nazi or an antisemite” and expressed love for Jewish people, it made no distinction between the Nazi emblem and the ancient religious symbol known as the swastika. That omission became the focal point of the backlash.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it “deeply insulting” to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.The organisation said Ye’s apology repeated a basic historical error: Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi symbol as a swastika. The Nazi Party referred to it as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”. According to CoHNA, equating the two symbols collapses vastly different historical and civilisational contexts into a single narrative of hate.CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified. While acknowledging Ye’s attempt to apologise for antisemitic harm, the group said accountability must not come at the cost of misrepresenting living religious traditions.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism is largely the result of early 20th-century Western reporting. As Nazi Germany rose to power, English-language media frequently translated Hakenkreuz as “swastika” for convenience, even though the Nazis themselves did not use that term.Over time, repetition turned that mistranslation into convention. In Western public consciousness, the word “swastika” became almost exclusively associated with Nazism, eclipsing its far older presence across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, where it symbolises auspiciousness, continuity and well-being.Historians argue that this collapse of meaning distorts history in two directions. Nazi ideology is inaccurately described when its own terminology is ignored, while Dharmic traditions are harmed when their sacred symbols are reduced to shorthand for European fascism. Precision, they say, is essential not only for cultural sensitivity but for historical accuracy.In recent years, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups have stepped up efforts to reclaim and contextualise the swastika through education campaigns, interfaith dialogue and legal advocacy. These initiatives aim to explain the difference between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, particularly in schools, museums and public discourse.Some of these efforts have translated into legislative recognition in parts of North America, where lawmakers have formally acknowledged the distinction between the two symbols. Community leaders stress that reclaiming the swastika is not about downplaying Nazi atrocities, but about preventing an ancient religious emblem from being permanently defined by its 20th-century misuse.For practitioners, the issue is deeply personal. The swastika continues to be used in daily worship, festivals, weddings and rites of passage. Its mischaracterisation shapes public perception and, at times, exposes communities to suspicion or hostility.Ye’s apology illustrates how historical misunderstandings can persist even in moments intended to heal. For Hindu organisations, the issue is not the artist’s intent, but the ease with which a global public figure could repeat an error that scholars and communities have spent decades trying to correct.The episode underscores a broader lesson history offers repeatedly: when symbols are flattened and stripped of context, attempts to confront one injustice can end up creating another. As debates around hate, memory and accountability continue, Hindu groups argue that accuracy is not a technicality. It is the foundation of understanding.","Us rapper kanye west published a full-page apology for antisemitic behaviour in the wall street journal.

Who is Stephen Miller? The figure at the center of the storm



What’s next in the fallout between Megyn Kelly and Kara Swisher







A sharp social media clash erupted this week between prominent American media figures over a controversial comparison made about former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. Megyn Kelly, conservative commentator and host of, reacted with outrage to a clip shared by tech journalist Kara Swisher, comparing Miller to historical figures associated with grave abuses of power. Kelly characterised this comment as dangerously extreme and potentially life-threatening.In a tweet on early Wednesday morning, Kelly wrote, “This is SICK. She’s trying to get @StephenM killed. Why else would you say he’s Himmler? Deranged and so far beyond the pale. We can’t become immune to it (sic)” amplifying the controversy and drawing intense reactions across the political spectrum.The dispute began with a video clip from thepodcast, hosted by Swisher and Scott Galloway, in which Swisher delivered a blistering critique of Miller’s role in shaping immigration policy, calling him akin to Nazis involved in internment and genocide. In the clip, Swisher said that Miller was similar to figures like Heinrich Himmler and Karl Bendetsen, the latter of whom orchestrated Japanese-American internment camps during World War II. Swisher argued that Miller would “go down in history as evil” and claimed that he had “blood on his hands. ”Swisher’s broader point was to highlight what she views as a moral responsibility for decisions in immigration enforcement, especially amid intense scrutiny of federal immigration actions that have drawn national criticism recently.Her comments, however, touched off a backlash from conservative circles.Kelly, a long-time political commentator who hosts a nationally syndicated show, seized on the video clip and accused Swisher of a rhetoric which was so incendiary that it could put Miller’s life at risk. In her tweet, she called the comparison to Himmler “sick” and “deranged”, arguing that such language can incite violence against political figures.Her tweet rapidly became a focal point of discussion across social platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), with supporters praising her defence of Miller and critics accusing Kelly of overreaction or mischaracterising Swisher’s intent. The debate taps into a larger political battle over public speech boundaries. Conservatives often argue that aggressive criticism from the left dehumanises political opponents, while progressives and critics of Miller’s policies argue that sharp comparisons are a legitimate response to what they see as harmful government conduct.Social media erupted almost instantly as Kelly’s tweet spread. Many conservatives applauded her call-out, sharing the post widely and framing Swisher’s comments as irresponsible or even violent in tone. Others on the political right used the moment to critique what they see as a double standard in how political rhetoric is judged when directed at liberal versus conservative figures online.Meanwhile, some commentators and journalists criticised Kelly’s characterisation, arguing that Swisher’s comments, while hyperbolic, were not literally advocating harm but instead using historical comparisons to underscore perceived moral failures in public policy. The clash highlights the increasingly fraught nature of political commentary in the social media age, where a single tweet can ignite broad national debates about rhetoric, responsibility and political civility.While one netizen commented, ""Millions agree with her, including yours truly (sic)"", another tweeted, ""Go f*** yourself @megynkellyYou are as disgusting as ever. And it's a very fair comparison. It's on fucking believable that you can show that motherf***** sympathy, but you trash Alex Perretti, who was actually a really good person (sic)"" and yet another reacted, ""Dems are losing their tiny minds everywhere!

‘ALL-OUT WAR IS FINAL!’: Iran’s Ultimate Warning To U.S As Trump Warships Besiege Iran





President Donald Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal with the US or face military strikes far worse than the attack he ordered last June, ratcheting up pressure on the regime.

‘Alex Pretti Killing Sad, I Love His Family’: Trump For ‘HONEST’ Probe Into Minneapolis ICE Shooting

President had said he

President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned the mayor of Minneapolis –– where the brutal killings of two US protesters by immigration agents sparked nationwide outrage –– that he is “playing with fire. ”Trump told Mayor Jacob Frey that his refusal to cooperate with federal authorities on rooting out suspected illegal immigrants was “a very serious violation of the law.”The statement on President Trump’s Truth Social platform contradicted the 79-year-old Republican president’s earlier statement that he wanted to “de-escalate.”A top hard-line White House official retreated late Tuesday on his initial attempt to justify the shooting of a protester Saturday. And Trump shuffled the leadership of immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, putting a less confrontational figure in charge.But the Minnesota city remains the focal point for national tensions over the immigration crackdown.While the White House insists that it is targeting hardened criminals, the use of masked, heavily armed men to snatch people from streets, homes and workplaces has caused widespread shock.Top Trump aide Stephen Miller initially justified Pretti’s killing by branding him a “would-be assassin” but later acknowledged that the agents who killed Pretti “may not have been following protocol.”","Mayor jacob frey's refusal to cooperate with federal authorities was “a very serious violation of the law,” trump said.

Criminal background

""Might get arrested"": Sends cryptic note to neighbour

Pro-Trump





The man accused of spraying Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) with an apple cider vinegar during a town hall in her district Tuesday had a lengthy criminal history and appeared to show support for President Trump on social media.Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, was tackled to the ground after police said he used a syringe to spray an unknown liquid, which had not yet been identified, onto Omar. He was arrested and booked into the Hennepin County Jail on a third-degree assault charge.Minnesota court records indicated that Kazmierczak was arrested multiple times over the past three decades, dating back to a felony conviction for motor vehicle theft in 1989. He was also charged with driving under the influence on several occasions and other misdemeanor traffic violations, according to the Hills citing records.A livestream of Tuesday’s incident showed Kazmierczak standing and yelling at Omar, who was standing at a podium a few feet away, calling for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over her handling of immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota.Omar continued with the town hall after Kazmierczak was taken from the room, saying Minnesotans would “stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.”She later wrote on the social platform X that she was OK and would not be intimidated.“I’m ok. I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from my doing work. I don’t let bullies win. Grateful to my incredible constituents who rallied behind me. Minnesota strong,” Omar wrote.An alleged neighbour of Kazmierczak told the New York Post that the man had hinted he “might get arrested” at the event in a text asking if the neighbour could watch his dog while he went to see Omar speak.The neighbour also told the Post that his neighbour had been “heavily medicated” due to a spine injury suffered during a car wreck years ago, and that Kazmierczak had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.A review of Kazmierczak’s social media demonstrated support for conservative causes and Trump, including changing his profile picture in late September to a photo of the president hugging Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk.The Associated Press reported that Kazmierczak referred to Democrats as “angry and liars” in social media posts and made critical comments about former President Biden.“Trump wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” Kazmierczak reportedly wrote in one post. “Stop other countries from stealing from us. Bring back the fear that enemies back away from and gain respect that If anyone threatens ourselves or friends we will (expletive) them up.”Several Republican lawmakers quickly condemned the incident, with Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) calling it “completely unacceptable,” and Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) saying she was “disturbed” by the attack.“Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric – and I do – no elected official should face physical attacks,” Mace wrote on X.Trump, who repeatedly used xenophobic rhetoric against Omar, struck a different tone Wednesday, suggesting, without evidence, that the incident was staged.“I don’t think about her. I think she’s a fraud,” Trump told ABC News. “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”","Anthony kazmierczak, 55, is accused of spraying rep. ilhan omar (d-minn.) with an apple cider vinegar during a town hall in her district tuesday.

Broader implications for higher education





A California university professor has warned that a freeze on new H-1B visa petitions could weaken higher education in Texas and across the US, arguing that international recruitment has been central to the success of leading universities. In a widely shared post, Jelani Nelson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said restricting access to global talent would damage research quality and long-term academic competitiveness.Nelson was responding to a directive by Texas Governor Greg Abbott instructing state agencies and public universities to pause new H-1B visa petitions. Abbott said the move was intended to prioritise jobs for Texans. Nelson countered that elite universities operate in a global talent market and that limiting international hiring risks eroding academic standards rather than strengthening local opportunity.To support his argument, Nelson shared examples of prominent foreign-born academics who taught or worked at the University of Texas at Austin, noting that their careers illustrate how international scholars have historically shaped Texas’ research reputation.He stressed that the list reflects scholarly impact, not visa status.A Turing Award winner, Dijkstra was one of the founders of modern computer science. He introduced core ideas in algorithms, structured programming and concurrent systems. His shortest-path algorithm remains essential in navigation software, networking and logistics. During his time at the University of Texas at Austin, he helped shape rigorous approaches to software design, influenced generations of computer scientists and strengthened the university’s reputation as a centre for theoretical and practical computing.An Abel Prize–winning mathematician, Caffarelli is a global authority on nonlinear partial differential equations. His work underpins models used in fluid dynamics, materials science and climate research. At US universities, including work connected to Texas institutions, his presence raised research standards and drew top graduate students. He helped strengthen collaboration between mathematics, physics and engineering, boosting the international standing of American and Texas-based mathematics programmes.Sudarshan was a leading figure in theoretical physics whose work reshaped quantum optics and particle theory. He co-developed ideas central to modern quantum optics and advanced understanding of weak interactions. At the University of Texas at Austin, he helped build a strong theoretical physics culture. His mentorship trained generations of physicists and elevated UT Austin’s reputation as a serious centre for advanced physics research.Prigogine won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for explaining how order can emerge in systems far from equilibrium. His ideas influenced chemistry, biology, economics and complexity science. Through his ties to US academia, he encouraged interdisciplinary research that crossed traditional boundaries. American universities benefited by becoming leaders in the study of complex systems, self-organisation and non-linear processes.MacDonald is a Wolf Prize–winning physicist known for groundbreaking work in condensed matter theory. His research has guided experimental advances in superconductivity and quantum materials. At UT Austin, he helped build one of the world’s strongest condensed matter theory groups. His presence attracted elite researchers, major funding and international recognition, strengthening Texas’ position in advanced physics research.Torii is a leading plant biologist whose research explains how plants regulate growth and respond to stress. Her work has direct relevance to crop resilience, food security and climate adaptation. At US universities, she strengthened plant and environmental biology programmes. Her research helped position academic institutions to contribute practical solutions to global agricultural and sustainability challenges.Georgiou is a biotechnology pioneer whose work bridges academic research and medical application. He has co-invented more than 150 patents and helped develop enzyme-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. At UT Austin, he played a key role in building a strong bioengineering ecosystem. His work boosted industry partnerships, startup creation and the real-world impact of university research.Nelson warned that restricting early-career entry routes into academia could have long-term consequences, as many leading scholars begin their US careers through temporary visa pathways before becoming internationally recognised figures. He argued that narrowing these pathways risks weakening research capacity at top universities.The post has sparked debate online, with critics pointing to alternative visa categories for elite academics and supporters warning that limiting access to international talent could undermine the foundations of US higher education. The exchange reflects a wider national debate over immigration policy, labour priorities and the role of global talent in sustaining academic excellence.","Jelani nelson, a computer science professor at the university of california, berkeley, said restricting access to global talent would damage research quality and long-term academic competitiveness.

Silicon Valley billionaires Elon Musk and Vinod Khosla continued their social media spat after Musk had posted a comment about white people, prompting a reaction from Indian-origin Khosla.Musk’s initial post said: “White people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population.”Khosla responded by accusing Musk of promoting a racial agenda in the US and asked all non-White people to quit Musk's companies. He wrote: “Elon Musk doesn't want MAGA, he wants WAGA or 'white America great again' as a racism is great and desirable paradigm. All non-whites in Tesla, SpaceX, X etc and all decent whites should quit and join our portfolio. Email us your linkedin!”Musk hit back by saying his partner and son, too, are linked to India, to prove he is not exactly a White supremacist: “Vinod, you’re not just such a pompous a**hole that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house, you’ve also gone full r***d. My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honour of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”Musk’s partner, Shivon Alice Zilis, is a Canadian technology executive and venture capitalist. She was born to a Punjabi Indian mother and a Canadian father. Musk’s eldest son with Zilis carries a name paying tribute to Indian-American scientist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.Khosla later responded by urging Musk to avoid bringing his family into the dispute and to reconsider his public comments on race.He wrote: “Instead of bringing your family into it, maybe try not tweeting ‘SEEMINGLY’ racist stuff next time? Many would appreciate it if you acknowledge you are not trying to establish a white society in America, and are not WAGA, and racism isn’t behind your many laments around white birth rates, declining % of population and many similar laments. ""Khosla then addressed the personal jibe that Elon had launched at him: ""As to the beach issue you’d appreciate me standing up to the principle of defending ‘the principal of private property’ instead of giving in to whatever the Coastal Commission wants. EVERY court ruling (in Friends of Martin Beach case including all appeals) so far reaffirms there has NEVER been free access to the beach thru private property, just paid access for parking, though the beach is public property (I’ve never asserted it isn’t). You would appreciate it if you knew the facts. Anything else is communism. Separately, courts have denied my petition to have the right to close the gate because the CCC has not denied me the right to close the gate and wont give me a hearing for years because then they would have to deny my petition and I would have legal recourse. So they just wont give me a hearing date.""However, Khosla praised Musk at the end of his long reply: ""Unfortunately I have no proof to refute your claim that I am a pompous asshole and retarded. I have said publicly I do admire your extraordinary entrepreneurial skills.”The beach dispute refers to Khosla’s purchase of land near Martin’s Beach in Half Moon Bay, California, in 2008. He erected a gate on a road that had provided public access to the beach to block visitors. Legal battles followed, with a court ruling that Khosla must allow public access to the beach road. He faced backlash and people accused him of preventing the public from enjoying a shared space. But Khosla defended his actions as protecting private property rights.Khosla is an Indian-American billionaire entrepreneur born in Pune in 1955. He co-founded Sun Microsystems, spent 18 years at Kleiner Perkins, and later founded Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm focused on technology, biotech, energy, and AI. His net worth is over $9 billion.",Elon musk and vinod khosla continued their social media spat after musk had posted a comment about white people.

A preliminary Department of Homeland Security report sent to Congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on January 24, according to notices obtained by multiple news outlets.Both the agents were placed on administrative leave, according to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. MS Now was first to report that detail, NBC news reported.The preliminary report, from a Customs and Border Protection internal investigation led by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was sent to congressional committees Tuesday, including the House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, according to three sources.The DHS report said that during the encounter January 24, an officer yelled “He’s got a gun!” multiple times and then “approximately five seconds later a BPA [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO [Customs and Border Protection officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti.”It was unclear from the report whether the bullets from both officers’ guns hit Pretti.The report also did not make any mention of Pretti attacking officers or brandishing a gun, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed in the aftermath of the shooting.Multiple videos recorded by eyewitnesses that were verified and analysed by NBC News showed Pretti did not hold a weapon during the struggle as he was surrounded by agents. One video showed that a federal agent removed a gun from Pretti's waist area just before he was shot.The report said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent said he had possession of Pretti's gun, which was then secured in his vehicle.A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence"" Sunday, after state investigators were denied access to the crime scene.The report said its findings were based on CBP documents and body-camera from officers on the scene.It said that officers were ""conducting enforcement actions"" in Minneapolis on Saturday morning as part of Operation Metro Surge, near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 25th Street.The operation saw some 3,000 federal officers and agents deployed to Minnesota, while the Minneapolis Police Department had just 600 officers, as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on migrant communities and what federal officials said was an attempt to stamp out local corruption and fraud.The surge was met with strong local opposition and protests, particularly after a local woman, Renee Good, was shot dead by an immigration officer while at the wheel of her car January 7.""Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway,"" the report into Pretti's death said.An officer was then ""confronted"" by two women blowing whistles who failed to comply with an order to move out of the road, according to the report. After the officer pushed them both away, it said, one of them ran to a man the report identified as Pretti.The officer continued to attempt to move the woman and Pretti out of the road before using his pepper spray on them both, the report said.""CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel’s efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He’s got a gun!' multiple times,"" the report said.Approximately five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a CBP officer both fired shots at Pretti, according to the report.At 9:02 a.m., CBP staff cut Pretti's clothes and provided first aid including placing chest seals on his wounds, before fire department medics arrived two minutes later, the report said.He was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center at approximately 9:32 a.m.","Preliminary report sent to congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of alex pretti in minneapolis on january 24.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.",Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (pti) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister imran khan. The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127700356,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-762057,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
