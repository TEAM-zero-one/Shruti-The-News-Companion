No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister khawaja asif says country may no longer need imf help in six months.

500% tariffs ahead for India & China?

Also read:

Also read:

US President Donald Trump has approved a new bill that allows massive duties on countries that import Russian petroleum products. The bill, 'Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025' threatens at least 500% tariffs on countries that ""knowingly engage in the exchange. "" US senator Lindsey Graham said that the bill, which is now headed for bipartisan approval aims to punish nations “who buy cheap Russian oil,” a move that could directly impact India’s energy imports and further strain its trade ties with Washington.The proposed legislation sets out sweeping punitive measures that would be triggered if the US President finds that Russian government or a person acting at Russia's direction refuses to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine. The measures will also be revoked in case a negotiated peace agreement is violated, another invasion of Ukraine or involved with overthrowing is initiated, dismantling, or seeking to subvert the Ukrainian government.The bill states that Trump ""must increase the rate of duty on all goods and services imported into the United States from countries that knowingly engage in the exchange of Russian-origin uranium and petroleum products to at least 500% relative to the value of such goods and services.""In his post on X, Graham said, ""After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others."" Explaining the crucial timing of the bill, the executive further added, ""Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent.""""This bill will allow President Trump to punish those countries who buy cheap Russian oil fueling Putin’s war machine. This bill would give President Trump tremendous leverage against countries like China, India and Brazil to incentivize them to stop buying the cheap Russian oil that provides the financing for Putin’s bloodbath against Ukraine.""Earlier this week, Graham said that India was urging Washington to roll back steep tariffs imposed in August 2025, over the same issue. Graham claimed that India’s ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, met him last month to highlight New Delhi’s reduced purchases of Russian oil and to seek relief from the additional 25% duties.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One alongside Trump, the senator said, “I was at the Indian Ambassador's house a month ago, and all he wanted to talk about was how India is buying less Russian oil. And he asked me to tell the President to relieve the 25% tariff.” The tariffs were imposed in August, with the US arguing that India’s energy trade with Russia was indirectly supporting Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. With the extra levy, total duties on certain Indian goods rose to 50%.Trump has openly acknowledged that the tariffs have strained ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Addressing the House GOP Member Retreat, he said PM Modi was unhappy with the trade measures but pointed to a reduction in oil imports from Russia. “He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now because they’re not doing the oil, but they are — they’ve now reduced it very substantially, as you know, from Russia,” Trump said.The US President has repeatedly warned India that tariffs could be increased further if it does not “help on the Russian oil issue,” directly linking trade pressure to the Russia–Ukraine conflict. He has argued that India’s purchases of discounted Russian crude fuel Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.India, however, has maintained a firm stance, rejecting Trump’s earlier claim that PM Modi had assured him New Delhi would stop buying Russian oil, clarifying that no such conversation took place. As Washington moves closer to advancing the sanctions bill, the proposed legislation could raise fresh uncertainty for India.At the same time, Trump has positioned himself as a potential broker in the Russia–Ukraine war, holding talks with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though without any concrete breakthrough so far.","Trump clears russia sanctions bill, 500% tariff threat looms as india reworks oil import strategy.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in india to temporarily suspend visa services.

Sawaal poochhne ka waqt kab ka nikal chuka hai.

History might disagree, at least in the cinematic verse. Everything repeats, and the return of angry young men on screen is one such phenomena. And so is the hyper nationalistic movies.Half a century ago, that line fromdidn’t just earn applause — it gave voice to a generation’s anger. Today, that anger is back in Indian cinema, louder, bloodier and far more profitable. Withstorming the box office and rewriting records week after week, the return of the angry young man is no longer a creative coincidence. It is a cultural moment. But this time, the anger isn’t quite pointing in the same direction.Released on December 5,has only begun to slow down in its fifth week after a month-long, record-breaking run. The Ranveer Singh-led film, featuring Arjun Rampal, R Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt and Akshaye Khanna, has crossed the lifetime collections ofand. It has stayed remarkably strong despite competition from Hollywood spectacleand Hindi releases such asand. Its success is not just about scale or star power — it signals how deeply the angry male protagonist has re-entered the mainstream imagination.From here, Indian cinema’s relationship with anger, power and masculinity tells a story that is as political as it is cinematic.The template was set in the 1970s against the backdrop of Emergency. In, Amitabh Bachchan’s Vijay Khanna tells the system exactly where it stands. In, when asked to choose between law and loyalty, he delivers one of Hindi cinema’s most enduring lines: “Mere paas maa hai.” It wasn’t bravado. It was a moral position.The angry young man of that era was shaped by a country struggling with inflation, unemployment, labour unrest and widespread corruption. Films like(1975),(1979) and(1981) were steeped in a sense of betrayal. The state had promised dignity and justice; instead, it delivered scarcity and indifference.These protagonists were anti-establishment by design. They didn’t trust institutions because institutions had failed them. When Bachchan growled, “Aaj khush toh bahut hoge tum,” it was a class confrontation. Film scholars often describe this phase using Antonio Gramsci’s idea of counter-hegemony: cinema became a site where the working class could symbolically push back against dominant power structures.Violence existed, but it was rarely celebratory. The angry young man was tragic, burdened by his choices, aware that justice came at a cost.Fast forward to the last decade, and the angry man is back—bigger, louder and more commercially potent than ever. Films likeandhave drawn massive audiences across languages.But listen closely to what these men are angry about.In, the protagonist declares, “Jo mera nahi ho sakta, woh kisi aur ka bhi nahi ho sakta.” His rage isn’t directed at a broken system but at a woman who refuses to conform. In, Ranbir Kapoor’s character boasts, “Papa ke liye main kuch bhi kar sakta hoon,” as familial obsession morphs into unchecked violence. The films don’t question these impulses—they aestheticise them.Even in, when Allu Arjun swaggers through the forest declaring, “Pushpa naam sunke flower samjhe kya? Fire hai main,” the line captures the shift. Pushpa doesn’t dismantle corruption; he perfects it. His rebellion is not against power, but against exclusion from power.Similarly,’s Rocky doesn’t dream of reform. He dreams of domination. His worldview is summed up in the idea that power must be seized and held at any cost, not questioned or redistributed.This is the crucial difference between the angry men of the 1970s and today. Earlier heroes fought corrupt systems because those systems denied dignity. Today’s heroes often aspire to control the system itself.Film theory helps explain this turn. Where earlier cinema channelled collective anger, contemporary films reflect a more individualistic worldview. Neoliberal masculinity—where success is personal, dominance is virtue, and empathy is weakness—has found a powerful visual language in popular cinema.The audience response is telling. Viewers cheer not because the hero questions authority, but because he exercises it without restraint. Anger has shifted from resistance to entitlement.Running parallel to this trend is the rise of overtly pro-state films. Titles such asandhave framed the state as decisive, morally upright and beyond scrutiny.In, the line “How’s the josh?” became a national catchphrase—not of protest, but of affirmation. The cinema of anger, once suspicious of power, now often works in sync with it.Political communication scholars note that popular culture doesn’t merely mirror public sentiment—it helps shape it. When rage is directed outward at designated enemies rather than upward at systems of power, it reinforces the status quo rather than challenging it.Since Dhurandhar divided people over whether to appreciate the filmmaking of it or criticise the propaganda of it, Hindi film industry actor Hrithik Roshan put it the right way: “I may disagree with the politics of it, and argue about the responsibilities us filmmakers should bear as citizens of the world. Nevertheless, can’t ignore how I loved and learnt from this one as a student of cinema. Amazing.”Andhadhun actor Radhika Apte too, recently expressed concern over the rise in violence in Indian cinema.""I'm deeply disturbed by the violence at the moment that is selling as entertainment,"" said Apte in an interview with the Hollywood reporter. She did not shy away from calling out violence against women in films.""I find it disturbing that actresses are doing films that demean women,"" she said, calling for collective responsibility. ""I think we need to collectively stop doing them. They might be throwing money at you, but you're rich already. We need to stop because this is very harmful.""The angry men are back. They dominate box office charts, shape popular culture and command extraordinary influence. But unlike their predecessors, they no longer ask uncomfortable questions of power.The angry young man of the 1970s emerged from social fracture and spoke to collective injustice. Today’s angry man thrives on certainty—certain of his right to control, to punish, to dominate. His rage does not unsettle the system; it often reinforces it.Ascontinues its theatrical run, it prompts a larger question for Indian cinema: Is this a revival of rebellion, or has authority simply been repackaged in the language of anger?Well, Naseeruddin Shah's character inputs it right:","Ranveer singh-led film, featuring arjun rampal, r madhavan, sanjay dutt and akshaye khanna, has crossed the lifetime collections ofand. Success is not just about scale or star power — it signals how deeply the angry male protagonist has re-entered the mainstream imagination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126415870,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-997117,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

NEW DELHI: The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) is not fully satisfied with X's initial response to its notice on the alleged misuse of AI chatbot Grok and is likely to seek clearer, step-by-step details on corrective measures the platform plans to implement, govt sources said on Thursday.Officials said X's reply to the Jan 2 notice had relied on broad assurances of policy enforcement and user liability but fell short of spelling out specific technological and operational safeguards to prevent generation of obscene and non-consensual content, including sexualised images of women and minors. ""The response is generic in nature. The ministry is going to ask for specific steps - what changes will be made, how quickly and how they will be enforced,"" a source said.The development comes after X sought more days beyond the 72-hour deadline set by MeitY to submit a detailed action taken report"". A govt official had earlier told TOI the platform requested additional time and govt remained ""hopeful of a positive outcome"" given X's global footprint.The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using Grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images by feeding publicly available photos into the chatbot. A Reuters report last week said the platform was flooded with such content, raising concerns over AI-enabled abuse.Amid the scrutiny, X owner Elon Musk warned that users generating illegal content through Grok would face consequences. MeitY has said failure to comply with directives could lead to the withdrawal of safe-harbour protections.","The issue escalated after a viral ""bikini"" trend, which saw users allegedly using grok to generate sexualised or manipulated images.

Donald Trump Pulls US Out Of India-Led Solar Alliance In Sweeping Exit From 66 Global Agencies

US move coincides with call for defence budget rise





In a sweeping overhaul of America's global footprint, President Donald Trump has authorised the withdrawal of US from 66 international organisations, marking one of the most significant retreats from multilateralism in modern history.The pullout is from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though the withdrawal from ISA, a collaborative initiative of India and France to increase solar footprints globally, will not affect the alliance's key goal, the move came as a surprise as the Trump administration had never hinted at it after withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change.The withdrawal, announced on Jan 7 via a presidential memorandum, affects 31 United Nations entities and 35 non-UN groups, including key bodies focused on health and education. This action coincides with Trump's call for a $1.5 trillion defence budget in fiscal year 2027, a staggering 50% increase over current levels, fuelling debates about a shift towards a ""Fortress America"" doctrine that prioritises domestic strength, protectionism over global engagement.The withdrawals build on an executive order issued shortly after Trump's inauguration in Jan 2025, which directed a review of US participation in international bodies deemed contrary to national interests. Prominent targets include Unesco, which the US had briefly rejoined under the previous administration; and potentially WHO, echoing Trump's first-term defunding over alleged biases toward China.Other entities span trade, human rights, and environmental forums, with the state department citing a total of 66 as ""wasteful, ineffective, or harmful"". In some cases, Washington has formally withdrawn; in others, it has suspended funding, reduced diplomatic engagement or signalled an intention to exit when legal timelines allow.Administration officials say these organisations ""no longer serve American interests"" and often promote policies seen as hostile or inefficient. For instance, climate-related bodies are criticised for imposing undue burdens on US business and industry without reciprocal commitments from ""major emitters"" like China and India, even though their per capita emission is a fraction of American emissions. Unesco and similar groups face accusations of waste and mismanagement, with secretary of state Marco Rubio highlighting redundancy and a lack of tangible benefits for US taxpayers.Trump himself has framed the decisions as part of his ""America First"" agenda, arguing that funds previously allocated to these entities - estimated at billions annually - should be redirected domestically to address border security, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Supporters, including Republican lawmakers, applaud the move as a correction to decades of overcommitment, freeing resources amid a national debt heading towards $40 trillion.Foreign policy experts point to the Dec 2025 National Security Strategy, which critiques US allies in Europe and Asia for insufficient burden-sharing while prioritising unilateral actions. The document, released under Trump's direction, describes an ""America First"" framework that sceptics label as neo-isolationist, though administration officials insist it avoids outright withdrawal from core alliances like Nato, which is also under siege from Washington over the Greenland issue.This approach is straining US ties across the globe: European leaders have decried the US exits as a blow to collective security, while adversaries like Russia and China are relishing the perceived vacuum. Partners like India, Japan, and Australia have been hung out to dry. Analysts argue the policy fosters adversity by undermining multilateralism, with some of them warning that Trump's strategy risks damaging US power, economy, and security through hostility toward global cooperation.The proposed $1.5 trillion defence budget, unveiled on Jan 7, underscores this pivot. Trump justified the hike - up from the current $1 trillion - as essential for building a ""dream military"", with allocations for nuclear modernisation, missile defence, and cyber capabilities.","Us withdraws from 66 global organisations, including un framework convention on climate change and international solar alliance.

: With no end in sight for Washington's tariff tangle with India, more trouble appears to be looming for New Delhi after US President Donald Trump green-lit Wednesday a sweeping bipartisan legislation that will authorise him to slap primary and secondary sanctions as well as punitive tariffs up to 500% on Moscow and countries that still buy oil from Russia.The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal Bill after the senators sponsoring it, would significantly raise pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India and Brazil, all part of Brics, which have so far withstood current US sanctions and tariffs.By legislatively empowering Trump beyond his current executive authority, lawmakers, in conjunction with White House, are also trying to get ahead of a US Supreme Court ruling in the tariff case - likely this month - that is widely expected to go against the administration.""This bill will allow President Trump to punish countries who buy cheap Russian oil fuelling Putin's war machine... give him tremendous leverage against... China, India and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the oil that provides finance for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,"" Senator Lindsey Graham posted on X after a meeting where he said Trump green-lit passage of the legislation.Graham said there could be “a strong bipartisan vote, hopefully as early as next week”.The legislation grew out of mounting frustration in the White House and Congress that existing sanctions have failed to change the Kremlin’s behaviour.Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, long among the Senate’s most outspoken advocates for Ukraine, argue that Russia has adapted to earlier measures by rerouting energy exports to willing buyers at discounted prices. By targeting those buyers directly with even higher tariffs and sanctions, they say, Washington can close the loopholes that have allowed Moscow to keep financing its war.The bill enjoys significant bipartisan backing in Congress. Introduced in Sept 2025, it advanced through the senate foreign relations committee in Oct 2025 by a strong vote, signalling broad consensus. By Dec, with 85 co-sponsors in the Senate alone, it spurred companion legislation in the House even as the Trump tariffs, imposed through executive power, were challenged and rejected in lower courts before the matter reached the Supreme Court.Trump, who was initially reluctant to back the legislation, believing he had enough executive authority, appears to have changed course after the judicial setbacks. In comments during a golf outing with Graham in late 2025, he had expressed support for tougher sanctions but urged caution to avoid derailing negotiations with Putin. He reportedly insisted on reviewing the final text of the legislation, emphasising that it should not “tank the global economy” while targeting Russia’s oil revenues.Trump’s endorsement marks a shift from earlier ambivalence, where he prioritised diplomacy over escalation. While concerns remain about potential economic fallout of the legislation on the US itself, including solidifying the Brics bloc and accelerating its de-dollarisation efforts, the momentum behind the bill reflects a rare convergence of Republican and Democratic views on Russia.","The proposed sanctioning russia act, simply called the graham-blumenthal bill after the senators sponsoring it, would significantly raise pressure on russia and countries such as china, india and brazil.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday kicked off the Somnath Swabhiman Parv, sharing pictures from his visit to the Somnath temple in 2001 and describing the year-long celebrations as a tribute to country's civilisational resilience.In a post on X, the Prime Minister said the Somnath Swabhiman Parv is about remembering “the countless children of Bharat Mata, who never compromised with their principles and ethos,” even in the most challenging times.“Jai Somnath! Somnath Swabhiman Parv begins today. A thousand years ago, in January 1026, Somnath faced its first-ever attack. The attack of 1026 and the subsequent attacks couldn't diminish the eternal faith of millions, nor break the civilisational spirit that rebuilt Somnath time and again,” PM Modi wrote.He added, “#SomnathSwabhimanParv is about remembering the countless children of Bharat Mata, who never compromised with their principles and ethos. However daunting the times were, their resolve remained unshaken and their commitment to our ethos unwavering.”The Prime Minister also shared glimpses from a programme held at Somnath on October 31, 2001, when the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the Somnath temple was commemorated.“I am also sharing with you some glimpses of a program organized in Somnath on October 31, 2001. That was the year when we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the Somnath Temple, which was reconstructed in 1951. In 1951, that historic ceremony was held in the presence of the then President Dr. Rajendra Prasad Ji. The efforts of great personalities including Sardar Patel and KM Munshi Ji in the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple were extremely commendable,” he said.PM Modi noted that the 2001 programme was attended by several senior leaders, including then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and then Home Minister L. K. Advani.“In this program of the year 2001, the then Prime Minister Atal Ji and Home Minister Advani Ji and many dignitaries had participated. In the year 2026, we are also commemorating the 75th anniversary of the grand ceremony that took place in 1951!,” he added.The Somnath temple at Veraval in Gujarat was reconstructed in 1951, with the inauguration ceremony held in the presence of then President Rajendra Prasad, following efforts led by leaders such as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and K. M. Munshi.PM Modi is scheduled to visit the Somnath Temple on January 11 to take part in the Somnath Swabhiman Parv celebrations.The Somnath Swabhiman Parv will be observed from January 8 to January 11, during which a series of programmes highlighting India’s spiritual heritage, cultural pride and social values will be organised.",The somnath swabhiman parv will be observed from january 8 to january 11.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered a full forensic examination of a controversial 48-minute audio recording that allegedly shows former Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh 's involvement in the 2023 ethnic violence. The court directed the National Forensic Science University (NFSU) in Gandhinagar to analyze both the complete audio and Singh's admitted voice samples, with results to be submitted in a sealed cover, as reported by PTI.“The entire 48 minutes of the conversation in question along with the admitted voice recordings of the former Manipur CM are available... All the voice recordings furnished to the respondents by the learned counsel for the petitioner shall also be included therewith and forwarded to the National Forensic Science University Gandhinagar,” ordered the bench ordered.The case, which has been listed about 10 times, gained new momentum when lawyer Prashant Bhushan, representing the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights (KOHUR) Trust, presented the complete transcript. The state government, through Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, only recently received the full recording.This fresh examination comes after earlier controversy when the NFSU initially gave a clean chit, claiming the audio clips were tampered with. The court had expressed concern in December that only selected portions were previously analysed instead of the complete recording.The petition alleges that Biren Singh played a key role in violence against the Kuki-Zo community.According to lawyer Bhushan, the recorded conversation suggests state machinery's involvement in the ethnic clashes that killed over 260 people and displaced thousands since May 2023.The violence erupted after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' protested the Manipur High Court's order on Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status. Singh, who resigned as chief minister in February 2024 amid political pressure, is accused by KOHUR of orchestrating violence against Kuki-dominated areas.",Supreme court orders forensic examination of 48-minute audio recording.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan. We'd very much appreciate your feedback on the attached one-page outline of ways forward in US-Pakistan relationship - Did we miss anything or would anything sound off-key in Washington? Separately, do you think we could try again to schedule a meeting with Eric to discuss and hear his perspectives on how best to move the relationship forward? Finally, I'd appreciate the opportunity to speak with you or a member of your team on FATF, in order to better understand the lay of the land. ""The firm is said to have circulated documents in diplomatic circles on behalf of Pak ""appreciating constructive role played by US and President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of J&K"". The documents sought ""critical minerals agreement"" and bilateral relations with US independent of ties with its neighbours, shortly after Operation Sindoor.","Us fara filings expose how pakistan lobbied washington to somehow stop india’s operation sindoor.

Kyle Tucker could “dramatically boost” New York Mets’ World Series push

Kyle Tucker has suddenly become a big name to watch in Major League Baseball free agency. On January 7, 2026, MLB insider Will Sammon reported that the New York Mets are closely watching Kyle Tucker. The team believes adding him could “dramatically boost” their World Series hopes after missing the playoffs in 2025.The New York Mets were expected to spend heavily this winter. So far, they have focused mostly on pitching and added infielder Jorge Polanco. But now, people inside the league say the Mets could shift gears fast if Kyle Tucker becomes available at the right price.Kyle Tucker is one of the most respected outfielders in baseball. He is a four-time All-Star and known for his power, calm hitting style, and strong arm.According to Will Sammon, writing on January 7, 2026, the New York Mets already like their roster. But they believe Kyle Tucker could take it to another level.“Unlike a vocal segment of the New York Mets’ fan base, club officials view their roster as strong,” Sammon wrote. “Reeling in a star like free-agent outfielder Kyle Tucker, however, would dramatically boost the team’s World Series odds.”This interest comes after a painful 2025 season in New York. The Mets were in playoff position late in the year but collapsed in the second half and missed the postseason.That ending pushed the front office to look for a true difference-maker. The Mets are not alone. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who have won the last two World Series, are also linked to Kyle Tucker.The Toronto Blue Jays are in the mix as well. Sammon reported that the Mets prefer a shorter contract with a very high yearly salary, while the Blue Jays are open to offering more years.He added that the Dodgers “loom as a contender,” given their history of landing stars. Around the league, some executives believe Kyle Tucker could command a deal near $400 million, depending on length and structure.While Kyle Tucker draws attention, Cody Bellinger is also shaping the outfield market. This week in New York, multiple reports said the New York Yankees sent Cody Bellinger a second contract offer.The team is still looking to strengthen its lineup after falling short of a championship run. Jomboy Media’s Chris Rose spoke about the situation and believes Cody Bellinger and his agent, Scott Boras, are focused on a long-term deal.“I think they’re chasing years,” Rose said. He added that a five-year deal worth around $30 million per season would not surprise him.Cody Bellinger has rebuilt his value with steady hitting and strong defense. The Yankees see him as a fit for both the outfield and first base, giving them flexibility.Talks are ongoing, and no final decision has been made. For now, both Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger remain free agents.But as January moves forward, teams in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto are watching closely.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Kyle tucker is a four-time all-star and known for his power, calm hitting style, and strong arm.

Candace Owens Targets Macrons Again: 'Brigitte Puts On A Fake Wig, Lipstick And Declares War On...'

Candace Owens explains why she believes Ben Shapiro and The Daily Wire keep following her career





Candace Owens is again speaking out against her former workplace, The Daily Wire, and its co-founder Ben Shapiro. On January 8, 2026, Owens posted on X and accused the company of using clips from her old podcast to publicly target her. She said Ben Shapiro legally owns the show, but she believes the clips are now being used in a hostile way. Candace Owens wrote that the reused clips show her “defending myself against their repeated attacks against me over the last two years.” She added a clear message to her followers, saying, “This is real life. The Daily Wire is using my old podcast to attack me.”This post came just days after Owens again talked about her fallout with the company on her own podcast. She said the situation feels ongoing, not finished, even though she was fired nearly two years ago. Candace Owens was officially fired from The Daily Wire in March 2024 after months of public tension. Since then, she says she expected a clean break. Instead, she believes her former employer continues to follow her work and resurface old content linked to her name.On the January 6, 2026 episode of her podcast, Candace Owens shared new details about what she noticed online.She said listeners told her that her old Daily Wire YouTube channel had suddenly reappeared after being private for a long time. Along with that, a trailer filmed in 2021 was posted again.Candace Owens said similar things happened on Instagram, where an old promotional video from her early days at the company was reposted. She made it clear that she does not believe these moves were accidental.During the episode, Owens said being fired should mean both sides move on. She claimed that did not happen. Instead, she said her former employer continued to watch her career, affect speaking events, and apply pressure behind the scenes.Candace Owens described the situation in personal terms. She said, “I truly am not trying to be dramatic here. It felt like a crazy ex-stalker. Like if I cannot have you, nobody can have you.”She also said she believes the old clips are connected to a new show she feels is meant to mock her, though she did not present independent proof of that claim.The Daily Wire has not publicly responded to Owens’ January 8 post as of press time.Candace Owens joined The Daily Wire in 2021 and became one of its most visible hosts. According to CNN reporting dated March 22, 2024, her firing followed backlash over comments she made about Israel after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. Ben Shapiro called those remarks “absolutely disgraceful.”In later months, Candace Owens said being fired brought her more attention than ever. By November 2025, reports noted her podcast had become the number one show globally.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises New Questions About Charlie Kirk After Revealing A Never Before Seen Image With No Visible Blood","Candace owens accuses ben shapiro of using her old podcast to publicly attack her after daily wire fallout.

Candace Owens’ claims about Charlie Kirk and the alleged shooting image







Candace Owens recently made strong claims about Charlie Kirk , but there is one very important thing readers need to know first. There is no verified or official record that Charlie Kirk was assassinated or shot. Still, Candace Owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo and talked about it during an episode of her show. Her comments quickly spread online and started new debates.According to Candace Owens, the image showed Charlie Kirk from behind at the moment she claims he was shot. She said there was no blood and no exit wound visible in the photo. This claim surprised many people and raised questions on social media. However, no police department, hospital, or university has confirmed such a shooting. Charlie Kirk has also appeared publicly after the time Candace Owens referred to.Candace Owens used this photo while explaining why she said she does not trust Terryl Farnsworth and Tyler Bowyer. Her words caught attention fast, but many people also questioned the accuracy of her statements.While speaking on her show, Candace Owens said the photo showed Charlie Kirk from behind with no visible blood after the alleged shooting.Pointing to the image, she said the only blood seen was on his hand.Candace Owens said, “This doesn’t make sense to me. It doesn’t make sense to the narrative. Doesn’t make sense to anybody that knows anything about guns. Charlie was in pretty good shape except for where he had the wound on his neck that we all saw.”She also mentioned a viral video that she claimed showed the moment Charlie Kirk was shot. That video was shared many times on social media, but there is no verified source confirming it shows a real shooting.During episode 242 of her YouTube channel, Candace Owens spoke about a man named Tyler Robinson, who she claimed was wrongly blamed. She said Tyler Robinson drove from Orem to Panguitch, Utah, and stopped at Cowboys Smokehouse on North Main Street. According to her observation, an employee recognized him and contacted authorities.Candace Owens questioned why someone would plan an attack but then use a credit card at a public place. She also claimed federal pressure was placed on Utah authorities. However, there are no official police statements or court records supporting these claims.Since then, Candace Owens has continued to speak about this topic, sharing different theories. Some people support her views, while others strongly criticize them. Even members of Charlie Kirk’s family have publicly asked her to stop spreading these claims.Also Read: “It’s So Stupid It Hurts”: Candace Owens Blasts CIA Narrative After Charlie Kirk Assassination Sparks Fresh Public Outrage","Candace owens shared what she said was a never-before-seen photo and talked about it during an episode of her show.

Asmongold’s comments about the Minneapolis shooting fuels controversy







Twitch streamer Zack “Asmongold” has once again made headlines after he shared his opinions about the deadly shooting in Minneapolis. Reports claimed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a driver during an immigration raid. The incident quickly became a major topic online.According to the Associated Press, the victim was a 37-year-old woman who was shot in the head in front of a family member. On the same day, a short clip from Asmongold’s livestream began circulating on X. In the video, the Texas-based streamer openly defended the officer’s actions. His comments drew heavy criticism, making the situation even more explosive.In the viral clip, Asmongold argued that people calling the incident a murder were wrong. He suggested that the woman should not have been near the officer’s vehicle. He claimed critics would never change their views and said trying to explain the situation was pointless. According to him, authorities should respond with overwhelming force rather than sympathy. He added that after using force, officers should show dominance instead of trying to justify themselves. He insisted that people who oppose such actions are not interested in understanding another point of view.When viewers asked why police did not shoot the car’s tires, Asmongold strongly rejected the idea. He said damaging the tires could make the vehicle dangerous and harm innocent bystanders. He argued that if someone ignores police orders and tries to escape, officers should respond directly. His tone remained aggressive, which further fueled backlash.The controversy grew after political commentator Steven “Destiny” weighed in. Destiny claimed that creators like Asmongold were celebrating the shooting. Asmongold responded on social media by saying the woman was told to exit the car, but instead reversed and tried to run over an officer. He stated that following police instructions is critical and said this context was being ignored. He added that another camera angle made the situation clearer.Tesla CEO Elon Musk also entered the discussion. He backed Asmongold’s stance by saying that when law enforcement orders someone to stop, they must comply. Musk added that using a vehicle as a weapon against an officer justifies self-defense.The incident continues to divide opinions online. While some support Asmongold’s view, many others believe his comments crossed a line.Also Read: Why Zack “Asmongold” comments about white liberal women triggered massive backlash?

Stephen A. Smith questions ICE shooting of Renee Nicole Good while criticizing Kristi Noem’s explanation

Stephen A. Smith is speaking out after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. The longtime ESPN commentator said the ICE agent who fired the shot was likely legally justified, but he also made it clear that the moment raised deep moral questions. Smith said the agent did not have to kill her and could have shot the tires instead. The shooting happened in Minneapolis on Tuesday, January 7. Federal investigators later said the agent acted in self-defense. They claimed Renee Nicole Good tried to hit an ICE agent with her car. That explanation has not ended the debate.On his show, Smith said viewers should not expect charges against the agent. Still, he asked Americans to think about what kind of country they want to live in. His words added fuel to a national conversation already filled with anger, grief, and fear.As details came out, Renee Good’s family also spoke. Her mother described her as kind, loving, and deeply caring. With emotions running high, the case now sits at the center of a larger talk about law enforcement, judgment, and human life.Stephen A. Smith did not hold back when talking about the Minneapolis shooting. From a legal view, he said the agent will likely face no charges.He told viewers, “From a lawful perspective, as it pertains to a law enforcement official, don’t expect him to be prosecuted. He was completely justified.”But Smith quickly shifted his tone. He said being legal does not always mean being right. Smith questioned why deadly force was used when other options may have been possible. He said, “From a humanitarian perspective, however, why did you have to do that? If you could move out of the way, that means you could have shot the tires.”Smith explained his point further. He said Renee Good was not speeding toward the agent. “She wasn’t driving down the road coming at you 90 miles an hour. She was parked in the middle of the street,” he added.Smith also said he did not agree with how DHS Secretary Kristi Noem explained the shooting. He warned that Americans may soon need to ask hard questions about the country they are living in.Renee Nicole Good was 37 years old and lived in Minneapolis. Federal investigators said the shooting was self-defense. They claimed she tried to run over an agent before she was shot.After her name was released, Star Tribune spoke with her mother, Donna Ganger. She said Renee lived with her partner in the Twin Cities. Ganger was told about her daughter’s death on Wednesday, January 8.Ganger also pushed back on claims about protests. She said Renee was not part of any ICE protest. She told the paper, “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known. She was extremely compassionate. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”Renee was once married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr., who died in 2023. They shared one child, now six years old. Family members also said Renee had two other children who live with extended family.Also Read: “Darwinism In Full Effect”: Sean Strickland’s Reaction To The ICE Agent's Fatal Shooting Of Renee Nicole Good Ignites Outrage",Stephen a. smith defends ice agent in renee good shooting but questions the choice to use deadly force.
