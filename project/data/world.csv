The defence ministry has begun examining a proposal from the Indian Air Force (IAF) to procure 114 ""Made in India"" Rafale fighter jets in collaboration with French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and Indian aerospace firms.Estimated to be worth over Rs 2 lakh crore, with more than 60 percent indigenous content, the mega deal is expected to be taken up by the Defence Procurement Board, headed by the Defence Secretary, in the coming weeks, officials told ANI.Once cleared, the proposal will move to the Defence Acquisition Council for final approval.The new acquisition would take the number of Rafales in India’s arsenal to 176, adding to the 36 already inducted by the IAF and 36 ordered for the Indian Navy under separate government-to-government agreements.Officials noted that the move follows the Rafale’s strong performance during Operation Sindoor, where the aircraft reportedly outclassed Chinese PL-15 air-to-air missiles using its advanced Spectra electronic warfare suite. The Indian-built jets are expected to feature longer-range air-to-ground missiles than the Scalp used in Pakistan strikes.Dassault plans to establish a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for Rafale’s M-88 engines in Hyderabad, complementing an existing maintenance firm in India.Indian partners such as Tata are likely to be involved in the production.The IAF sees the deal as crucial to bolstering its force structure alongside Su-30 MKIs, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1A, of which 180 have already been ordered, and the indigenous fifth-generation fighter jet planned for induction beyond 2035.","The defence ministry has begun examining a proposal from the indian air force to procure 114 ""made in india"" rafale fighter jets.

Suspense Grows in Nepal PM Race: Four Names, One Decision, A Nation on Edge

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh kumar singh said that operation sindoor served as a “reality check’ for india’s armed forces.

Police Form SIT To Probe Kolkata Rape Case After Victim's Father Denies Assault

LONDON: A British-born Sikh woman in her 20s was sexually assaulted, raped and beaten in a racially motivated attack on Tuesday in Oldbury, near Birmingham, by two white men.West Midlands police confirmed to TOI they are investigating the rape which the woman claims happened between 8 am and 8.30 am, and they are treating it as a racially aggravated attack.“The woman has told us that a racist remark was made to her during the attack,” a police spokesperson said.According to Sikh Federation (UK), during the attack the rapists shouted at her: “You don’t belong in this country, get out.”A West Midlands Police spokesperson said they were called just before 8.30 am on Sept 9 after the woman reported being attacked in the area around Tame Road.The two attackers are described as being white. One had a shaved head, heavy build, and was wearing a dark sweatshirt and gloves. The second was wearing a grey zipped top.MP Gurinder Singh Josan, whose constituency office is just minutes away from where the rape happened, said: “This is a truly horrific attack and my thoughts are with the victim. I am reassured Sandwell police are doing everything they possibly can to find the perpetrators. The incident is being treated as a hate crime. The police are working extremely sympathetically with the victim, who has been traumatised.”Sikh Youth UK has met and is supporting the victim and her family.Chief Superintendent Kim Madill, of Sandwell police, said: “We are working really hard to identify those responsible, with CCTV, forensic and other enquiries well under way. We fully understand the anger and worry that this has caused. Incidents like this are incredibly rare, but people can expect to see extra patrols.”The rape follows the recent unprovoked attack on two British Sikh taxi drivers, Satnam Singh (64) and Jasbir Sangha (72), on Aug 15 outside Wolverhampton station during which Singh’s turban was ripped off. British Transport Police are treating that as a racially aggravated assault.

The announcement followed PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam in Varanasi.The 2 countries signed several other agreements aimed at helping Mauritius improve infrastructure and healthcare, augment maritime security and enhance defence preparedness, while allowing India to expand its footprint in the Indian Ocean. The projects announced under the package, along with budgetary assistance of $ 25 million, are together worth $ 680 million.The PM said both sides will work towards enabling trade in local currencies. Modi also said the projects, based on both grant and grant-cum-line of credit basis, are designed to support Mauritius’ needs and priorities, adding India will advance projects such as the Chagos Marine Protected Area, ATC Tower at the international airport and the expansion of highways and ring roads.“This package is not assistance. It is an investment in our shared future,” said Modi in his media remarks after the meeting, adding Mauritius was not a partner but family for India.The PM also announced signing of an agreement for cooperation in the field of hydrography, saying that, over the next 5 years, the 2 countries will work together on joint surveys, navigation charts, and hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ.Mauritius EEZ has expanded significantly after its recent treaty with the UK established its sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India was Mauritius’ preferred partner in the latter’s pursuit of protecting and securing its interests in the region. “It has many more responsibilities now. It needs maritime resources, and to be able to fully develop and exploit those resources, it will need assistance, and India is a preferred partner in providing that assistance,” said Misri.India had strongly backed the transfer of Chagos sovereignty to Mauritius through the treaty that also allowed the UK to retain control of the Diego Garcia island from where the UK and US operate a vital military base. In his remarks after the meeting, Ramgoolam appreciated India’s support.“We want to visit the Chagos Islands, including Diego Garcia, to plant our flag. The British offered us a vessel, but we said we preferred one from India because, symbolically, it would be more meaningful,"" said Ramgoolam.Modi also said in his statement that a free, open, secure, stable, and prosperous Indian Ocean is a shared priority. “In this context, India remains fully committed to strengthening the security of Mauritius’s EEZ and enhancing its maritime capacity,” said the PM, adding India has always stood as the first responder and a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region. The PM highlighted the refitting of the Mauritius Coast Guard ship that is being undertaken in India and also training of its officers here.The PM congratulated Ramgoolam for the Chagos Agreement, calling it a historic milestone for Mauritius’ sovereignty. “India has always supported decolonization, and the full recognition of Mauritius’ sovereignty. India has always stood firmly with Mauritius in this journey,” he said, adding that Mauritius was a key part of India’s Neighbourhood First policy and Vision MAHASAGAR. The 2 countries had upgraded relations to an enhanced strategic partnership when Modi visited Mauritius in March this year.",India announces a special economic package for mauritius.

Durga Prasad Subedi, the husband, was one of three men who commandeered a Royal Nepal Airlines de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in 1973 that had Bollywood star Mala Sinha among the passengers.Speaking fondly of Karki (73), Prof Dipak Malik, a retired BHU professor and former director of Gandhian Institute of Studies, said: ""We have had a cordial relationship with her since her days in BHU... We are happy Nepal is going to get a neutral and honest person to lead the country.""""I do not forget to meet her whenever I go to Nepal,"" he added, having last visited her in Nov 2024. Prof Malik highlighted Karki's strong reputation for integrity, zero tolerance for corruption, and political neutrality, and landmark rulings against corrupt officials that earned her widespread respect.Prof Malik said Karki met her husband, a Nepali Congress youth leader who led the June 10, 1973 hijacking during the protests against the Panchayat regime of King Mahendra, while studying at BHU.The other two hijackers were Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai. The operation was orchestrated to fund rebellion against the monarchy. Among the conspirators were future Nepal PMs Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala.According to reports, the three hijackers directed the pilot to land in Forbesganj, a border town in Bihar near Nepal's Biratnagar. The hijackers got off the plane there and fled into the jungle with a large amount of cash which, according to reports, belonged to a Nepalese bank and was being transported on the flight to Kathmandu.Subedi went into hiding in Varanasi after the incident and was ultimately arrested after Emergency was imposed in India in 1975. He remained in jail for two years before being handed over to Nepalese authorities.The other hijackers were also convicted and jailed but released after the Emergency was lifted in India.In a recent interview to CNN-News18, Karki called herself a ""friend of India"", attributing this bond to her time at BHU. ""My years at BHU left a lasting impression,"" she said, remembering her teachers and friends. Karki emphasised the long-standing relationship between India and Nepal, highlighting India's support and goodwill towards Nepal. Talking about the Indian leadership, she said she has ""a good impression of Modi-ji"".Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, Karki obtained a BA from Mahendra Morang Campus in 1972, followed by an MA from BHU. She obtained a law degree from Nepal's Tribhuvan University in 1978 and began her legal career in 1979, becoming a senior advocate in 2007 and a Supreme Court judge in 2010.

Trump’s efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad’s progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on September 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. “The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,” said a source, on condition of anonymity.It’s important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the “perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay” was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on September 26. It will address, according to official sources,emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platformand metaverse.“It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguardsagainst misuse by terrorists,” said an official.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program.While basic Quad cooperation continues, bilateral defence collaboration with the US seems to have escaped unscathed from the downturn in India-US ties. Three AH-64E Apache attack helicopters were delivered to the Indian Army in Julyand the US has committed to delivering 3 more in November. General Electric (GE) 404 engine delivery for India’s Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme is also underway, according to sources. The US and India will carry out their bilateral Cope air exercise in November. It will be preceded by the Malabar naval exercise among the navies of India, US, Japan and Australia.",India has taken note of us ambassador-designate sergio gor’s remarks during his confirmation hearing that president donald trump remains committed to a meeting of quad leaders.

Akal Takht's Gargajj shares stage with Dhadrianwala first time after lifting ban on latter for 'misinterpreting Gurbani',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/akal-takhts-gargajj-shares-stage-with-dhadrianwala-first-time-after-lifting-ban-on-latter-for-misinterpreting-gurbani/articleshow/123857140.cms,"Gargajj and Dhadrianwala shares stage in Kurukshetra

KURUKSHETRA: The officiating Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Kuldip Singh Gargajj was seen sharing stage for the first time with Sikh preacher Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwala, after the completion of the latter’s religious atonement and lifting of ban upon him by Akal Takht, during a religious congregation organised by Haryana Sikh community members at Pipli in Kurukshetra district on Friday.Akal Takht lifted the ban on Dhadrianwala in May 2025 after he formally apologized for his controversial statements, which had led to a ban order from the Akal Takht in 2020. Dhadrianwala appeared before the Akal Takht, sought forgiveness, and was permitted to resume religious congregations and preaching, provided he adhered to Sikh principles and the Panthic Code of Conduct.Subsequently, Dhadrianwala, has now started to participate and conduct religious preaching in public Sikh congregations across the region on demand of the community. Akal Takht Jathedar also sharing stage with him marks a significant shift in the field of Sikh religious preaching at a time when the community feels it has several challenges especially in their home states of Punjab and Haryana housing the highest number of Sikh population in the country. Dhadrianwala gave three days of time to the community members in Kurukshetra.Dhadrianwala while speaking at the event expressed happiness over the presence of Jathedar Gargajj and assured that the code of conduct of Akal Takht Sahib will be followed in letter and spirit during his events.“Today, hypocrisy, falsehood are prevented in the society and people are in pain, which can be eased and cured with the teachings of Guru Granth Sahib. There is great need for equality in the society, uplift the so-called downtrodden communities, shun the hatred among each other and the teachings and philosophy of Sikh Gurus can do this. People of the world are demanding that the Sikh Gurus’ philosophy reach them and it is our responsibility to do so”, said Gargajj.Jathedar Gargajj termed Harjit Singh Rasulpur as Behrupia (person of different disguises) for allegedly doing “false propaganda” that during the flood relief efforts being conducted by different Sikh organisations in Punjab, discrimination is being done with poor people and the relief is reaching to people of higher classes and not to the needy. He said that even people of Punjab, Haryana and Western and Terai region of Uttar Pradesh have reached Punjab with relief material signifying the strong brotherhood among the community here. He cautioned the congregation to beware of persons like Rasulpur, who allegedly try to spread hatred in the society.Gargajj said, “I felt happy when Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale paid obeisance before the Akal Takht. Why shall we stop our preachers? In Punjab’s Majha region, efforts are being made to misdirect the community to other paths on the pretext of falsehood, hypocrisy and greed by adopting fraudulent ways. But we need to stop this with unity and by having faith in our Guru.”Prominent Sikh preacher Bhai Sahib Singh Markanda was also present in the event.","Gargajj and dhadrianwala shares stage in kurukshetra district on friday.

Tavia Hunt and Randi Mahomes react to the tragedy

“As a society, we must be reminded that human life is sacred and never disposable.

We must learn again to disagree with words, not weapons. That is exactly what Charlie Kirk modeled — he met opposition with dialogue, not violence, and proved that conviction and civility can walk hand in hand. Evil does not have the final word. Jesus does. And because of Him, Charlie’s voice still echoes — calling us to live with conviction, courage, and hope.

Well done good and faithful servant.”
