Pak Army Hit By Ammunition Shortage; Artillery Stockpile Near Zero Amid War Fear | India Ready!

NEW DELHI: The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan had asked for an emergency meeting on the issue. Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, which is being led by Greece for the month of May.Pakistan ""requested closed consultations"" over the growing tensions, and the Greek Presidency scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon.Pakistan said on Sunday that it will ""inform"" the UNSC about what it called India's ""aggressive actions"".""Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India's aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,"" the Pakistan's foreign office said.""Pakistan will specifically highlight India's illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,"" it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi's actions are jeopardising ""peace and security"" in the region.The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power: China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US. The ten non-permanent members are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia.Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. The Permanent Representative of Greece to the UN and the Security Council president for May, Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, said last week that a meeting should take place if there is a request.""Then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit of tension,"" Sekeris said.""We are in close contact...but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing,"" he added.News agency PTI reported that when it asked Sekeris about India being affected by cross-border terrorism from Pakistan, which is now on the Council, and the need to deal with terrorism, he said, ""It’s an issue which is very pertinent.""He added, ""As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did"" on the ""heinous terrorist attack"" in Pahalgam, in which civilians were killed.Sekeris further said, ""We express our condolences to the government of India, Nepal and the families of victims. This is a position of principle. We condemn terrorism in all its forms, everywhere it is happening. On the other hand, we are concerned about this tension which is mounting in the region. Two very big countries. Of course, India is far more bigger"" than Pakistan.After the Pahalgam attack in which 26 civilians died, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke with all Council members except China and Pakistan, as per a report by the news agency PTI.He told them that ""its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice.""Jaishankar had a ""good conversation"" with Greek foreign minister George Gerapetritis and ""discussed the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""India welcomed Greece’s strong stand against cross-border terrorism. Jaishankar said their ""Strategic Partnership reflects the depth of our ties.""He also spoke with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the foreign ministers of Russia, the US, the UK, France, South Korea, Denmark, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Guyana, Slovenia, Somalia, and Panama.Last Friday, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said at a press conference that Pakistan has the right to ask for a meeting when it feels it is needed.""We see that all of this that is happening is in the context, in the backdrop of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,"" Ahmad said.""Here it is evident that there was an incident but now what has evolved in terms of the situation which is a real threat to regional and international peace and security, and we believe that the Security Council, in fact, has the mandate, and it would be very legitimate for any member of the Council, including Pakistan, to request a meeting, a discussion of the Security Council, to consider this very serious situation that has evolved. We have discussed that with the Council members. We have discussed that with the in fact, the previous, last month’s presidency, and this month’s presidency. We are observing the situation very closely, and we have the right to convene a meeting when we feel appropriate,"" he added.Ahmad also met UN Secretary General Guterres last week and gave him a briefing about the situation in the region.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 24 said that the people behind the Pahalgam terror attack and those supporting them will be punished. In a meeting on April 29 with senior defence officials, Modi said that the armed forces have ""complete operational freedom"" to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported, quoting government sources.","The un security council (unsc) will hold closed consultations on monday about the situation between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The IAF chief Sunday briefed PM Modi on the operational readiness of his force, which has been undertaking long-range fighter sorties along the western frontier and keeping its air defence network on high alert.With India keeping all military options open for limited punitive strikes against Pakistan, Modi reviewed the situation with Air Chief Marshal A P Singh .The meeting came a day after Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi had similarly briefed the PM. tnnPM Modi had told the country's military brass on April 29 that they had ""complete operational freedom"" to decide on the ""mode, targets and timing"" of the country's response to terrorism.

The IAF, on its part, has been undertaking regular combat air patrols (CAPs) amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, while it has also increased the number of operational readiness platforms (ORPs) at airbases on the western front.An ORP usually includes two to three fully-armed fighters being kept ready round-the-clock in blast pens adjoining the runway at an airbase for immediate take-off whenever an alarm is sounded.The IAF, incidentally, did not have the 4.5-generation Rafales when it had conducted the aerial strike against the JeM terror facility at Balakot in Pakistan in Feb 2019.The omni-role Rafales are armed with long-range weapons like the over 300-km range 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles and the top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which have a strike range of 120 to 150 km to take on enemy jets.","Iaf on alert, rafales ready for swift strike as tensions soar with pakistan.

A Conversation with Rahul Gandhi

'Ridiculed not just in India, but around the world': BJP

What happened in 1984?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , during his recent visit to the United States, faced pointed questions from a Sikh student regarding his party's historical relationship with the Sikh community , particularly concerning the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. While the exchange occurred on April 21, the video only emerged on May 3.The student questioned Rahul Gandhi's recent statements suggesting that Sikhs might face restrictions on wearing religious symbols like the kara and turban under the current BJP government. The student highlighted what he saw as a contradiction in Gandhi's stance on fearless politics, given the Congress party 's own complicated history with Sikh rights.“You talked about how politics should be fearless. There should be nothing to be afraid of, right? But we don’t just want to wear karas. We don’t just want to tie our turbans. We want freedom of expression, which under the Congress party in the past has not been allowed,” the student asserted.The student further referred to the sentencing of former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar, saying the party had failed to reconcile with the Sikh community after the 1984 violence. A Delhi court sentenced Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment on February 25 for leading a mob that killed two Sikhs in Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar during the 1984 riots .Gandhi responded by acknowledging his party's past mistakes, though noting they occurred before his time in politics.""A lot of those mistakes happened when I was not there. But I'm more than happy to take responsibility for everything that the Congress party has ever done wrong in its history,"" he stated. He also spoke about his personal connection with the Sikh community, mentioning his visits to the Golden Temple and publicly condemning the events of the 1980s.""I have publicly stated that what happened in the 80s was wrong. I have been to the Golden Temple multiple times. I have an extremely good relationship with the Sikh community in India and a loving relationship with them,"" the former Congress president said.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya shared a clip from the video, saying it was telling that Rahul Gandhi was being “mocked not just in India, but globally.” He added that the student had directly reminded Gandhi of the “unfounded fear-mongering” he had done about Sikh identity under BJP rule.""You haven’t reconciled with the Sikhs,” a young man tells Rahul Gandhi to his face, reminding him of the unfounded fear-mongering he engaged in during his last visit to the US. It is quite unprecedented that Rahul Gandhi is now being ridiculed not just in India, but around the world,"" he wrote. Operation Blue Star was launched in June 1984. Ordered by the government, it aimed to flush out armed Sikh militants led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The operation resulted in heavy casualties and significant damage to the gurdwara.Bhindranwale was killed during the assault. In a retaliatory act, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, sparking widespread anti-Sikh riots that killed thousands.",Congress mp rahul gandhi faced pointed questions from a sikh student regarding his party's historical relationship with the sikh community.

FEROZEPUR: A 30-minute blackout drill from 9pm Sunday in Punjab's Ferozepur Cantonment , along the India-Pakistan border , harked back to the 1971 War when it had become routine to order lights off to reduce visibility for enemy aircraft.Ferozepur Cantonment Board had intimated residents in advance about the power cut as part of a safety preparedness exercise. As the cantonment area plunged into darkness, the only light was from headlamps of vehicles being stopped for frisking at multiple checkpoints on the highway.Residents were mostly cooped up in their homes, keeping even personal generators and inverters switched off for the entire duration of the drill.Hooters pierced the night air continuously, heightening the feeling of an emergency despite everyone knowing that it was a mock exercise.The cantonment board's official statement described the temporary blackout as being part of ""routine safety preparedness"" involving the public. ""This mock drill is being conducted in the interest of public safety, and we greatly appreciate the cooperation and understanding of all residents,"" the statement said, assuring the residents that normal power supply would resume immediately after the drill ended at 9.30pm.Sure enough, lights came on at the designated time.

It’s dangerous,” Michelle Obama said. “As the first black potential president, we knew there would be death threats … how would we afford it? Because it’s expensive to live in the White House, as many people don’t know.”“I mean, much is not covered,” she added. “You’re paying for every food, every bit of food that you eat, you know, you’re not paying for housing and the staff in it … but everything, even travel, if you’re not traveling with the president, if you’re kids are coming on a Bright Star, which is the first lady’s plane, we had to pay for their travel to be on the plane.”“It is an expensive proposition, and you’re running for two years and not earning an income, so all of that was in my mind, um, how would we manage this.""People called out the entitlement and raised questions over how the net worth of the Obamas ballooned if they were struggling so much.

A former FBI official on MSNBC's Morning Joe program commented that FBI director Kash Patel, despite the fear that was spread ahead of his confirmation that he would dismantle the system if he became the FBI director, has surprisingly taken a backseat.Former FBI counter-intelligence official Frank Figliuzzi said Kash Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office, but people are not complaining because they think things would have been bad, had he been trying to run them, given his experience or the lack of it.""Yeah well, reportedly, he's been visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building,"" Figliuzzi replied. ""And there are reports that daily briefings to him have been changed from every day to maybe twice weekly. """"So this is both a blessing and a curse, because if you, if he's, really trying to run things without his experience, without any experience level, things could be bad.

Donald Trump finally names his possible successors. It's not JD Vance alone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-finally-names-his-possible-successors-its-not-jd-vance-alone/articleshow/120876049.cms,"Donald Trump once refused to endorse JD Vance as his successor.

Donald Trump finally doused the speculations of Trump 2028 after his organization launched merchandise, and clarified in NBC's Meet the Press that he would leave the White House at the end of his second term. As successors, he named Vice President JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio and said they are doing great.Weeks ago, he refused to endorse JD Vance for 2028 and doubled down that he gets a lot of requests from his party members to run again in 2028 - which is not permissible by the Constitution, but he said there are many loopholes that would allow him to run for a third time. He even said that he was not joking when he spoke about running for a third time.In an exclusive interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said, ""I’ll be an eight-year president, I’ll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important.”The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.” Amending the Constitution to abolish that limit would be extremely difficult, requiring the support of either two-thirds of both the House and Senate or two-thirds of state legislatures. Another method came into discussion that Donald Trump would be running for the vice president along with JD Vance as the president. If they win, the president could resign to make way for the vice president to take over.“I think [Vance’s] a fantastic, brilliant guy,” he said. “Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great. I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage.”“But I think the other people would all stay in unbelievably high positions,” he added. “But you know, it could be that he’d be challenged by somebody.

Saquon Barkley’s golf day with Donald Trump triggers mixed reactions

Fiancée Anna Congdon’s old tweets resurface and stir more backlash

Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former President Donald Trump and the resurfacing of old, offensive tweets by his fiancée, Anna Congdon. The firestorm comes during what should have been a celebratory moment: the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory visit to the White House.Just days before the team’s scheduled visit to the White House, Saquon Barkley joined Donald Trump for a round of golf at the former president’s Bedminster, N.J. club. Barkley even flew to Washington aboard Air Force One with Trump, with cameras capturing them stepping off Marine One together. Trump joked, “I wanted to race him, but I decided not to do it,” calling the Pro Bowl athlete “a nice guy.”But the images sparked online outrage, especially given the political tension surrounding Trump. Critics accused Barkley of aligning himself with a divisive figure right before a non-partisan team event.Barkley responded directly on social media, writing: “Get out of my mentions with all this politics. Some people are really upset ’cause I played golf and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT… Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand.” He also pointed out that he had previously golfed with Barack Obama, emphasizing his stance on respecting the presidency, not the politics.While Barkley was defending his Trump appearance, his fiancée, Anna Congdon, came under fire for a different reason. Social media users resurfaced tweets she made as a teenager in 2012 and 2013 that contained racial slurs and insensitive language, including casual use of the N-word. The tweets drew heavy criticism, especially since Congdon and Barkley have a biracial child.Though the posts were over a decade old, many questioned whether they reflected deeper views. Neither Congdon nor Barkley has commented on the matter publicly, but the timing of the leak — just ahead of the Super Bowl — raised suspicion about the motives behind it.The Eagles' visit to the White House was notable not just for Barkley's presence, but also for the absence of key players, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith. While the official explanation was “scheduling conflicts,” the silent boycott echoed past tensions with Trump-era politics.Also Read: “Turning sports into reality TV”: Kelly Stafford urges balance between public curiosity and privacy in Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s relationship Ultimately, Barkley’s actions and the resurfaced tweets have reignited debate over how athletes engage with politics and public figures — and whether personal gestures can ever truly be separated from public perception.",Philadelphia eagles star running back saquon barkley has found himself at the center of controversy following a high-profile weekend with former president donald trump.
