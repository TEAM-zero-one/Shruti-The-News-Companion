NEW DELHI: Indian Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.In an exclusive interview with ANI, he shared his thoughts on being multi-religious, citing his exposure to diverse faiths during his time in the 18th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir rifles .This regiment uniquely had a mosque, gurdwara, Durga Mata temple, and Mahakal temple all under one roof, fostering an environment of interfaith harmony.When asked about his recent visit to Mahakaleshwar Temple in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the Army chief said, ""I am multi-religious. I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham. And once I got the blessings there from my Maulvi, my Pandit, my Granthi, thereafter I started going to all the places,"" said the Army chief.General Dwivedi recalled how his father would tell him stories of freedom fighters and World War II heroes, inspiring him to join the army.In a candid revelation, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi shared the story of how his childhood experiences shaped his decision to join the Indian Army.One particular memory that stood out was when his uncle would bring home copies with photographs of soldiers. These images sparked a sense of curiosity and admiration in young Dwivedi. As he grew older, he began to explore various career options, considering medicine and engineering, just like his brothers.However, the allure of the Army ultimately won him over. General Dwivedi recalled how he initially wanted to become an intelligence officer, but after gaining more exposure, he decided to join the Army first and then explore opportunities in intelligence.""I remember my uncle when he used to ask him, So the copy which he used to bring used to have a soldier's photo. Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there. I wanted to become an intelligence officer if I can say that. But when I went to school and saw everything, then I said, okay, let me join the Army first, thereafter look at intelligence,"" the Army chief said.He also shared his experience of flying the LCA with air marshal AP Singh during Aero India 2025, praising Singh's leadership and straightforward qualities. He recalled that air marshal Singh was a standout individual even during their National Defence Academy (NDA) days, earning the respect and admiration of his peers.In a nostalgic reflection, Army chief general Upendra Dwivedi reminisced about his school days, when he and his peers would admire all three services - the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He shared that it was simply fate that led him to join the Army.""See, when we were in school, we used to look at all three services. We used to love all three, if I can say that. It just so happened that I came into the army. Let me tell you about AP first. As far as AP is concerned, from NDA days, he is a gold torch. And he is, everybody has a natural liking towards him. He is a man who can collect people together. He is a natural leader. And he takes ownership of a crowd. But he is a very straightforward man. So, I say in the lighter moment, he should have been in the infantry,"" said the Army chief.The Army chief highlighted Air Marshal Singh's ability to bring people together, his natural leadership skills, and his willingness to take ownership of responsibilities. General Dwivedi jokingly added that Air Marshal Singh's straightforward nature and team-bonding skills would have made him an excellent fit for the infantry.""He's so straightforward. And such a team-bonding man, he should have been infantry,"" he added.This lighthearted exchange offers a glimpse into the camaraderie and mutual respect shared between general Dwivedi and air marshal Singh, showcasing the strong bonds forged during their formative years at the NDA.The Army chief's comments offer a glimpse into his personal life and military career, highlighting the importance of respecting all religions and the value of teamwork and leadership.As the 30th chief of the Army staff, he brings a wealth of experience, having served in various roles, including Northern Army commander and director general of infantry.","Indian army chief general upendra dwivedi recently opened up about his multi-religious upbringing and illustrious military career.

BJP, Congress demand probe into 'external interference' in polls



NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","Us president donald trump asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to india for ""voter turnout"" he said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"" the bjp has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter.

Singh had accused Gandhi of misquoting the Army chief and indulging in ""irresponsible politics"" on matters of national security. Gen Dwivedi, on his part, said, ""I think the political answer has been given by the Raksha Mantri (Singh). But the thing which I learnt is that it's important that I must make an endeavour that the Army should not be involved in politics.""On the Pakistan front, the Army chief said the neighbour has been very clearly told that the entire J&K is ""an integral part of India"", with the reading down of Article 370 in Aug 2019. ""There is no compromise with this,"" he said, noting that the number of ""local people"" being recruited as terrorists in J&K has significantly gone down, people no longer have ""confusion"" over their identity and the theme of ensuring the move from ""terrorism to tourism"" was working well on the ground.""India has said very clearly that we will be assertive in our communication (to Pakistan). And if required, we can be aggressive also. So, if you force us, then we will be aggressive enough to communicate our intent,"" he said. Asked about last month's visit of the Pak Army-ISI delegation to Rangpur in Bangladesh, which is close to the Siliguri Corridor in Bengal, Dwivedi said, ""I had used the word epicentre of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it.."" The Army chief had earlier said India and Bangladesh consider each other ""strategically important"" neighbours and any kind of ""animosity"" between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is ""very strong"" and ""we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,"" he said.","India since 2014 has been ""assertive"" in its communication to pakistan, says army chief.

NEW DELHI: India and Qatar upgraded their ties to a strategic partnership as PM Narendra Modi held bilateral talks with the visiting Qatar Amir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, discussing ways to enhance cooperation in areas like trade, investment, energy and security. Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in India, as it announced Qatar Investment Authority will open an office in India.The leaders spoke about signing a bilateral Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and agreed to double the current $ 14 billion bilateral trade in the next 5 years. Apart from the establishment of strategic partnership, 6 other deals were signed including a revised agreement for avoidance of double taxation and another for financial and economic collaboration. They also agreed agreed to expedite negotiations for the India-Qatar Bilateral Investment Treaty.Qatar is the 5th GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) country with which India has signed a strategic partnership agreement, after UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait.Modi and Al-Thani discussed the West Asia situation, reiterating their respective positions on the Gaza situation and emphasising the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve conflicts. Qatar is a key player in Gaza ceasefire efforts and, as US President Donald Trump proposes a takeover of the Strip, its foreign ministry said Tuesday Palestinians will decide the future of Gaza. India has also reiterated its support for the 2-state solution after Trump announced his plan to relocate Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt.The leaders unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism and agreed to jointly combat the menace through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.“They agreed to enhance cooperation in information and intelligence sharing, developing and exchanging experiences, best practices and technologies, capacity building and to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement, anti-money laundering, drug-trafficking, Cybercrime and other transnational crimes,’’ said the joint statement. Modi and the Amir spoke about promoting cooperation in cybersecurity, including prevention of use of cyberspace for terrorism and radicalisation.The Qatari leader had last year pardoned 85 Indian prisoners, including the 8 Indian navy veterans who had been sentenced to death for military espionage. Modi had personally thanked Al-Thani for their release during his visit to Doha last year but one of the men, Purnendu Tiwari, remains in Qatar because of a financial fraud case against him. A travel ban is said to have been imposed on him.“Regarding the Navy official who is still over there, I would like to just say his matter remains sub judice in the local courts in Qata,’’ said MEA Secretary Arun Chatterjee, who handled overseas Indian affairs. The official added that the PM appreciated the work that Amir has done for the protection and welfare of Indian citizens. Qatar is home to 800,000 Indian nationals.The official said that while talks are underway for an India- GCC FTA, India and Qatar at the bilateral level will look at the possibility of having an FTA in the future.According to the joint statement, Qatar commended the steps taken by India in ensuring a conducive environment for Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Institutional Investment and expressed interest to explore investment opportunities in different sectors, including infrastructure, technology, manufacturing, food security and hospitality. “In this regard, the Qatar side announced a commitment to invest $ 10 billion in India,’ it said, adding Indian side also appreciated Qatar’s efforts in enhancing its investment environment and its initiatives to attract Foreign Direct Investment.“India also recognized Qatar’s growing role as a regional hub for goods and services, leveraging its strategic location, world-class infrastructure, and business-friendly policies,’’ said the statement.","Qatar committed to investing $ 10 billion in india, as it announced qatar investment authority will open an office in india.

UFC bossrecently shared a personal story about his connection to, a place where he spent cherished summers with his grandparents. Growing up in Connecticut, White developed a strong bond with the area, and it’s clear his affection for the place never faded. In a recent interview with the Bangor Daily News, White revealed that his love for the region led him to make the extraordinary investment as he bought the entire street where he grew up. Dana White who has a whopping $500 million fortune (per Forbes), bought his entire childhood street as he still shares an emotional connection to the place. “My time up there meant so much to me and I loved the place so much that I bought up the whole street that my grandmother and grandfather live on,” White said. He bought up multiple homes along Phillips Road to preserve the spirit of his childhood memories. It was not all, White later made a whopping donation, offering these houses to the Levant Fire Department for controlled burns as part of their training exercises.According to Lieutenant Wyatt Morrison of the Levant Fire Department, one of the homes was burned down about five years ago, while another had been burned nearly a decade earlier. Despite parting with some properties, White still owns a substantial amount of land in the area, including nine homes totaling 60 acres on Phillips Road and additional properties nearby. White further shared that he will continue to purchase more land, saying, “I continue to buy more and more property up there and I will until the day I die.”For White, these properties are more than just investments; they are a way for his children to experience the place. “I wanted my kids to experience the place and the people, and that’s why I invested so much in Maine,” White explained. His Fourth of July celebrations with family in Levant have become a tradition.Also Read: Conor McGregor names his dream bare-knuckle opponents Over the years, he has made significant contributions to the area, including a $100,000 donation to his alma mater, Hermon High School, in 2011 for athletic upgrades.

DOGE dividend is a proposal in which the taxpayers may get a refund check of $5,000 from the money that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency targets to save by its 2026 deadline. The proposal has been floated on X by James Fishback, the CEO of an investment firm and also an outside adviser to DOGE. Elon Musk reacted to the proposal and said he would check this proposal with President Donald Trump.Fishback gave a detailed calculation and showed that if DOGE meets its target and then gives 20 per cent of the savings to the 79 million tax-paying households, then it would amount to a $5,000 return per household. This is what Fishback called the 'DOGE dividend'.DOGE has a target of $2 trillion in savings and the Elon Musk-led department, as on Monday, already achieved $55 billion. DOGE is targeting government departments, frauds and government employees to cut corners for which it drew massive flak for it suggested the deletion of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) that provides funds to war-torn countries, the Department of Education and will put forth their further recommendations. President Trump praised the department and its ""smart"" work done by Elon Musk dismissing any scope of any conflict of interest.According to Fishback's proposal, taxpayers should be compensated as DOGE has been claiming that their hard-earned tax dollars were misused and abused by the former administration. This, the proposal says, would boost tax morale as the taxpayers would feel that they are receiving adequate value in exchange for their tax payments.DOGE dividend would incentivize many to re-enter the labor force in 2025 in order to be eligible for the DOGE dividend.Only tax-paying households should receive unlike any past stimulus checks and so it won't be inflationary, the proposal said. It will be more like a tax refund and should be financed exclusively via spending cuts. The rest of DOGE's target should go towards paying the national debt, the proposal said.","Doge dividend is a proposal in which the taxpayers may get a refund check of $5,000 from the money that elon musk's department of government efficiency targets to save by its 2026 deadline.

Delta crash-landing: Here's what we know



What Delta CEO said



Though no lives were lost, the crash-landing of a Delta flight at the Toronto Airport Monday sent shockwaves as the plane turned upside down with the passengers hanging like bats inside. Several social media posts went viral claiming that all of the pilots of that particular aircraft were women and Delta's DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) is to be blamed for the mishap that was averted. Videos of women pilots are also doing the rounds claiming that they were the pilots of the plane.However, there is no confirmation about the claims as Delta has not received any details about the pilots and not even any information about the gender of the pilots. All the photos doing the rounds are hence unverified.Social media posts claimed the Delta flight that crash-landed was operated by Endeavor Air which is a ""small airline obsessed with all-female unmanned flights"". Old posts from Endeavor Air's social media handle are being shared with malicious claims that the female pilots shown in these old posts were the pilots of the fateful plane.At least 18 people were injured when the plane with 80 people on board from Minneapolis turned upside down on the runway. It is not yet known what caused the horrific incident but poor weather is being seen as a reason. Airport CEO Deborah Flint praised the pilots for their response to the critical situation ensuring no lives were lost.When the plane neared the airport, air traffic controllers informed the pilots about 38mph wind gusts and within two minutes, the plane flipped. Fire erupted after the plane tumbled and the plane slammed into the runway. As the passengers were hanging upside down, the flight attendants helped them crawl out of the doors.Some social media posts claimed that the controllers said the pilot was a male.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the flight crew on the plane was experienced and trained for difficult conditions. However, the CEO did not identify the pilots. ""There is one level of safety at Delta. All these pilots train for these conditions. This is what we train for. We train for this continuously,"" the CEO said.",Viral posts claimed all pilots of the delta plane that crash-landed in toronto were females.

The Donald Trump administration on Wednesday (local time) asked Pentagon to cut down its budget by 8% annually or by $290 billion withing the next five years.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to draft deep budget reductions, according to The Washington Post, which cited a memo on the matter.The Pentagon’s 2025 budget stands at approximately $850 billion, with bipartisan agreement among lawmakers that such substantial spending is necessary to counter global threats, particularly from China and Russia. However, if the proposed cuts are fully implemented, the budget would shrink by tens of billions annually, reaching around $560 billion within five years.While specifics on where the reductions would fall remain unclear, a previousreport suggested that junior civilian employees—not uniformed military personnel—were the primary targets.The move follows a visit to the Pentagon by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency last week and is expected to face strong opposition from both the military and Congress.With the Pentagon facing potential budget cuts, the US defense spending—currently around 3.4% of GDP—would move even further from the five percent threshold some policymakers have advocated.The news sent shockwaves through the defense sector, causing stock fluctuations among major US contractors. Lockheed Martin saw a brief dip before recovering, while Northrop Grumman dropped nearly two percent.

New York governor Democrat Kathy Hochul has been a strong supporter of this pricing.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the public-private entity that provides public transportation services in the New York metro area, immediately sued the government in an effort to block its move.No date has been given for the end of the prgram, And ow that there have been legal challenges, it is not known when the congestion pricing will be revoked.",Congestion pricing imposes a special surcharge on commuters using their private car in some marked areas so that people take public transportation.
