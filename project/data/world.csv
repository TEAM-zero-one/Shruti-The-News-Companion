Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Also read:





: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the state department on to us embassies and consular offices worldwide.

United States President Donald Trump on Thursday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said he may travel to India next year as the two countries continue discussions on trade.Speaking to reporters at the White House after announcing a move to reduce the prices of weight loss drugs, Trump said his conversations with PM Modi were progressing smoothly. He also reiterated his personal rapport with the prime minister.""He (PM Modi) largely stopped buying from Russia. And he is a friend of mine, and we speak.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap



Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson



Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper megan thee stallion, from the airport.

Micah Parsons makes emotional pledge to the family of Marshawn Kneeland after the confirmed details of Kneeland’s death

Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland died Wednesday night at 24. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has taken over the NFL after police confirmed he died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after a pursuit on the Dallas North Tollway. Two days earlier, Marshawn Kneeland scored his first NFL touchdown. The timeline has left fans, teammates, and coaches stunned.The details are confirmed by police, dispatch audio, and team statements. Nothing about this is speculation. Everything about this is difficult. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health story now sits at the center of a larger conversation the NFL has spent years trying to address.DPS troopers tried to stop a vehicle around 10:30 p.m. on the Dallas North Tollway near Keller Springs. Video from NTTA showed the trooper chasing a speeding car. Investigators said the trooper lost visual contact. Minutes later, the same car, registered to Marshawn Kneeland, was found crashed off the Dallas Parkway near The Star.Initial reports said Marshawn Kneeland left the scene on foot. Officers began searching after receiving information that he had expressed suicidal thoughts. Plano police went to the apartment listed to the vehicle around 11 p.m.,found no one inside, returned at 11:40 p.m. after another welfare call, and again made no contact.Frisco police found Marshawn Kneeland at 1:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner confirmed the cause as suicide, according to Nick Harris of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.TMZ published police dispatch audio that directly referenced the Marshawn Kneeland mental health crisis. Operators relayed information from Marshawn Kneeland’s girlfriend and the NFL. She told police he was armed, had a history of mental struggles, and told officers he said he would “end it all.” Dispatchers said the NFL told Plano PD that Marshawn Kneeland had been texting his family goodbye.A cousin of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland has publicly questioned the circumstances surrounding his death. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation intensified after his family said the events of Wednesday night did not match the person they knew.His first cousin, Jasmin Kneeland, told the Daily Mail she does not believe he died by suicide and said she is struggling to accept the official account. “I truly think they killed him, I truly do,” she said. She questioned why he would run and then die by suicide in a portable toilet. “Marshawn is not a violent person. He is not a hot head. Something here is just not right. Something made him really scared and he ran.”How former coaches, teammates, fans, and the league responded to Marshawn Kneeland and why the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation has become unavoidableThe Dallas Cowboys released a statement:“It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.”Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni opened his press conference by saying, “The NFL is a brotherhood, you know, and so obviously that was on our mind this morning. And our thoughts and prayers go out to, you know, his family and the and the Dallas Cowboys.”FOX 4 spoke with former Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and former assistant defensive line coach Greg Ellis. Mike Zimmer said he could have named countless players he worried about before he ever imagined Marshawn Kneeland would be in crisis. Greg Ellis called Marshawn Kneeland a second son. He was watching on Monday as Marshawn Kneeland scored his touchdown off a blocked punt.Greg Ellis said walking back into the locker room next week, seeing Marshawn Kneeland’s locker, and feeling that missing presence will hit the team again. Both coaches pointed out how difficult the timing is because the Dallas Cowboys are spread out during the bye week.Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Sterling Shepard said, “It hurts your heart… this is the real-life stuff people go through.”San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, who lost his sister to suicide, wrote, “I wish you knew it was going to be OK… I wish you knew how bad we wanted you to stay.”Fans gathered at The Star, leaving candles, flowers, and handwritten signs. Some had met him after Monday Night Football and said the loss felt personal.Marshawn Kneeland’s agent, Jonathan Perzley of Sportstars, posted his own statement:“I am shattered to confirm that my client and dearest friend Marshawn Kneeland passed away last night.”He added, “I watched him fight his way from a hopeful kid at Western Michigan with a dream to being a respected professional for the Dallas Cowboys. Marshawn poured his heart into every snap, every practice, and every moment on the field.”The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation is not new inside the league. The NFL and NFLPA mandated in 2019 that every team must have a licensed behavioral health clinician. The Indianapolis Colts launched “Kicking The Stigma” in 2020. Former Philadelphia Eagles star Brian Dawkins spoke publicly about his own depression and suicidal thoughts during his Hall of Fame induction.Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott lost his brother Jace to suicide in 2020. Defensive tackle Solomon Thomas lost his sister Ella in 2018. Marshawn Kneeland’s death has reopened those wounds. The NFL has more resources than ever, but this tragedy shows gaps that still exist.No one is guessing. The facts are confirmed. The reaction is real. The grief is everywhere. And the Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation will not go away, because it cannot go away.Green Bay Packers linebacker Micah Parsons spoke for the first time on Friday about the death of Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Marshawn Kneeland. The Marshawn Kneeland mental health conversation continues to ripple across the league, and Parsons made it clear that his former teammate’s family will not face this alone.Parsons and Marshawn Kneeland played together last season in Dallas. He described Kneeland as someone who brought respect and ease into the locker room.“Marshawn’s a guy who loved his anime, loved his video games, like anybody else,” Parsons said. “To me, he always showed me nothing but respect from the moment he came into the locker room.”Parsons said the loss has hit him harder than he expected.“He respected me as a player. He respected me as a person, so I have nothing but high respect for him. If there’s anything his family needs, I’ll be the first person to help or offer anything I can. I just hope that he finds his peace and his family finds his peace in the situation.”As Parsons prepares for Monday Night Football against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 10, he said he is still processing the news.“I would say I was extremely shocked. I was extremely hurt by the news. Anyone I know, I don’t want to see anyone go this soon at this age. I don’t want anyone to go, but that’s kind of the reality.”Parsons ended by reflecting on how moments like this force players to confront their own fears, especially as parents.“I think the first key is accepting. I kind of accept it, but now I just gotta pray he finds his peace and what he was looking for. How he felt in that moment, you just really don’t know. For me, I have kids. How do I make sure my kids don’t end up in that similar situation?”","Dallas cowboys defensive end marshawn kneeland died at 24, prompting urgent questions about mental health support across the nfl.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?",Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





WASHINGTON: From the MAGA perspective, millionaires are fleeing Manhattan, cops are quitting NYPD en masse, and the Big Apple is rotting faster than strawberries on a summer day because New York City has fallen…to Communists, Islamists and immigrants. Memes show the Statue of Liberty under a burka or niqab, hammer and sickle projected on the Empire State Building, and public transport overcrowded with immigrants in native grab among other bleak outcomes of Zohran Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. “Imagine North Korea… with a dash of Sharia,” goes one rightwing parody of Frank Sinatra’s song New York, New York.Liberals and progressives meanwhile are cockahoop with delight at the resurgence of the left, reflected in a raft of jokes, some of them self-deprecating, on late-night shows. ""Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” riffed Seth Meyers, whose late-night gig on NBC beams from the Rockefeller Center in NYC. Trump’s bete-nore Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show on ABC broadcasts from across the country in Hollywood, Los Angeles, joked that President’s social media post after the rout (“...ANDSO IT BEGINS!) “was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet.”Toilet humor aside, the more serious commentariat agreed on one thing: Mamdani’s rise from an obscure local legislator who polled less than 1 percent when he began his campaign to a monumental victory with over 50 percent vote has electrified American politics. Although he is not eligible to run for the White House (he is not born in the U.S., a Constitutional requirement to run for President), many are already seeing him, or at least his policy prescriptions, as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms.“His smile is disarming, but his ideas are armed to the teeth,” the Wall Street Journal said of Mamdani’s policies, suggesting that his victory could inspire more leftist candidates to challenge moderate Democrats, allowing President Trump to drive home his message of radical left lunatics taking over America. Trump himself is said to have acknowledged that Mamdani is a “talented politician” and “slick talker,” according to one report.So despite railing against the “communist lunatic,” Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Pilloried for his tone-deaf bragging about his new White House ballroom and his hosting a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-o-Lago estate at a time of government shutdown, the President briefly embraced the term “affordability” – which Mamdani flogged during his campaign – while discussing a deal to reduce the price of certain drugs like anti-obesity medications at a White House event on Thursday. Taunted from the left that “Affordability is Trump's word of the week,” the President shrank from the word later, saying “I don’t want to hear about affordability” and insisting that inflation is under control and prices are coming down under him. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats “affordability” issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on Truth Social.But even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation that has been their go-to issue. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher…So, affordability is a problem,” Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has sounded increasingly critical of Trump, in recent weeks, said in a TV interview on Thursday, adding that she is worried about her children’s generation because “they’re having a very hard time. ”Even millionaires and billionaires, said to be decamping NYC in the face of the ""socialist surge"" seemed to acknowledge Mamdani has raised important issues. ""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and NewYorker who contributed $ 1 million to Mamdani's opponent Andrew Cuomo, posted soon after Mamdani's win.","Zohran mamdani won the nyc mayoral election with over 50 percent of the vote.

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed, noting that the process has “entered an indefinite phase” after negotiators failed to narrow key differences, reported Dawn News.Officials and security sources earlier confirmed there was no breakthrough.“The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told the Pakistani daily, indicating the discussions had reached an impasse.Asif said the government had concluded that ""the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan are over,"" signalling the end of the latest round of diplomatic engagement aimed at easing cross-border tensions.The collapse in talks follows weeks of fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that has resulted in civilian and military casualties on both sides, marking the deadliest escalation in years.The violence began after an October 9 explosion in Kabul and another in Paktika the same day which Afghan government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the blasts, and neither side issued details on casualties from the initial incidents.Since October 9, repeated shelling and exchanges of fire have killed dozens, though casualty figures differ widely. Earlier this week, Pakistan's military spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed when Pakistani forces targeted militant hideouts and army positions in Afghanistan after coming under attack.Afghan government spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that assessment, saying only nine Afghan soldiers had been killed and 22 wounded, while claiming that up to 45 civilians had been killed and 102 wounded in the strikes. Mujahid also claimed 58 Pakistani soldiers had been killed, a figure Pakistan disputed, stating that 23 of its soldiers had died in the fighting.The worsening violence prompted Qatar to mediate, bringing the two sides to Doha for talks that led to a ceasefire on October19.Two additional rounds were later held in Istanbul. While both sides say the ceasefire technically remains in place, sporadic attacks have continued.An Afghan official told news agency AP on Friday that overnight clashes in the border region killed four Afghan civilians and wounded five others.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre border known as the Durand Line. Established in 1893, the line cuts through the traditional homeland of the Pashtun people, Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group and the core base of the Afghan Taliban.Although the frontier is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border, Afghanistan has long refused to accept it.",Pakistani defence minister khawaja asif said the dialogue between pakistan and afghanistan has effectively collapsed.

Canada Rejects 74% Indian Student Visas In August, Citing Fraud, As Ties With India Hit New Low





The Canadian government has announced new immigration level plans as the country aims to attract top researchers and H-1B visa holders, reports Bloomberg. Prime Minister Mark Carney presented its first budget where he unveiled a plan to attract international talent, earmarking $1.2 billion to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers. As part of the new immigration plan, the Canadian government has set a target of bringing in 380,000 permanent residents per year from 2026 through 2028.“The expertise of these researchers will help advance our global competitiveness and contribute to the economy of the future,” the budget statement reads.Canada’s new program is expected to draw skilled professionals from the US and other countries. The announcement comes after US President Donald Trump raised H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from September 21, 2025.The Canadian government is also planning an “accelerated pathway” for H-1B visa holders in the coming months. Additionally, it aims to reduce the share of non-permanent residents to less than 5% of the population by the end of 2027. The figure was 7.3% on July 1 this year.Further, the government plans to lower the number of temporary residents to 3,85,000 in 2026 and 3,70,000 in the following two years — a drop of more than 40% from current levels.The sharpest cut will come from study permits, which are set to fall to 1,55,000 in 2026 and 1,50,000 in both 2027 and 2028.The Bloomberg report claims that these figures are significantly lower than the previous targets under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which projected around 305,900 study permits each year between 2025 and 2027.The report quotes Universities Canada, which in a statement said that it “recognizes the government’s efforts to build a sustainable immigration system that welcomes those seeking to study at Canada’s world-class universities, but the plan must match this government’s talent and economic agenda.”","Canada to introduce accelerated pathway for h-1b visa holders.

Tesla shareholders voted to approve CEO Elon Musk's compensation plan potentially worth nearly $1 trillion, with 75% voting in favour.

Tesla announced the results of the vote on Thursday (November 6) at its annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas. The final vote tally is expected to be formalized in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing within days. Musk is expected to achive certain milestones, like selling robotaxi fleet, humanoid robots and more to get the full package.The approval essentially grants Musk enormous influence over the electric vehicle (EV) company and aims to mitigate the risk of him focusing his attention on other ventures.

US President Donald Trump has escalated his attack on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), urging Republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to Americans instead of insurance companies, as the ongoing government shutdown marks its longest stretch in US history.In a new post on Sunday, Trump repeated his demand that Republicans stop sending what he described as vast sums of money to insurers participating in the ACA marketplace.“NO MORE MONEY, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, TO THE DEMOCRAT SUPPORTED INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR REALLY BAD OBAMACARE. THE MONEY MUST NOW GO DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE, TAKING THE ‘FAT CAT’ INSURANCE COMPANIES OUT OF THE CORRUPT SYSTEM OF HEALTHCARE,"" he said on Truth Social.The US President further asserted that the people can buy much better policy on their own, “FOR MUCH LESS MONEY, SAVING, FOR THEMSELVES, AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE!!!”Trump’s remarks follow a similar proposal he posted earlier, in which he pressed Republicans to send ACA-related federal subsidies straight to Americans. He framed the idea as part of a compromise to break the political deadlock over government funding.“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” he wrote on Truth Social.The shutdown began on October 1 and continues without a resolution, after Senate Republicans rejected a proposal from Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. According to CNBC, Democrats offered to reopen the government by allowing ACA subsidies to remain in place for one year, while dropping their demand to extend Obamacare tax credits for a longer period.Those subsidies support more than 20 million people, and without action by Congress, they will expire at the end of December. Democrats say that figure could reach 24 million when counting Americans who are expected to renew coverage.Republicans have dismissed the Democratic plan, insisting that the government must be reopened before negotiations resume on other policy matters. Senate Majority Leader John Thune labelled the Democrats’ offer a “non-starter.”Beyond the funding fight, Trump is also intensifying pressure on Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, the rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. The GOP currently holds 53 seats in the 100-member chamber, with 45 Democrats and two independents aligned with them, CNBC reported.With neither side offering new concessions, the shutdown continues with millions of Americans caught in the middle.","Us president donald trump has escalated his attack on the affordable care act (aca) he is urging republicans to divert federal healthcare payments directly to americans instead of insurance companies.

Aundrea Griffin says love matters more than age as couple faces online criticism







Aundrea Griffin, a 39-year-old influencer from College Station, Texas, is standing strong beside her husband, Ken Griffin, 65, after facing heavy online criticism for their 26-year age gap. The couple met in 2009 at a bar in San Antonio when Aundrea was just 22 and Ken was 48. Despite the big age gap, Aundrea said she was instantly drawn to his calm and kind nature. Speaking to Daily Mail, she shared that Ken made her feel safe, respected, and loved from the very beginning.Aundrea said she found his life experience inspiring, he had two master’s degrees, spoke Italian, and had served in the Air Force for almost 30 years, traveling around the world. “He made me laugh and feel protected,” she said. “That mattered more than his age.”Soon after meeting, the two began dating and quickly faced pushback from family and friends. Some people questioned how a relationship with such a large age gap would work long-term. “My mom was worried at first,” Aundrea admitted. “But once everyone saw how real and balanced our relationship was, they accepted us.”Sixteen years later, Aundrea and Ken are still happily married.They now share five children and are expecting their sixth baby. While their close friends and family fully support them, strangers online continue to judge their relationship harshly. Aundrea, who has over 22,000 Instagram followers, said she often gets “grandpa jokes” and comments calling her a “gold digger.”She admitted that being in public can be uncomfortable because of the stares and whispers. “The hardest part is dealing with how outsiders see it,” she said. “People make assumptions before they even know us.”But Aundrea Griffin said she no longer lets the hate affect her. “It used to hurt, but now I realize it’s just people projecting their own insecurities,” she told Daily Mail. She added that her husband doesn’t care about the online hate at all, “He doesn’t even use social media.”Inside their home, Aundrea said life is peaceful and filled with love and respect. “We don’t live for people on the internet,” she said. “We live for each other and our kids.”Also Read : YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk Despite the criticism, Aundrea Griffin continues to share moments from their life together, showing followers that love can last, no matter the age difference.

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","Nypd figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in october, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani caught the attention of the public, especially Indians, for not just winning the polls but also for an recent video of his. The clip surfaced online just before the US city mayoral elections, showing him casually munching on Rajnigandha silver pearls during a street chat.The short video, recorded by Brooklyn-based content creator Nicolas Nuvan, shows Mamdani stepping out of a black SUV and being asked if he has eaten. “I did eat today,” he replies with a smile, before pulling out a pack of Rajnigandha — a saffron-blended cardamom seed mouth freshener widely popular in India — and adding, “I’ve also started having a lot of these… it’s like a mint.”He then offers some to Nuvan, who tastes it and exclaims, “Oh wow, that’s delicious… it feels like I’m consuming perfume.” Without missing a beat, Mamdani responds, “Perfume you can eat.”The light-hearted exchange has since gone viral and widely shared amid Mamdani’s election, with Indian users flooding the comments section with memes and quips. “No way he just ate Rajnigandha — South Asians will relate,” wrote one user while another, with play on the brand's tagline, replied, “munh mai rajnigandha, kadmon Mei NYC”. A third echoed the brand’s famous slogan, posting, “Muh mai rajnigandha kadmoo mai duniya you did it,"" with another adding, ""Baba elaichi kha rha"".Mamdani, 34, defeated independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa to become New York City’s first Muslim and youngest mayor in over a century. The Indian-origin democratic socialist described his victory as the end of a “political dynasty,” quoting Jawaharlal Nehru’s iconic words: “A moment comes, but rarely in history.”His win celebration also went viral after he walked off stage to the Bollywood hit Dhoom Machale, drawing cheers from supporters.","Zohran mamdani, 34, defeated independent candidate andrew cuomo and republican curtis sliwa to become new york city’s first muslim and youngest mayor in over a century.
