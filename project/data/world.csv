"Army to get 3 Apache attack copters, Navy to induct Seahawks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-to-get-3-apache-attack-copters-navy-to-induct-seahawks/articleshow/125968313.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India’s rotary wing combat capabilities, the Army is now finally set to get delivery of its three remaining Apache AH-64 attack helicopters from the US, while the Navy will also commission its second squadron of MH-60R Seahawk submarine-hunting choppers this week.The induction of these much-delayed American helicopters will plug existing operational gaps but the real punch will come when the Army and IAF hopefully begin getting 156 indigenous `Prachand’ light combat helicopters from 2028 onwards.Overall, the armed forces want over 1,000 new helicopters of different types in the next 10-15 years to make up for major deficiencies as well as replace obsolete Cheetah and Chetak fleets. They include 484 light utility helicopters in the 3.5-tonne class and 419 Indian multi-role helicopters in the 10-15-tonne class, but there have been huge delays in these projects being executed by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The three Apache gunships, dubbed “tanks in the air” since they are armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will touch down in India “within a couple of days”, defence officials told TOI.India had ordered six heavy-duty Apaches for the Army in a Rs 5,691 crore deal with the US in Feb 2020, under which the first three were delivered in July after a huge delay due to supply chain problems faced by Boeing.These six Apaches will add to the 22 such choppers inducted by IAF in 2019-2020 under a Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015. The Army Apaches will be deployed at Jodhpur, where a squadron was raised in March last year to cater for the western front with Pakistan.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, in turn, will commission the second squadron of Seahawks, armed with Hellfire missiles, MK-54 torpedoes and precision-kill rockets as well as advanced sensors, at INS Hansa in Goa on Dec 17. The first squadron was raised at INS Garuda in Kochi in March 2024.The US has so far delivered 15 of the 24 Seahawks, which are manufactured by Sikorsky-Lockheed Martin, under a Rs 15,157 crore contract in Feb 2020. Incidentally, the defence ministry last month inked another Rs 7,955 crore contract with the US for follow-on support and spares for the multi-mission helicopters.While quite expensive, the Seahawks are crucial because the 140-warship Navy is currently grappling with just a handful of old Sea King and Kamov-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters at a time when the presence of Chinese submarines is only going to further increase in the Indian Ocean Region.HAL has to deliver the Prachand light combat helicopters -- 90 for Army and 66 for IAF -- in the 2028-2033 timeframe under the mega Rs 62,700 crore contract inked in March this year.The Prachand helicopters will be armed with 20mm turret guns, 70mm rocket systems and air-to-air missiles for offensive operations and precision-strikes in high-altitude areas like eastern Ladakh and Siachen Glacier on the borders with China and Pakistan.The 156 highly-agile Prachand helicopters, each weighing 5.8 tonne, will add to the 15 such choppers (10 IAF and 5 Army) already inducted under a Rs 3,887 crore contract in 2022.","The army is finally set to get delivery of its three remaining apache ah-64 attack helicopters from the us.

SHANTI likely to boost India’s nuclear power capacity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shanti-likely-to-boost-indias-nuclear-power-capacity/articleshow/125966404.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The Union cabinet’s approval for Atomic Energy Bill, officially titled the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill, 2025, which is set to be tabled in the winter session of Parliament, signals a huge policy shift in India’s atomic sector that is expected to accelerate civil nuclear energy production in the country.Proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment and overcome obstacles in the 2008 Indo-US Nuclear Deal by easing supplier liability concerns (CLNDA), potentially unlocking stalled US projects like Kovvada. Till now, the key stumbling block to US investment in India has been CLNDA, which allows operators to seek recourse from suppliers, deterring US firms like Westinghouse. Legal amendments are expected to address these issues, potentially creating a framework for insurance or govt indemnification and making projects viable for US companies.The amendments are designed to finally implement the stalled Indo-US nuclear agreement, which has led to little progress beyond fuel imports due to liability issues, and enable US reactor construction in India. These nuclear reforms are linked to broader Indo-US trade talks, aimed at boosting bilateral trade and investment, with nuclear cooperation as one of its key pillars.The bill will open up the sector to private players (up to 49% equity) and foreign companies, breaking the long-standing govt monopoly in the sector. It will also consolidate existing laws into a single, comprehensive statute to enhance regulatory clarity and investor confidence and will help India fulfil its goal of creating 100 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2047. The SHANTI Bill will break the domination of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in core activities such as atomic mineral exploration, fuel fabrication, equipment manufacturing and, potentially, certain aspects of plant operations.The trigger for these drastic changes in the legal framework in the nuclear sector was the slow expansion of nuclear power capacity as the technology development phase had to go through an international embargo and technology denial regime, besides facing limited availability of resources. Though India operates the sixth largest nuclear reactor fleet in the world, the present installed capacity of nuclear power is just 8.78 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW). The share of nuclear power in total electricity generation in the country in 2024-25 was about 3.1%, the govt said in a statement.The indigenous pressurised heavy-water reactor (PHWR) technology has now matured for larger size reactors (700 MW). With the deployment of indigenous 700 MW reactors and 1,000 MW reactors with international cooperation, the present capacity will increase to 22.38 GW (excluding RAPS-1, 100 MW) by 2031-32 on completion of projects at various stages of implementation.The preferred small modular reactor (SMR) technology is the light water reactor-based pressurised water technology. Based on PWR technology, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), a constituent unit of DAE, has initiated design and development of 200 MWe Bharat Small Modular Reactor and 55 MWe Small Modular Reactor, for the repurposing of retiring fossil fuel-based power plants, captive plants for energy intensive industries -- such as steel, cement and process industries -- and off-grid applications for remote locations. BARC is also developing up to 5 MWth (Megawatt thermal) high temperature gas cooled reactor for hydrogen generation.","Proposed amendments to the atomic energy act 1962 and later in liability laws aim to attract private and foreign investment. The key stumbling block to us investment in india has been clnda, which allows operators to seek recourse from suppliers. Bill will open up the sector to private players (up to 49% equity) and foreign companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125966405,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-9432,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Congress holds rally in capital to reiterate 'vote chori' claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-holds-rally-in-capital-to-reiterate-vote-chori-claim/articleshow/125966353.cms,"ECs Will Pay When Cong Wins: Rahul

NEW DELHI: Taking his months-long campaign of ""vote chori"" to its climax, Congress's Rahul Gandhi on Sunday led a packed Ramlila Maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"", as he claimed that the Modi-led BJP is winning elections by stealing votes but ""Narendra Modi-RSS govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.Rahul said ""vote chori"" is principally BJP's attack on Ambedkar's Constitution that has enshrined the right to vote. He said BJP's DNA has ""vote chori"" just as truth is Congress's DNA, and accused Election Commission of working at BJP's behest.Interacting with the party workers who had poured in from across the country for the rally, Rahul said PM Narendra Modi has lost his confidence which is reflected on his face, just like Amit Shah's hands were trembling in Lok Sabha when he challenged the home minister to a debate on his press conferences about ""rigged"" elections.""You look at Modi's face carefully. Have you seen it? It is so because he knows his 'vote chori' has been caught, and the country would know their reality in the coming time,"" he said, referring to a point made by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her speech.Planned as a mass gathering to mark the conclusion of the party's nationwide signature campaign on ""vote chori"", the dais featured the Congress brass of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi, CMs Siddaramaiah, Sukhwinder Sukhu and Revanth Reddy, CWC members Ajay Maken, KC Venugopal, Sachin Pilot, Abhishek Singhvi, Gaurav Gogoi and P Chidambaram, among others.In framing the argument made by speakers who linked ""vote chori"" to BJP's desire for victory at all costs, Rahul started his speech by referring to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's reported statement in Andamans that ""world recognises power, not truth"". ""Hindu religion, and ideology of world religions, says that truth is most important, but Bhagwat says truth means nothing and power is important. That is the crux of the ongoing battle in India. It is a fight between 'satya and asatya',"" he said, mentioning ""Satyam Shivam Sundaram"" and ""Satyamev Jayate"".Rahul, as also Priyanka, kept the poll panel in their crosshairs, even leading the crowd in repeating the names of CEC Gyanesh Kumar and ECs SS Sandhu and Vivek Joshi. ""Remember the names,"" they said to the crowd in their separate speeches. Rahul said Congress govt will retrospectively remove the immunity provided to the ECs by the law brought by Modi in 2023, and would act against them, repeating the chilling warning he made during the debate in LS. ""You are India's EC, not Modi's EC,"" he said.","Rahul gandhi led a packed ramlila maidan rally to raise the slogan of ""vote chor, gaddi chhod"" he claimed that the modi-led bjp is winning elections by stealing votes but ""narendra modi-rss govt"" would ultimately be evicted from power.

How Bangladesh’s Feb 12 Vote Could Reshape India’s Northeast Access And Regional Power Balance

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday firmly rejected assertions made by the interim government of Bangladesh, saying New Delhi has consistently supported free, fair and inclusive elections in the neighbouring country and has never allowed its territory to be used for activities hostile to the interests of the Bangladeshi people.In a statement responding to a press note issued by Bangladesh’s interim government, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India ""categorically rejects"" the allegations levelled against it and reiterated that it has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the Bangladeshi people.""India has consistently reiterated its position in favour of free, fair, inclusive and credible elections being held in Bangladesh in a peaceful atmosphere,"" the MEA said, adding that New Delhi’s stance on the issue has remained unchanged.The response came hours after Bangladesh summoned high commissioner Pranay Verma to its foreign ministry, conveying what it described as ""deep concern"" over Sheikh Hasina , who is currently in India, being allowed to make ""provocative statements calling on leaders and activists to engage in terrorist activities"" in Bangladesh.During the meeting, Dhaka also formally sought the immediate extradition of Sheikh Hasina. It further raised what it called ""anti-Bangladesh activities"" by Awami League members residing in India, alleging that they were attempting to disrupt the country’s upcoming national elections.In its statement, the MEA rejected any suggestion that India was complicit in destabilising Bangladesh. ""India has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the friendly people of Bangladesh,"" it said.At the same time, the MEA placed emphasis on Dhaka’s responsibility to ensure stability during the electoral process. ""We expect that the interim government of Bangladesh will take all necessary measures for ensuring internal law and order, including for the purpose of holding peaceful elections,” the MEA added.","India firmly rejects assertions made by the interim government of bangladesh.

'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

Kharge says RSS ideology will destroy the country

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party stood with “satya” (truth) and pledged to oust the “Narendra Modi-RSS government” from power.Addressing the Congress party ’s ‘Vote Chor Gaddi Chhod’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha launched a sharp attack on the Election Commission He named Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar and Election Commissioners Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, alleging that they were working in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party.“We will stand with ‘satya’ (truth) and will remove the Narendra Modi-RSS government from power. They have ‘satta’ (power), and they indulge in ‘vote chori’,” Gandhi said.He claimed that the BJP transferred Rs 10,000 during elections but alleged that the poll panel failed to take action. “In this fight between truth and untruth, the Election Commission is working with the BJP government,” Gandhi said.Gandhi further alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought in a new law granting immunity to the Election Commission and said it would be changed. “(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change this law retroactively and act against election commissioners,” he said.Asserting that truth would ultimately prevail, even if it took time, Gandhi added, “We’ll work with truth and non-violence to defeat Modi and (Amit) Shah.”Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will ""destroy the nation"", Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday pitched that it is only the ideology of the opposition party which will ultimately save the country's Constitution from being destroyed.""Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it. The path the BJP, PM Modi is going, slowly and steadily, they are trying to finish the Constitution,"" Kharge said during his speech.The Congress chief praised Rahul Gandhi for working to ""save the country"" and the people's vote.""Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the country, and to strengthen that fight is the responsibility of us all, that is what I want to request you all. If you do strengthen those ideas then it is your loss, the country's loss, not his loss. If you want to save the country, if you want to save your vote, protect it, if you want to save the Constitution, then you can work for yourself. The work of bringing forward our ideology, ideas, is being done by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, today Priyanka is also doing,"" Kharge said.Launching a scathing attack on the party, Kharge alleged that the ideology of the 'sangh parivar' is looking to enslave people under the guise of Hinduism.""Everyone is there under the Hindu religion, but under the guise of Hinduism, they want to enslave people. If you want to be a slave, if you give up your self-respect, then you will be finished. The freedom we got (from the Britishers) was given by Congress. Did Modi give it? Modi was not even born then.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday held a mega rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital, intensifying its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the special intensive revision of electoral rolls. The protest, held under the banner “Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod”, comes days after sharp exchanges between the government and the Opposition in Parliament over electoral integrity.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""The leaders of the BJP only do drama...Some BJP leaders were questioning whether, after the Parliament session, Rahul Gandhi is going abroad. During the Parliament session, PM Modi never attends the session but goes abroad...They are all sitting in power after doing vote chori, we will have to remove these traitors from power...""Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections, as she addressed the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital.Addressing a large gathering of party workers and supporters, Priyanka Gandhi said elections in the country were no longer being conducted fairly and that suspicion now surrounded every stage of the process.“Elections not being conducted properly, there is suspicion at every step,” she said, alleging systematic erosion of democratic norms.Recalling the constitutional vision of India, she stressed the centrality of the right to vote. “Our voice should reach the PM’s residence. It’s very important to understand that your vote plays an important role. Nehru ji said that the people of India, every single son and daughter of India, are all a part of Mother India. This very thought shaped our constitution. This Constitution gave you the right to vote,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She also alleged that constitutional bodies were being pressured to function in line with the government’s interests. “All institutions in country being made to bend before govt,” she said, while addressing the rally against what the Congress has termed “vote theft”.Priyanka Gandhi further accused the Election Commission of ignoring alleged violations during polls and questioned the integrity of the electoral process. “EC shutting its eyes to Rs 10,000 being paid during election process; is this poll not 'vote chori'?” she asked, referring to alleged inducements during elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, particularly in Bihar, claiming that outcomes were manipulated. “You should not lose heart over losing Bihar, entire country knows BJP wins through 'vote theft',” she said.""In the Parliament hardly there are one or two debates in a session.When Rahul ji raised the issue, Kharge ji raised the issue that we want to debate on the way votes are being stolen through the EVMs, they got scared. They didn't agree. Finally, how did they agree? They said we will even discuss Vande Mataram...I challenge them to fight a fair election. Let them fight on the ballot paper, and they themselves know that they will never win. Today, you don't need to be disappointed that you lost the Bihar election. Because the whole country is watching that they win through theft,"" Priyanka said.The rally also follows Rahul Gandhi’s recent remarks in Parliament, where he termed alleged vote theft as a serious threat to democracy, triggering a political confrontation with the ruling BJP.Addressing the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan, Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack on the BJP, the RSS and the Election Commission of India, alleging “vote chori” and institutional capture.""...Listen to RSS Chief Dr Mohan Bhagwat's statement, the world doesn't look at truth, it looks at power. Whoever has power is respected. This is Mohan Bhagwat's thinking. This ideology belongs to the RSS. Our ideology, the ideology of India, the ideology of Hinduism, the ideology of every religion in the world says that truth is the most important thing. Mohan Bhagwat says that truth is meaningless, power is important. ..I guarantee you from this stage, you will see, by upholding the truth, by standing behind the truth, we will remove Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the RSS government, from India""Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of manipulating elections and alleged collusion between the ruling party and the Election Commission.""They (BJP) do 'vote chori'. Rs 10 thousand were given during the elections...Election Commission of India is working in collusion with the BJP...PM Narendra Modi changed the law to ensure that no action can be taken against the Election Commissioner, no matter what he does""He further warned the Election Commission against acting in the interests of the ruling party.“EC should not forget they are country's EC not of Modi,” Rahul Gandhi said, adding that the Congress would act to restore accountability.Addressing party workers, he said the Congress would repeal legal changes made by the Modi government to shield election officials.“PM Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change that and act against Election Commissioners.”Rahul Gandhi said the fight against the BJP and the RSS would be based on truth and non-violence.“It may take time, but truth will ultimately win; we'll work with truth, non-violence to defeat Modi, Shah,” he said.Several senior Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, attended the rally. Former party president Sonia Gandhi was also likely to be present. Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy joined the event as well.“Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,” Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.According to party sources, Congress units from multiple states mobilised supporters for the rally. A party spokesperson said 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday, raising slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while travelling to the capital.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee made extensive preparations for the programme. Calling the rally historic, he said party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand had already reached Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday targeted the Election Commission of India, alleging institutional bias and warning of consequences for democracy.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal claimed the Congress has collected over five crore signatures nationwide to flag alleged vote theft. He alleged the presence of bogus and duplicate votes, said Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences had exposed irregularities benefiting the BJP, and accused the Election Commission of ignoring Congress complaints while acting against the party.Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of misleading Parliament and alleged that electoral mandates had been stolen in multiple states.""Answering in Parliament is one thing, but they (Home Minister Amit Shah) did not answer our questions; they gave answers from their own minds. They provided incorrect information in Parliament. We had asked how and in what way votes were stolen, and Rahul Gandhi spoke about this with evidence... We want to tell the people that the governments in power in Anand, Maharashtra and Haryana have come to power by stealing votes. .. The people sitting in power today have not been elected by the people...""Congress leader Sachin Pilot said concerns over institutional fairness were being raised across the country. He said ""Across the country today, this question has arisen that fairness and transparency are disappearing from institutions. The attitude adopted by the Election Commission is very unfortunate... The Election Commission should work with fairness and honesty, rising above leaders, ideologies, or parties, which they are not doing. .. The Election Commission is unable to answer... Unfortunately, when we ask questions to the Election Commission, the answers are given by BJP spokespersons.""""Today we are organising a mega rally in Delhi, where workers from across the country will gather and, becoming the voice of the people, will ask the question why the Election Commission is not working impartially?,"" Pilot added.Reacting to the rally, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of using abusive language and promoting disorder.“In the rally held at Ramlila Maidan by the anti-Ram Congress, abusive language and insults were once again used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Videos have surfaced showing their workers once again chanting slogans wishing for Modi's death. This shows that the Congress party is now becoming a platform for anarchy instead of a political party, operating under a Muslim League-Maoist agenda. You want to praise Rahul Gandhi? Go ahead. But the use of such abusive language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has been done before, is utterly reprehensible. Although there is no comparison.”The rally marks a fresh escalation in the political battle between the Congress and the BJP, with electoral processes and the role of constitutional institutions now at the centre of the confrontation.BJP MP Sambit Patra said, ""Today the Congress party is holding a rally against vote theft at Ramlila Maidan. It is being said that people are also coming from other states ruled by Congress. Surprisingly, even after the discussion in the House, the Congress party is holding this rally. This same Congress party had submitted an application in the House for a discussion on SIR. Everyone in the House expressed their thoughts, and the Union Home Minister also responded to them. .. A person who always wears a T-shirt gives a lecture on khadi that day... and from that, their true form is revealed, and they fabricated a story about SIR... They made up the entire story, and when the Home Minister gave point-by-point responses one by one... The Congress party heard about all the issues. When they won in Telangana, Himachal, Karnataka, there was no vote theft, but where the BJP won, there was vote theft... When the Home Minister mentioned infiltrators, that the Congress party is trying to protect the infiltrators, then they created a deadlock and walked out; this clearly shows that this rally against SIR that is happening is an effort by the Congress party to protect the infiltrators...""","Congress mp priyanka gandhi vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, claiming that outcomes were manipulated. Rahul gandhi launches a sharp attack on the bjp, the rss and the election commission of india.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125960644,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-464392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In the middle of Laxmi Nagar market is a single room, easy to miss in the chaos, that holds a few chairs. Seated are young men and women from Delhi, UP and Haryana, busy polishing 'Ikura desu ka' and 'tetsudatte kuremasu ka', Japanese phrases that translate, respectively, to 'how much is this' and 'can you help me'.Some labour on the 'u', only to be reminded by the teacher not to dwell on it. ""Not ikoora. Suppress u, stress ra.""It's not an easy lesson for this group of native Hindi speakers but motivation is strong, so they keep at it. Getting spoken Japanese right will earn them a ticket to a job that will pay more than anything they are likely to get here.With curbs on immigration rising in the West, Indians have in Japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers, especially in caregiving and blue-collar occupations like plumbers and electricians. In Aug this year, the Indian and Japanese governments signed a pact for potential exchange of 5 lakh personnel in five years, including 50,000 skilled workers.And with jobs beckoning, Japanese language teaching has taken off in NCR, not just in physical classrooms like the one in Laxmi Nagar but in online listings of tutors saying 'Konichiwa' to not just Japan job seekers but also those preparing for JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) and anime fans as they promise proficiency tailored to the learner's need.According to data with Japan Foundation on language education abroad, the number of Japanese learners in India went from 5,446 in 2003 to 52,946 in 2024. The total number of teachers - at primary, secondary and higher education levels - has risen from 256 to 5,446 in the corresponding period.Owing to its ageing population, Japan needs caregivers at hospitals and for eldercare. Salaries in these jobs, converted to INR, begin at about Rs 80,000 a month. A nursing qualification is not mandatory; basic proficiency in the language - which is the N4 level - is enough.Sudha Rotili has already secured a job and will be flying to Hokkaido soon. While pursuing a master's in maths from a Delhi University college, she felt her degrees might not be enough to get a good job abroad and enrolled in a Japanese course earlier this year. ""My friend, who is a nurse, learnt it last year and now works in Japan as a caregiver. I thought this was something I could do. It would also give me a headstart abroad,"" Sudha says, adding she will make a saving that will also let her remit money back home.Japanese has three scripts - Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. Though it has almost no similarity to languages widely spoken in India, some teachers say it comes easier to native Hindi speakers because the grammar is similar. ""They do not have to first think of translating to English and then Japanese, they can do a Hindi to Japanese translation in their minds,"" says a teacher.Anushka, a 21-year-old nursing graduate learning Japanese at a centre in Okhla, doesn't know if that worked to her advantage, but is confident about holding a basic conversation in Japanese. ""Watashi wo namae wa Anushka. Hajimemashite (My name is Anushka. Nice to meet you),"" is how she introduces herself to make her point.Anushka says her lack of fluency in English made her apprehensive about attempting to take on Japanese. But once she dived in, she began enjoying herself, downloading an app to practise and watching Japanese TV shows.Jaspreet Kaur, a first-year political science student, says she is ready to take up any job in Japan for the exposure. She enrolled at the Okhla centre this year and will start applying for jobs soon.Divesh Birla, who has been teaching Japanese since 2007, says he gets two kinds of students - schoolkids who want to pick up a language early, and of late, adults who are learning for the purpose of employment. Birla, who teaches at Govt Polytechnic College in Haryana, says many students are coming from lower-income backgrounds. ""They feel like a job in Japan will be their family's ticket to a good life,"" he says. Ambica Gupta, who runs Masaru Institute for Japanese language in Faridabad, says though she has been teaching for the last 12 years, it's only in the last four that she has seen a boom in interest. ""I used to have just two-three students per class, but from 2021, every batch has 10-15 students. I don't want to make the classes bigger, but there are more people expressing interest. Every batch is full,"" she says.Shrishti Arora, who started NEC Institute in Lajpat Nagar seven years ago, adds: ""I've noticed that people who come to us are not just interested in learning the language, they are serious about the opportunities it can get them. They inquire about jobs and higher studies.""(Additional reporting by Ayantika Pal)","With curbs on immigration rising in the west, indians have in japan been presented with a destination in the east that has a high demand for young workers.

SC full court rolls back hikes given by CJIs to select few,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-full-court-rolls-back-hikes-given-by-cjis-to-select-few/articleshow/125965805.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In every organisation, be it government or private, increment in an employee’s salary is an annual affair. Not in Supreme Court, where CJIs, on the eve of retirement and irrespective of length of tenure, used discretionary powers to sanction multiple increments to a select few employees.Those who had been Chief Justice of India for a short tenure, too, granted two or three increments in addition to the annual one in salaries to employees — mainly the chief justice’s personal staff or those who had performed exceptionally well and displayed organisational skills.While all 2,000-odd employees received at least two to three additional increments in their pay scale in the last four years, there were some lucky ones in CJIs’ good books who earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.To correct the anomaly in pay scales and salaries of employees caused by discretionary sanctioning of increments, former CJI B R Gavai had called a full court meeting of all judges to discuss the issue. Most judges felt neither was SC a kingdom nor CJI a king to distribute increment largesse to a select few.After a detailed deliberation, the full court decided to stop this practice and withdraw discretionary increments given to employees in the last few years.It was also decided that discretionary allotment of increments would henceforth be decided in the full court, sources told TOI.Those who had got additional increments, apart from annual increments given every year, suddenly discovered their salaries had been reduced considerably. It came as a shock to those who had planned their budgets based on the increased salary — like taking house or vehicle loans that had to be repaid through EMIs.Some of those who had put in additional work and performed exceptionally well to get the increments said their monthly salaries were reduced considerably, in some cases up to Rs 40,000, and vented their ire against one or two registrars who, according to them, briefed the then CJI incorrectly on the issue.TOI spoke to a cross-section of employees, the majority of whom said that it would have been better had SC adjusted the additional increments against future annual increments. That would have kept their salaries intact and enabled them to maintain household budgets and investments in houses or vehicles.","Some lucky ones in cjis’ good books earned as many as six additional increments to get 150% of what should have been their salaries in the normal course.

NEW DELHI: President Draupadi Murmu on Sunday emphasised the need to use electricity wisely and efficiently and said it not only leads to energy conservation but also reduces carbon emissions Speaking at the National Energy Conservation Awards 2025 at the capital’s Vigyan Bhawan, the President said that energy conservation was not just an option but was crucial for a balanced ecosystem. She said that every unit of energy saved was a symbol of responsibility towards nature, and behavioural change was crucial for bringing energy efficiency to all sectors.“Saving energy doesn't simply mean using less, but rather utilising energy wisely, responsibly, and efficiently. When we avoid unnecessary use of electrical appliances, adopt energy-efficient devices, utilise natural light and ventilation in our homes and workplaces, or embrace solar and renewable energy options, we not only save energy but also reduce carbon emissions,” President Murmu said. She added that sustainable development of the country can be ensured if the youth and children make necessary efforts for energy conservation and that saving energy was equivalent to producing energy.The President also appreciated the Centre’s initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy in the form of the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana and the National Green Hydrogen Mission, and said they helped in reducing dependence on fossil fuels.She noted that India's energy efficiency efforts in 2023–24 resulted in energy savings of 53.60 million tonnes of oil equivalent. She said that these efforts are leading to significant economic savings annually and have also resulted in a substantial reduction in CO₂ emissions. The President added that the government was also promoting renewable energy adoption and energy efficiency through the renewable consumption obligation and production-linked incentive schemes.She also gave away awards for energy conservation and the national painting competition on energy conservation at the event.Union power minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that India had positioned itself at the forefront of the global energy shift by aligning its plans with the goal of limiting the increase in worldwide temperatures to below two degrees Celsius.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday attacked the BJP and the Election Commission , alleging “vote chori” and irregularities in the electoral process, asserting that democratic institutions were being “crushed” and daring the ruling party to contest elections on ballot paper.Addressing the Congress’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan, Priyanka said, “When we see every institution being crushed, all Indians should rise against it,” and alleged that “all institutions in the country” were being made to “bend before the government”.Targeting the poll process, she claimed there was suspicion at every stage.“Elections not being conducted properly, there is suspicion at every step,” she said, questioning the Election Commission’s role. “EC shutting its eyes to Rs 10,000 being paid during the election process; is this not ‘vote chori’?” she asked.Priyanka also challenged the BJP to fight elections without electronic voting machines. “I challenge BJP to contest polls on ballot paper, they know they will never win,” she said, adding, “I challenge them to fight a fair election. Let them fight on the ballot paper, and they themselves know that they will never win.”Referring to the recent electoral outcome in Bihar, she told party workers, “You should not lose heart over losing Bihar, the entire country knows BJP wins through ‘vote theft’.”Speaking about Parliament sessions, Priyanka said the Opposition’s demand for a debate on electoral issues was resisted and a discussion was agreed only when we agreed to a debate on Vande Mataram, while ignoring all the other pressing issues which affect you.“In the Parliament hardly there are one or two debates in a session. When Rahul ji raised the issue, Kharge ji raised the issue that we want to debate on the way votes are being stolen through the EVMs, they got scared. They didn't agree,” she said.Emphasising the importance of voting rights, she said, “Our voice should reach the PM’s residence. It’s very important to understand that your vote plays an important role,” and recalled Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision of universal participation that shaped the Constitution and the right to vote.“Nehru ji said that the people of India, every single son and daughter of India, are all a part of Mother India. This very thought shaped our constitution. This Constitution gave you the right to vote,” she added.The rally comes days after sharp exchanges between the government and the Opposition in Parliament over electoral integrity and the special intensive revision of electoral rolls.","Priyanka gandhi vadra challenged the bjp to fight elections without electronic voting machines. “i challenge bjp to contest polls on ballot paper, they know they will never win,” she said.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated, with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who travelled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: ""Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.""Rajiv S. Khanna, lmanaging attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labelling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of indians on h-1b visas, along with their h-4 dependent spouses and children, are stranded in india.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","Pm narendra modi and president donald trump spoke on thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

Now it is not about finding pilots to operate flights but also ensuring pilots trained for low visibility operations are rostered for the early morning and late night flights in airports that will see fog, like Delhi, Amritsar and Lucknow,” said people in the know.Apart from troubles with IndiGo, aviation authorities are facing another problem: The FOIs are upset at the recent removal of four of their colleagues from their position for allegedly not being able to prevent IndiGo’s fiasco.“FOIs feel they have been made the scapegoats. Some of them now want to quit their positions,” said sources.The DGCA is still trying to prevent more hardships for passengers as low visibility has set it. Two IndiGo flights — Ahmedabad-Hindon & Hindon-Varanasi — have been cancelled. “It was better to have the flights cancelled so that passengers know in advance,” said sources.Even before these latest cuts, flights to and from Hindon Airport had been slashed by half this winter. While the IAF enclave used to handle 25 arrivals and as many departures in summer, the number has dropped to 12 arrivals and as many departures. Now two more IndiGo flights have been cancelled till February.“Hindon has certain restrictions for commercial flights like the operations are from sunrise to sunset and there are two parking bays for them. The reduced visibility has made the operation window even shorter. IndiGo has cancelled two flights,” said an airport official.After Air India, Akasa has also asked the government how long will IndiGo capacity cuts continue so that it can decide on operating some extra flights in the second half of January by when the 31st aircraft it has inducted in its fleet will start flying. The aviation ministry is expected to finalise IndiGo cuts and duration of the same early this week. Air India has offered to explore operating 275 extra flights this month.The 30 Boeing 737s Akasa has in its fleet are being fully utilised. The airlines recently got its 31st aircraft which will start flying next month. The airline is learnt to be able to operate this to partially fill in the void created by IndiGo’s route cuts only in the second fortnight of Jan, and not Feb. “IndiGo flight cut void can at best be filled partially and that too temporarily. AI, AI Express & Akasa resources are nearly fully deployed. AI may have 275 additional flights this month. The best thing will be to have IndiGo back on its feet as soon as possible,” said an official.",An expat top management person (not ceo) is under the scanned and some regulatory action is likely. The operations control centre (occ) has found to be a weak link. Two indigo flights — ahmedabad-hindon & hindon-varanasi — have been cancelled.

Minnesota Rep Ilhan Omar who is at loggerheads with the Donald Trump administration, claimed that her son Adnan Hisri was pulled over by ICE agents Saturday and he was asked to prove his citizenship at a Target store. Omar's son was born in the US and he showed the ICE agents his passport ID and was let go, Ilhan Omar said. She said her son always carried his passport.Omar told CBS News that ICE also previously entered a mosque where his son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she ""had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.""Ilhan Omar came to the US from Somalia when she was a minor and became a US citizen in 2000 when she was 17 years old. In the wake of the allegations of embezzlement by the Somali community in Minnesota, the Republicans have called for Ilhan Omar's deportation and Donald Trump alleged that she married her brother to remain in the US -- an accusation that started as a rumor and Ilhan dismissed it but now turned into a regular jibe of the president.Ilhan Omar has been married thrice: her first husband being Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2002. Critics claim Elmi to be Ilhan Omar's brother, though there is no record to prove that. They parted ways in 2011. In 2008, Omar entered a religious marriage with Ahmed Hisri. They have three children: Adnan, Nur and Isa. The couple divorced in 2011, reconciled and remarried in 2015 and then divorced again in 2018. In 2020, Ilhan Omar marrief Timothy Mynett, a political consultant.",Minnesota rep ilhan omar claims her son adnan hisri was pulled over by ice agents saturday and he was asked to prove his citizenship at a target store.

Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal emerge as bold Los Angeles Dodgers targets

Kyle Tucker is back at the center of MLB offseason talk, and this time the Los Angeles Dodgers are thinking very big. On Friday, December 13, multiple MLB insiders reported that the Dodgers are exploring bold trade ideas that could bring both Kyle Tucker and Tarik Skubal to Los Angeles in the same offseason. The talks picked up after the Dodgers recently added Pete Alonso and Edwin Díaz earlier this week.Tarik Skubal and Bo Bichette are also part of the growing buzz. While the Dodgers look at ways to add more star power, the Boston Red Sox are closely watching Bo Bichette as they try to fix infield gaps before spring training begins in February.Kyle Tucker, who currently plays for the Houston Astros, has become one of the most talked-about names in trade rumors this week.On Friday, ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez said on a Dodgers-focused show that Los Angeles has the talent and money to make something big happen.“They might even do both,” Alden Gonzalez said. “They can go after Kyle Tucker with a short deal that pays a lot each year, or they can use their pitching depth to get Tarik Skubal.”Tarik Skubal is under contract with the Detroit Tigers and is entering the final year of his deal in 2026.The Tigers are expected to discuss an extension this winter in Detroit, but league executives believe a trade could happen if talks stall.Skubal has been one of baseball’s best left-handed starters over the past two seasons and finished near the top of Cy Young voting, according to MLB.com If Los Angeles adds Tarik Skubal, the move would strengthen a rotation that already features several All-Star arms.Any deal would likely involve young pitchers and prospects, something the Dodgers have built plenty of in recent drafts.Bo Bichette is also shaping the market. One of the most expensive infield alternatives on offer will be the former Toronto Blue Jays shortstop.On Friday, MassLive reporter Chris Cotillo reported that the Boston Red Sox are among the teams monitoring Bo Bichette closely.Boston is looking for help after recent infield changes and injuries last season at Fenway Park. Bo Bichette is known for steady offense and strong contact hitting.According to Baseball Reference, he owns a career batting average close to .290 and has multiple All-Star selections.Bo Bichette missed time last season with a knee injury but returned before the postseason and remained productive.Along with Bichette, the Red Sox are also discussing internal options and veteran depth pieces such as Jorge Polanco as they plan their roster for Opening Day in late March.With winter meetings ongoing across the league, these talks are expected to stay active heading into January.Also Read: Kyle Tucker Leaves Big Impression At Blue Jays Tampa PDC As John Schneider Reveals What Stood Out",Mlb trade rumors: dodgers eye bold kyle tucker and tarik skubal deal.

What is Paige Shiver’s Net Worth? Her 55% salary hike and link to the Sherrone Moore scandal fuel nationwide speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-paige-shivers-net-worth-her-55-salary-hike-and-link-to-the-sherrone-moore-scandal-fuel-nationwide-speculation/articleshow/125903484.cms,"University of Michigan football is in turmoil as executive assistant Paige Shiver faces intense public scrutiny. Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Paige's sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on Paige's salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Sherrone Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.“Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel..With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige shiver is an executive assistant at the university of michigan football program.
