NEW DELHI: The US President Donald Trump has once again raised concerns over alleged USAID's $18 million funding allocation for elections in India, questioning the rationale behind spending substantial amounts abroad instead of focusing on American voter participation.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump suggested reverting to paper ballots and proposed seeking India's assistance with electoral processes.""18 million dollars for helping India with its elections. Why the hell? Why don't we just go to old paper ballots, and let them help us with their elections, right? Voter ID. Wouldn't that be nice? We're giving money to India for elections. They don't need money,"" US president said.""They take advantage of us pretty good. One of the highest tariffed nations in the world. We try and sell something. They have a 200 per cent tariff. And then we're giving them a lot of money to help them with their election,"" he added.The criticism follows Trump's ongoing scrutiny of alleged USAID funding across various nations. Previously, he alleged US involvement in election results in India.Also Read : '$21 million going to my friend PM Modi': US President Donald Trump fixates on fund to India for third day in a row During his address at the Republican Governors Association, Trump also criticised funding of $29 million to a firm to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh.""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout.

You have a little firm, you get 10,000 here, 10,000 there, and then we get 29 million from the United States government. There are two people working in that firm. Two people. I think they're very happy, they're very rich.

What the Washington Post report said

NEW DELHI: The Congress party has intensified its attack on the BJP, demanding answers over US President Donald Trump’s claim that he gave $21 million to 'friend' Prime Minister Narendra Modi to boost voter turnout in India.At a press conference on Saturday, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera ridiculed the BJP’s silence, calling the controversy “a matter between two friends.” He accused the ruling party of benefiting from foreign funds and questioned where the alleged money went.“Trump’s statement proves he sent this money to Modi to influence elections. Since we have been questioning voter turnout trends, is this increase due to foreign funds?” Khera asked, demanding a White Paper on funds received by political parties and cultural outfits.Citing a Washington Post report debunking claims of US funding for India’s elections, Khera alleged that the RSS-BJP ecosystem has been making ""wild allegations"" against civil society while benefiting from USAID funds. He pointed out that USAID disbursed $650 million to India between FY 2021 and FY 2024 and questioned its purpose.The Congress leader further highlighted past USAID disbursements, linking them to key political developments, including the rise of Modi as BJP’s PM candidate and the formation of AAP. “Who benefitted from these funds?” he asked, urging legal action against those spreading ""fake narratives"" to mislead the nation.The controversy erupted after Elon Musk’s DOGE platform claimed it had canceled a $21 million USAID grant supposedly meant to boost voter participation in India. Trump quickly amplified the claim, alleging that US taxpayer money was being used to interfere in India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Despite The Washington Post's findings, Trump has continued repeating the allegations without evidence. He recently remarked, “Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.”The Congress has urged that the proposed white paper on foreign funding not be restricted to USAID but should cover all financial assistance from foreign entities operating under law. Congress insisted PM Modi must directly refute what it called ""baseless"" allegations.""The RSS-BJP and their ecosystem are fabricating narratives against credible civil society groups, NGOs, and political parties. These actors must not only be named and shamed but also face legal consequences for misleading the nation,"" said Pawan Khera.Congress also dismissed the BJP’s claims linking a 2012 agreement between the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to foreign electoral influence.""The IFES was engaged by the ECI to develop a curriculum on election management, not to interfere in Indian elections,"" Khera clarified. ""The training material was used for electoral officials worldwide, not for domestic polls. The ECI’s website states that 69,362 officials from 109 countries have been trained under this initiative.""Earlier, Khera had taken to social media to mock the BJP, saying: “In this latest expose on the so-called US funding to increase voter turnout in India, The Washington Post confirms that no such program existed and no such funding was received. For the BJP and its blind supporters, crow is part of their daily diet. Who else will eat crow after this comedy of errors?”The BJP, on the other hand, has been on the offensive, accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The party has yet to respond to the Washington Post report dismissing the USAID funding claim.The BJP, however, dismissed the media report as a ""cover-up"" and branded Rahul Gandhi a ""traitor"" for allegedly seeking external influence in India's electoral process. BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia alleged that the Congress facilitated foreign interference during its tenure, claiming that over $2,000 million in USAID funding entered India between 2004 and 2013, while only $1.5 million was received under Modi’s rule.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has responded to the controversy surrounding USAID funding in India, calling the allegations concerning and stating that the government is examining the matter. His remarks come amid claims by Trump that $21 million was sent to India to boost voter turnout in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections—a claim dismissed by The Washington Post.“Some information has been put out there by the Trump administration people, and obviously, that is concerning. I think, as a government, we're looking into it. My sense is that the facts will come out,” Jaishankar said.He emphasized that USAID was allowed to operate in India in good faith, but recent allegations from the US suggest otherwise. “USAID was allowed here in good faith, to do good faith activities. Now, suggestions are being laid out from America that there are activities which are in bad faith. It’s worrisome, and if there’s something to it, then the country should know who the people involved are,” he added.On Friday, US President Donald Trump raised the issue of $21 million funding for 'voter turnout in India' for the third day in a row and questioned why such substantial amount was being spent abroad when similar efforts could be made towards boosting voter turnout in United States.Trump, who had earlier hinted that the funds might have been used to interfere in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections without giving any evidence, took the Prime Minister's name in his latest remark. ""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout. We're giving 21 million for voter turnout in India. What about us? I want voter turnout too,"" Trump said.While the BJP has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of seeking foreign intervention to defeat Modi, the ruling party has yet to respond to The Washington Post’s report debunking the USAID funding claim. The opposition, meanwhile, is demanding answers from Modi and the Election Commission on the matter.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal expressed concerns over foreign interference, stating that authorities were examining USAID’s financial activities. ""We have seen information put out by the US administration regarding certain US activities and funding. These are obviously very deeply troubling,"" Jaiswal said at a press briefing.Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar voiced concerns over foreign funding’s impact on India's electoral process, urging those responsible to be ""shamed and brought to book."" He called the controversy a ""political Covid"" designed to weaken Indian democracy.According to The Washington Post, the false claim originated when DOGE alleged that USAID had allocated $21 million to India as part of a broader $486 million payment to the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS), a USAID-funded coalition of non-profits working on democratic governance and electoral processes. However, the report, citing three officials familiar with US aid initiatives, stated that no such program existed in India.“We were all shocked to see that claim from DOGE. We don’t know anything about elections in India because we have never been involved,” a USAID official told The Washington Post.Another US official suggested that Musk’s department might have misrepresented the numbers from other programs, saying, “They seem to be conflating figures from unrelated initiatives.”Despite these clarifications, Trump has doubled down on his claims, repeatedly questioning why US funds were allegedly being spent on voter turnout in India. Earlier this week, he remarked, ""Why do we need to spend USD 21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they (the Biden administration) were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government.""","Congress demands wider probe into foreign funding, calls out modi on trump’s claim.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday raised the issue of $21 million funding for ' voter turnout in India ' for the third day in a row and questioned why such substantial amount was being spent abroad when similar efforts could be made towards boosting voter turnout in United States.During his address at the Governors working session, Trump also criticised funding of $29 million to a firm to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh .""And $21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter Turnout.

But what does he know about his own country’s spending? "" Malviya said.This comes amid Trump's ongoing attack on the USAID to strengthen democracy by giving aides to different countries. Earlier, Trump claimed that US was trying to get somebody else elected in India.""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected,"" Trump said.""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.A day later, Trump called the alleged funding a kickback scheme and said that nobody has any idea of what is going on there.""And $21 million for voter turnout in India. Why are we caring about India turnout? We got enough problems. We want our own turnout, don't we? Can you imagine all that money going to India? I wonder what they think when they get it. Now, it's a kickback scheme. You know, it's not like they get it and they spend, they kick it back to the people that send it.

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar alleged that illegal immigrants are influencing India’s electoral process and also stressed the need for public awareness on the issue.Speaking at the 65th convocation of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University on Saturday, he questioned when India would begin deporting illegal immigrants, an action which the US has already taken recently.""Crores of people who have no right to live in India are living here...They are making their livelihood here. They are making demands on our resources. On our education, health sector, housing sector. Now things have gone further. They are intervening in our electoral process,"" Dhankhar said.He urged citizens to create an atmosphere where every Indian is aware of this challenge.Without naming the US directly, the vice president referred to the recent deportation of Indian nationals who had entered the country illegally.""A question should occur to every Indian -- when would we start doing this?"" he asked, adding that the youth should act as a powerful pressure group and question the public representatives and government on their jobs.“Nationalism is our religion and topmost priority,” he said.Touching the issue of religious conversions, Dhankar said that an individual is entitled to follow any religion, however, conversions are happening through temptations. He claimed that such changes in demographics could threaten national stability, citing examples of majority communities being ""finished off"" in certain countries.In a possible reference to allegations of USAID funding efforts to increase voter turnout in India, Dhankhar warned of attempts to manipulate the country’s democratic process. He called for a ""deep, thorough, micro-level investigation"" into these claims.Addressing India's development goals, Dhankhar acknowledged the challenges ahead but remained optimistic. ""We will have to increase our per capita income eight-fold, and therefore all of us must move fast and with commitment. That commitment requires we should believe in our nation.” He further added that commitment to nationalism is non-negotiable as it is directly connected to freedom.Commenting on India’s growth over the last one decade, he said that the country has witnessed ""exponential economic rise, phenomenal infrastructural upsurge, deep digitization and technology penetration,"" adding that no other nation has seen such growth during this period.""This nation is therefore full of hope and possibility. This nation is no longer a nation with potential, but (it is a nation) on rise which is unstoppable.”He said that people have toilets, gas connection, internet connections, road connectivity with infrastructure connectivity is making life easier.“If you have an idea, the government policies will handhold you,"" Dhankhar said.He also praised the rise of start-ups in tier 2 and 3 cities, highlighting that they are emerging from ordinary families rather than traditional business backgrounds. The vice president further stated that social transformation would come through social harmony. ""Social harmony will shape our unity in diversity.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","Us president donald trump acknowledged india's 2024 lok sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" the bjp it department head amit malviya posted multiple clips of pm modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118416406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707576,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

I have been commissioned into the 18th battalion, the Jammu and Kashmir rifles, where you have a Masjid, Gurdwara, Durga Mata, and Mahakal, all under one roof.""General Dwivedi recounted how his subedar major, a Maulvi, would perform Durga Mata Puja without any issues, demonstrating the regiment's spirit of mutual respect. When asked about his own spiritual journey, general Dwivedi said after taking over, he first sought blessings from his unit, Bhakti Dhaam, where he received blessings from his Maulvi, Pandit, and Granthi.""My subedar major, who may be a Maulvi, is able to do Durga Mata Puja, which is not an issue at all. Now, if you see, have I visited any Mashoor (famous) place, Golden Temple or Mahakaal or Vaishno Devi, in the initial stages? No. The first thing I went to was to my unit, Bhakti Dham.

Okay. My father used to always give me the story of freedom fighters or the story of World War II, where we won Vera, who escaped as a pilot. I remember. So all these stories I used to keep reading. And my one brother was a doctor. So I said, no, this is closed. My second brother was an engineer. I said, this is closed. Okay. So third was the army, which was there.
