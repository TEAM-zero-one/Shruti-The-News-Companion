Pakistan Senate Session-349 (Day-04) 29-04-2025

As India and Pakistan grapple with renewed tensions after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack , a video of Pakistani Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan making provocative remarks in Pakistan parliament has gone viral, fuelling diplomatic ire and social media outrage.In a fiery speech delivered in Pakistan’s Upper House on April 29, the senator declared, “The first brick of the new Babri mosque in Ayodhya will be laid by Pakistan Army soldiers, and the first azaan will be given by Army Chief Asim Munir himself.”The comments, invoking the Babri mosque demolished in 1992, came as part of a broader tirade laced with religious and militaristic rhetoric. Palwasha Khan, a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and deputy information secretary, suggested that the path was being laid for a “Muslim government, specifically a Pakistani Muslim government, in the Indian subcontinent.”“There is no doubt, this enmity is not with Pakistan or Pakistanis; this is enmity against Muslims and against Islam,” she said.Issuing a direct threat to India, she warned, “The Senate of Pakistan must send a message, if any hand reaches toward us, then the symbol of their power, the Red Fort of Delhi, will witness a bloodshed that its walls have never seen, and its ramparts will testify to it for centuries to come.”Khan, who represents Sindh in the Senate and previously served in the National Assembly from 2008 to 2013, emphasized that Pakistanis were not weak. “We are not wearing bangles,” she said.Quoting late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , she added, “We have guns, we have arms, we have trees—and if the enemy tries anything, we will hang their corpses from our trees.”Despite the hostile language, she claimed to have no quarrel with Indian citizens. “But let me be clear: we have no enmity with the people of India.”Khan also attempted to draw religious divides within the Indian armed forces, asserting, “The Sikh army will not attack Pakistan because it’s the land of Guru Nanak for them.”She went on to praise Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who is a designated terrorist under Indian law. “I want to salute Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who courageously declared that no Indian soldier will be allowed to cross into Pakistan from Indian Punjab.”Ending her speech with a call to arms, the senator proclaimed, “Our army is not just six or seven lakh soldiers, we have 250 million people who, when the time comes, will stand shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces and become soldiers themselves, God willing.”The speech has since circulated widely on social media platforms, drawing sharp reactions amid the already strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.","Pakistani senator palwasha mohammad zai khan made provocative remarks in pakistan parliament.

This comes amid a review of the situation by the PM-led cabinet committee on security, even as firing exchanges between the rival armies have now spilled over to the international boundary in J&K.Indian Army warned Pakistan Army to desist from ""unprovoked"" small arms firings being initiated by its troops all along the 778-km LoC, from Kupwara, Baramulla and Uri to Naushera, Sunderbani, Akhnoor and Poonch, over the DGMO hotline on Tuesday afternoon.""But later in the night, Pak Army escalated the situation by opening fire in Pargwal sector of the 198-km IB in Jammu region. Our troops are effectively responding in double measure to all ceasefire violations,"" an officer told TOI.The CCS meeting Wednesday, the second since the Pahalgam massacre on April 22, came a day after PM Modi told the military chiefs they had ""complete operational freedom"" to decide on the ""mode, targets and timing"" of the country's response to crush terrorism.Consequently, it is no longer a question if kinetic military options will be exercised but when, while the public messaging was also clearly meant to keep Pakistan on tenterhooks. ""The plans for punitive strikes and the graded dynamic response strategy are already in place. It won't be a knee-jerk response but a calculated, credible and calibrated one under the threshold of a full-fledged conflict,"" a senior officer told TOI.With Pakistan already on guard and mobilising its forces as well as activating its entire air defence machinery, there is however no element of surprise left. A feasible immediate step is for the Indian Army to launch concentrated fire assaults by 155 mm artillery guns, 120 mm mortars and anti-tank guided missiles against Pak Army posts and positions as well as ""terror launch pads"" located near them.""Without crossing the LoC, use of other long-range vectors can also impose serious costs on Pak Army and their infrastructure along the frontier. There are reports Pak Army is facing major shortages of 155 mm artillery shells, with its reserves being sent to Ukraine through third-party channels to make money,"" he said.Then, there are shallow cross-border ground raids that can be carried out by Army Para-Special Forces like the ""surgical strikes"" conducted in Sept 2016 against terror launch pads in four different locations in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack at Uri.Calibrated air strikes also remain an effective though escalatory step, much like the one conducted against the JeM terror facility at Balakot in Pakistan in Feb 2019. ""The IAF did not have the 4.5-generation Rafale fighters during the Balakot air strikes. This time the targets can be the headquarters of JeM at Bahawalpur or LeT at Muridke,"" another officer said.This will involve jets like Rafales, Mirage-2000s and Sukhoi-30MKIs, armed with long-range weapons like the French 'Scalp' air-to-ground cruise missiles, Israeli Crystal Maze missiles and Spice-2000 precision guided penetration bombs, hitting pre-designated targets, as reported by TOI earlier.The military options are being contemplated after a raft of retaliatory diplomatic measures against Pakistan were announced when the CCS met on April 23, which ranged from the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty to downsizing of the Pakistani high commission and revocation of visas of all Pakistani nationals in India.","The use of long-range weapons for limited punitive strikes against pakistan is currently being considered the preferred military option.

NEW DELHI: The Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan spoke via hotline on Tuesday, following Pakistan’s unprovoked firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, reported news agency PTI, citing people privy to the matter.During the conversation, the Indian Army is said to have issued a strong warning to Pakistan over the ceasefire violations. These exchanges occurred against the backdrop of rising tensions between the two countries in the wake of the recent terror attack in Pahalgam.Earlier today, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, met on amid speculations about India's possible retaliation to the Pahalgam terrorist attack in view of its cross-border linkages.The CCS, which met at the Prime Minister's Lok Kalyan Marg residence in New Delhi, is understood to have deliberated on the overall security situation in Jammu and Kashmir following the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, according PTI.As many as 26 male tourists were gunned down by Pakistan-backed terrorists in Pahalgam.

No, we need a balanced approach Yes, it's necessary

NEW DELHI: Hashim Musa , the identified Pakistani terrorist behind the Pahalgam massacre , is a former para commando of Pakistan Army’s Special Forces, investigations into the terror conspiracy have confirmed.Sources told TOI that Musa, now a hardcore terrorist working with the Pakistan-based banned terrorist outfit Lashker e Taiba (LeT), was sent by the LeT masterminds to Kashmir on a specific mission to unleash terror attacks on non-locals as well as security forces. “It is possible that he was loaned by the Pakistan special forces like the Special Service Group ( SSG ), to the LeT,” an officer of the security establishment here said.Para-commandos of SSG are highly-trained in unconventional warfare and specialise in covert operations. The intensive and rigorous training regimen focuses on physical conditioning and mental fitness, besides strategic thinking. SSG commandos are adept at handling sophisticated weapons as well as hand-to-hand combat and have high navigation and survival skills.A senior officer said Musa’s Pakistan Army background — confirmed during the questioning of 15 Kashmir overground workers (OGWs) who have emerged as key suspects in the Pahalgam attack probe for having facilitated the Pakistani assailants by arranging logistics and helping in the reconnaissance — is being seen as evidence of ISI’s role in the Pahalgam terror attack , as also earlier strikes in Kashmir. The latter include the October 2024 terror attacks at Gagangir, Ganderbal, in which 6 non-locals and a doctor were killed, and at Buta Pathri, Baramulla, which had left two Army personnel and two Army porters dead.Musa has emerged as the common perpetrator in all three attacks. Junaid Ahmad Bhat and Arbaaz Mir, two other local terrorists trained in Pakistan, were also involved in the Gagangeer and Buta Pathri attacks but were neutralised in separate encounters with the security forces in November and December 2024. Musa has since been working to carry forward the terror mission to target non-locals in Kashmir, and struck big by killing 26 civilians, including 25 tourists, at Baisaran.The Pahalgam attack investigation has thrown up the involvement of a local network of OGWs and terror facilitators in south Kashmir, who guided the Pahalgam attack team and arranged logistics including shelter and possibly helped in transportation of weapons used in the attack. Detailed reconnaissance of the attack site was carried out with the locals’ involvement, helping in mapping the terrorists’ hiding places before and after the attack.Though the information so far has confirmed the role of two Pakistani terrorists Hashmi Musa and Ali Bhai and as many locals — Adil Thoker and Asif Shaikh — the questioning of OGWs points to the involvement of more Pakistani terrorists.A source said the combing operations in the jungles surrounding Baisaran are at an advanced stage, with the location of the attacks now “reasonably known”. “The search has now been narrowed to a limited area,” an officer told TOI.","Hashim musa, the identified pakistani terrorist behind the pahalgam massacre, is a former para commando of pakistan army’s special forces, investigations have confirmed.

We are Muslims, even if the storm comes, we say 'Allahu Akbar',"" he told news agency PTI, responding to allegations that his son may have had prior knowledge of the attack.Muzammil, who was operating the zipline at Baisaran meadow when terrorists opened fire on tourists, has since been detained and questioned by the NIA and Jammu & Kashmir Police.The remarks came after a tourist from Gujarat, Rishi Bhatt, alleged that Muzammil shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" thrice just before the firing began. “Nine people ziplined before me, but the operator did not utter a word. When I was sliding, he spoke, and then the firing started... He said 'Allahu Akbar' thrice and then the firing started,” Bhatt told ANI.Meanwhile, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti defended the Allahu Akbar remark by the zipliner and echoed similar remarks saying, ""There are some people on social media who are very communal...Like we say, ""Jai Shree Ram"", Muslims say ""Allahu Akbar"" and when we are in any difficulty, we say ""Allahu Akbar""...The government of India must take strict action against those who are spewing venom on social media...""The video, filmed by Bhatt during his zipline ride, captured the chaos as gunshots rang out in the background.

In the wake of the incident, it suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, revoked visas for Pakistani citizens (barring diplomatic categories), and closed the Attari border checkpoint.This has been the deadliest attack on civilians in Jammu and Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama bombing and has sent shockwaves through the tourism sector and local communities in the Valley.","Zipline operator muzammil was heard shouting ""allahu akbar"" moments before the april 22 pahalgam terror attack began.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on late Tuesday claimed that it has ""credible intelligence"" suggesting an imminent Indian military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours.Pakistan's information minister Attatullah Tarar said that Pakistan vehemently rejects “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region,” which was completely “reckless.”""Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident,"" Tarar said.""Indian self assumed hubristic role of Judge, Jury and Executioner in the region is reckless and vehemently rejected.

In such a situation, some strategic decisions had to be taken — and those decisions have been made,” Asif told Reuters.This comes as India is preparing for decisive action against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, which continues to threaten peace in Jammu and Kashmir.The Pahalgam attack, which took place on April 22, left 26 people — mostly tourists, including one Nepalese national — brutally murdered at the Baisaran meadow around 2 pm.It was one of the deadliest assaults in the region since the 2019 Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel.","Pakistan's information minister attatullah tarar said that pakistan vehemently rejects “indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing indications of a retaliation against the Pahalgam terror attack , PM Narendra Modi is learned to have given complete operational freedom to the armed forces to decide on the mode, targets and timing of response to Pakistan.Sources said he expressed full faith and confidence in the professional abilities of the forces and conveyed his go-ahead at a meeting with defence minister Rajnath Singh, NSA Ajit Doval , Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan and the three service chiefs.After the huddle, Modi met home minister Amit Shah and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who had last week said that ""dharma"" required India to punish the enemy.The PM convened a meeting, the second since the Pahalgam attack, of the cabinet committee on security on Wednesday, when other important bodies - cabinet committees on political and economic affairs and the full Union Cabinet - are also scheduled to meet.Earlier in the day, the PM had boosted expectations of an early response to Pakistan with his ""samay seemit hai, lakshya bade hain (we have limited time, and high goals to achieve)"" remark at an education conclave.As the audience broke into applause, Modi paused briefly and said, “I’m not speaking about the current situation.”The clarification, however, did little to dampen the surging anticipation of an effective response, something that Pakistan also appeared reconciled to, on an action-filled day which saw Union home secretary Govind Mohan discussing preparedness with the chiefs of the three services. The heavy agenda for the members of the Union Cabinet for Wednesday also appeared to be putting across a “business-as-usual” reassurance.","Pm clarification fails to dampen anticipation of india response to pahalgam attack.

No, they often escalate tensions Yes, they can help reduce conflicts

NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday withheld Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif's X account, amid rising tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad after the Pahalgam terror attack . The move comes five days after the government had suspended Pakistan government's account.On Monday, the government had banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative, communally sensitive content and misinformation targeting India. Acting on the recommendation of the ministry of home affairs, the ban applies to prominent outlets such as Dawn News, ARY News, Geo News, Samaa TV, and individual creators including former cricketer Shoaib Akhtar.Last week, India had blocked access to the official X (formerly Twitter) account of the Pakistan government, @GovtofPakistan, following a legal request.This move follows a series of diplomatic measures taken by India after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack, including expelling Pakistani officials, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and halting visas for Pakistani nationals. All Pakistani nationals have been asked to leave by 27 April, with medical visas valid until 29 April.Last week, the Pakistan’s defence minister sparked widespread controversy when in a viral video clip in he admitted that Islamabad has historically funded and supported terrorist groups.""We have been doing this dirty work for the United States for about 3 decades... and the west, including Britain...That was a mistake, and we suffered for that, and that is why you are saying this to me. If we had not joined the war against the Soviet Union and later on the war after 9/11, Pakistan's track record was unimpeachable,"" he had said.Asif further said that any attack by India could lead to an “all-out war” between the two nuclear-armed nations, Dawn reported.“If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” Asif told Sky News, adding the world should be “worried” about the risk of full-scale conflict.Rejecting allegations of Pakistani involvement, Asif said, “The reaction that came from Delhi was not surprising... this whole thing was staged to create some sort of crisis.”He also questioned the credibility of The Resistance Front (TRF), the group allegedly behind the attack, saying, “Never heard of that organisation.”","The government on tuesday withheld pakistan defence minister khawaja asif's x account.

Window opens for a reset with Canada as new Liberal govt takes over; PM Modi seeks to unlock opportunities with Carney,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/window-opens-for-a-reset-with-canada-as-new-liberal-govt-takes-over-pm-modi-seeks-to-unlock-opportunities-with-carney/articleshow/120742734.cms,"Canada’s Liberal Party headed by PM Mark Carney returned to power Tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-Donald Trump sentiment. PM Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Carney and express willingness to unlock greater opportunities in ties, while underlining that India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties.For India and Canada, there’s an opportunity now to wipe the slate clean after 20 months of bitterness in ties as Carney talks of rebuilding what he sees as “incredibly important” ties with India. Aware of the dramatic turnaround in Liberal fortunes because of Trump’s policies, and given it held Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alone accountable for destroying the relationship, India had already been looking to rest ties with Canada under the Canadian PM since he assumed office in March but based on “mutual respect and sensitivity”.However, unchecked activities of Khalistan separatists will continue to act as a redline in the relationship for India. Of immediate interest will also be whether Canada invites Modi for the G7 summit it will host in June. Canada has so far not announced the name of any guest country for the event.“I look forward to working with you (Carney) to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,’’ said Modi in a post on X. Modi’s message followed Carney’s declaration of victory even though he failed to get a majority that he had said would allow him to deal with Trump, who has unleashed a trade war on Canada and apparently even sought to annex the US’ northern neighbour, from a position of strength. A record 22 Punjabis were elected to the House of Commons but, importantly for India, pro-Khalistan leader Jagmeet Singh, a thorn in India’s side for years, lost from his own constituency and resigned from his position as the leader of the New Democratic Party.India’s ties with Canada took a body blow last year in October when the 2 countries expelled each other’s high commissioner, following the diplomatic row over the killing of Khalistan leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in 2023. Even before that, with Canada accusing the Indian government of having masterminded the murder without apparently backing up the claim with evidence, India had expelled dozens of Canadian diplomats to ensure parity in diplomatic presence.As things look up, both sides are expected to negotiate the return of diplomats, particularly the high commissioners. Both sides have already identified senior diplomats for the top job, but India would want to make sure that the redlines it has drawn are adhered to by Carney’s government. These include a mature and responsible handling of the Nijjar issue as the case goes to trial - avoiding Trudeau’s sensationalism - foolproof security for Indian diplomats and a crackdown on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities. India continues to hold Trudeau and his indulgence towards Khalistan extremists responsible for the downturn in ties with a country where over 4 lakh Indian students are studying, and which is home to one of the largest Indian diasporas abroad - 1.8 million Indo-Canadians and another 1 million non-resident Indians. However, while India blames Trudeau, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which has investigated the Nijjar case, maintains he only acted based on the information provided by the agency. If India and Canada indeed take steps to normalise the relationship, they will have to see that the process is ring-fenced from the fallout of any damning revelations made during the trial.Carney, who has visited BAPS temple and Gurudwara as PM, has so far not explicitly spoken on the Khalistan or Nijjar issue but he was quoted as saying ahead of the elections there are strains on the relationship that “we didn’t cause to be clear, but there is a path forward to address those with mutual respect and to build out.” An economist by profession, he has identified trade as one of the areas the 2 sides can work on to rebuild the relationship. It is important for Canada to diversify its trade partnerships with other partners in the face of the Trump offensive and Carney, soon after his victory, said Canada stands ready to build a coalition of like-minded countries who share common values.",Canada’s liberal party headed by pm mark carney returned to power tuesday riding a wave of strong anti-donald trump sentiment.
