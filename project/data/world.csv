"Post Op Sindoor, India to fast-track launch of 52 defence surveillance satellites",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-op-sindoor-india-to-fast-track-launch-of-52-defence-surveillance-satellites/articleshow/122149971.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the need for ‘deep’ as well as ‘persistent’ surveillance of enemy territory being reinforced by Operation Sindoor , India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine.Phase 3 of Space-Based Surveillance (SBS) programme, which was approved by the PM-led cabinet committee on security in Oct last year at a cost of Rs 26,968 crore, involves the construction and launch of 21 satellites by Isro and 31 by three private companies.The first of these satellites is to be launched by April next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end, as part of the project being spearheaded by Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS) of defence ministry.“Work is underway to compress these timelines to launch the satellites faster into the low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit. The three private companies that have got the contracts have been told to speed up building of the satellites,” a source told TOI.“The aim of SBS-3 is to cover much larger areas of China and Pakistan, as well as the Indian Ocean Region, with shorter revisit times (interval between two consecutive surveillance sweeps of the same location) and much better resolution.The space doctrine is also being fine-tuned,” he added.Parallelly, IAF is pursuing the case for three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or ‘pseudo-satellites’ that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, as reported by TOI earlier.During Operation Sindoor, which saw intense hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, India used domestic satellites like Cartosat, as well as foreign commercial ones, for tracking military movements in Pakistan. “We need to shorten our OODA (observe, orient, decide and act) loop. The faster India gets the 52-satellite constellation up in space the better,” another source said.India also needs to put in place its satellite shield since China is developing weapons like direct ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare equipment, and directed energy weapons like high-powered lasers to contest or deny other nations access to the space domain.China’s military space programme has expanded from operating just 36 satellites in 2010 to over 1,000 by 2024, with 360 of them dedicated to ISR missions.At a seminar earlier this month, IDS chief Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit had stressed the need to extend India’s “surveillance envelope” while underlining the critical role of “real-time situational awareness” in conflicts.“We must detect, identify and track potential threats not when they approach our borders, but when they are still in their staging areas, airfields and bases, deep within an adversary’s territory,” he said.China’s creation of PLA Aerospace Force in April last year underlined its recognition of space as the “ultimate high ground” in modern warfare. “Their satellites have recently demonstrated sophisticated ‘dogfighting’ manoeuvres in LEO, practising tactics designed to track and potentially disable adversary space assets. They have evolved from a ‘kill chain’ to a ‘kill mesh’ — an integrated network that seamlessly interweaves ISR satellites with weapon systems,” Air Marshal Dixit said.","India plans to fast-track the launch of 52 dedicated satellites for the armed forces. It is also in the process of finalising a comprehensive military space doctrine. The first of these satellites is to be launched by april next year, with all 52 to be deployed before 2029-end.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122149969,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1325035,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Should the international community play a more active role in mediating India-Pakistan relations? Yes, definitely. No, it's a bilateral issue.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Sunday dismissed claims made by the Pakistan army blaming India for a deadly suicide bombing in North Waziristan, calling the statement “deserving of contempt. ”In a response issued in the early hours of the day, the MEA said, “We have seen an official statement by the Pakistan Army seeking to blame India for the attack in Waziristan on 28 June. We reject this statement with the contempt it deserves.”Also read: 'Explosive-laden vehicle rammed into convoy': 16 Pakistan troops killed in North Waziristan suicide attack MEA's response comes after at least 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed and more than two dozen people injured in a suicide bombing on Saturday.

It is expected to assist policymakers in identifying key areas that need focused interventions and was released to mark Statistics Day.The report also showed that the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions has declined sharply from 24.85% in 2015-16 to 14.96% in 2019-21. SDG (No Poverty) seeks to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions worldwide. At the global level, this goal has seven targets to measure the progress of nations in eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions everywhere. It said 13 indicators have been identified at the national level to measure and monitor the progress of these targets and data for all the indicators were available in the report.The indicators include population covered by social protection, senior citizens provided institutional assistance and access to basic services.The target is by 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day, and the data snapshot showed that the ""national indicator is under development"". Recent World Bank data stated that extreme poverty rate in India had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23.This would mean that nearly 269 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during this period. World Bank had said the international poverty line for low income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 and for lower middle-income countries it was changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day. The report cited latest household consumption expenditure data to show that there was a ""clear move toward more equal spending and reduced income inequality"" in urban and rural areas.It showed that the percentage of population using an improved drinking water source in rural areas has increased from 94.57% in 2015-16 to 99.62% in 2024-25, indicating significant progress towards universal safe water access in rural India. Among other data, it showed that the gross value added in agriculture per worker (in Rs) has increased from 61,247 in 2015-16 to 94,110 in 2024-25, indicating improved agricultural productivity and income per worker in the country. The total number of internet subscriptions (in millions) has increased from 302.36 in 2015 to 954.40 in 2024, showing a sharp rise in digital connectivity. The number of startups recognised under 'Startup India' increased from 453 in 2016 to 34,293 in 2024, showing strong growth in entrepreneurship.The SDG report serves as a vital resource for policymakers, enabling the identification of areas that require intensified and focused interventions. It showed ""notable progress"" has been made in several sectors, ""significant challenges"" continue to persist in others. United Nations General Assembly, in Sept 2015, adopted the document titled 'Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development'. It outlines 17 SDGs and 169 associated targets.

Those who imposed Emergency not only murdered our Constitution but also had the intention to keep the judiciary as their slave,” he said.The PM noted that over one lakh people were jailed, and politicians like George Fernandes were chained, with many enduring “severe torture” under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA).He mentioned Jagjivan Ram, who called the post-Emergency election “a great campaign to strengthen the foundation of democracy”, and Vajpayee, who described it as “a peaceful revolution” that “threw the killers of democracy into the dustbin of history”.Shifting to other issues, the PM also mentioned the 10th International Day of Yoga (IDY) on June 21, which saw global participation.He highlighted events like three lakh people practising yoga on Visakhapatnam beach, 2,000 Adivasi students performing 108 surya namaskars, and ITBP soldiers practising in the Himalayas.","Modi played archival audio recordings of speeches by former prime ministers morarji desai and atal bihari vajpayee.

Player insight reveals deeper pressure behind departure



Toronto Maple Leafs era ends as Mitch Marner moves on



Mitch Marner's impending departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs, added an emotional twist to the 2025 offseason. As for many years, Marner has been a mainstay in Toronto's top lines, producing two-way play of the highest calibre. His farewell, a nostalgic media appearance. Also with past-tense references, fans and analysts believe the writing is on the wall.Mitch Marner’s expected departure is more than just a roster change. It necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of Toronto’s structure, identity, and short-term objectives. The club now has a rare opportunity to reset over $10 million in cap space and recalibrate a roster that has long underperformed in the playoffs, especially in high-pressure postseason moments where offensive depth and defensive reliability often faltered.Trade and free agent speculation will dominate the coming weeks, with potential targets like Elias Lindholm or Martin Necas being floated but nothing can truly replace the consistency and chemistry Marner brought to the Maple Leafs lineup.What truly made Marner’s farewell resonate was his candid reflection on the off-ice toll of playing in Toronto. He spoke of the strain on his family, especially his wife Stephanie, as the hockey-mad city often directed its frustrations toward him during playoff losses.The stress of being a high-profile figure in a market as intense as Toronto likely played a large part in his decision, and the opportunity to play elsewhere, possibly with the Anaheim Ducks or Seattle Kraken, two teams with strong rebuild potential and passionate yet less invasive fan bases. This could bring the balance and freedom his personal life demands.For Marner, this isn’t just a hockey decision, it’s a personal pivot aimed at preserving both performance and well-being in the next chapter of his NHL career.Mitch Marner’s career with the Maple Leafs was more than numbers. It was connection, growth, and at times, heartbreak, from a hometown hero to a polarizing figure under pressure. Marner’s evolution mirrored the highs and lows of a team struggling to meet its potential.Now, as Toronto prepares to write its next chapter.

Stock market recommendations: According to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBICAP Securities, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, and LT Foods are the top stock picks for the upcoming week. Here’s his view on Nifty, Bank Nifty and the top stock picks with a 3-month horizon:The squeeze sets the stage—the breakout steals the show. For 31 trading sessions, the Nifty moved in a narrow consolidation range, building silent pressure with every passing day. Like an audience holding its breath before the climax, the market was coiling, waiting for a trigger. That moment finally arrived this week, as Nifty broke free from its range-bound structure, delivering a sharp upside move that ended the week above the 25600 mark, with a 2.09% gain.More importantly, this move led to the highest weekly close since September 2024, confirming that the breakout wasn’t just symbolic—it was structural. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a sizable bullish candle, a visual expression of strong momentum and renewed buying conviction.This breakout was not an isolated event. It comes with improving breadth across sectors such as Financial Services, Private Banks, Oil & Gas, Infrastructure, and Auto, many of which have also seen breakout patterns of their own.Backed by strong technical indicators and firm sectoral participation, Nifty now looks poised to extend its northward journey in the coming weeks and is likely to test the level of 25800, followed by 26100 in the short term. While, on the downside, the zone of 25400-25350 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.The stage was set in silence—now, the spotlight is on the bulls.Bank Nifty has been displaying notable strength lately, backed by a series of compelling technical indicators. Most prominently, the index has registered fresh all-time highs over the last two trading sessions—clearly outperforming the broader Nifty index, which remains nearly 2.5% below its own record high. This relative outperformance reflects strong sectoral leadership from banking stocks.A key bullish trigger has been the recent Stage-2 cup pattern breakout on the daily chart—a well-known continuation formation that typically precedes a strong upward trend. Furthermore, Bank Nifty continues to trade above all its crucial short-term and long-term moving averages, signalling well-supported price action. Momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD remain firmly in bullish territory on both daily and weekly timeframes, highlighting sustained strength and trend acceleration.In summary, the alignment of breakout patterns, moving average support, and strong momentum across timeframes suggests that Bank Nifty is likely to maintain its bullish trajectory. As per the measure rule of cup pattern the upside target is placed at 59000 level. While, on the downside, the zone of 56800-56700 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.On the daily chart, the stock has registered a breakout from an Ascending Triangle pattern, supported by robust volume participation—signalling strong buying interest and a bullish continuation. This breakout not only validates the underlying strength but also marks a shift in sentiment after a period of consolidation.Currently, the stock is trading well above all its key moving averages, with each of these averages sloping upward, indicating a well-established uptrend.Adding to the bullish momentum, the daily RSI has also broken out of a two-month consolidation range, confirming the pickup in strength and signalling that the stock may be entering a fresh upward phase. Together, these technical developments suggest that the stock is likely to see continued upside in the near term.Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 7320-7280 level with a stoploss of Rs 7000. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 7900 in the short term.The stock recently found strong support near its 100-day EMA, which acted as a reliable cushion during the recent decline. Following this support, the stock witnessed a sharp upside rally, indicating a strong reversal from this crucial demand zone. What adds conviction to this rebound is the robust volume accompanying the move—highlighting renewed buying interest from market participants.Interestingly, the daily RSI also respected the 40 level, which is often considered a key support in bullish range shifts. The sharp pullback in RSI from this zone reinforces the view that momentum is regaining strength and the stock may be transitioning into a fresh bullish phase.Overall, this confluence of price action, volume confirmation, and momentum resilience points toward a potential continuation of the upward move in the near term. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 485-480 level with a stoploss of Rs 450. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 540 in the short term.","Sudeep shah, head - technical research and derivatives, sbicap securities, says apollo hospitals enterprise, and lt foods are the top stock picks for the upcoming week. He says nifty broke free from its range-bound structure, delivering a sharp upside move that ended the week above the 25600 mark.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122144760,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77878,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"'Be Zohran Mamdani, not Vivek Ramaswamy': Internet divided on whether it should be the other way round",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/be-zohran-mamdani-not-vivek-ramaswamy-internet-divided-on-whether-it-should-be-the-other-way-round/articleshow/122147039.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy or Zohran Mamdani? Politics aside, Internet is debating who is more American.

'Nothing can be more wrong'



'Be Zohran Mamdani, not a Vivek Ramaswamy'



Debate over who's more American







Indian-Americans are divided over Zohran Mamdani, the NYC mayoral candidate of Indian-origin, and Vivek Ramaswamy , the Indian-origin GOP leader who is a Guv candidate of Ohio. While Ramaswamy fell out of MAGA favor after his rant against American culture, Republicans have no love for Mamdani -- but the Indian-American community feels there should be no comparison between Vivek Ramaswamy and Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani fans think Mamdani is what Vivek Ramaswamy could not become, while Ramaswamy fans think Mamdani has not achieved anything to be compared to Ramaswamy -- one of the youngest billionaires in the US.Their only point of comparison is their Indian origin, though none of them was born in India. Ramaswamy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio; Mamdani was born in Uganda.Dr Lavanya Vemsani, author and professor, said some far left handles on social media are comparing Vivek Ramaswamy with Mamdani but nothing can be more wrong. ""Vivek is a successful businessman and well liked Republican candidate running for the Governor of an important state, Ohio. Zohran is running as a mayor and doesn’t really have any career accomplishments to show other than a mediocre music gig and working for his mom. He is just having fun running and creating fake larger-than-life-projection of himself. This is just a self-fulfilling story for Zohran than anything purposeful for New Yorkers,"" Dr Vemsani posted on X.""Zohran Mamdani ran a very clever campaign while Vivek Ramaswamy destroyed his career with a tweet,"" one wrote.""Zohran Mamdani is what everyone thought Vivek Ramaswamy would be last year,"" another wrote.One particular post fawning over Mamdani said: ""Oh the Indian origin kids of America, when given a choice, be Zohran Mamdani. Not a Vivek Ramswamy.""Some people put them in the same bracket and said both of them should be deported. ""We shouldn’t support either, but Mamdani is also a communist who explicitly identifies as anti-White. His religion and race are not the only factors to mention. Vivek is an anchor-baby – both he and Mamdani must be deported IMMEDIATELY,"" one wrote.Another simultaneous debate that took off on X was who is more American between Zohran Mamdani and Vivek Ramaswamy. People pointed out that though Vivek Ramaswamy has America First ideals, Mamdani seems more assimilated in American culture.","Vivek ramaswamy or zohran mamdani?

James Harden faces lawsuit from Houston party incident while Los Angeles Clippers await his decision

James Harden may be lighting up Paris Fashion Week with style and swagger, but trouble is brewing behind the scenes. As fans obsess over his bold fashion statements, a serious lawsuit tied to an incident at his Houston home has surfaced. And just days before a critical decision with the Los Angeles Clippers, the timing couldn’t be more intense.On June 24, a lawsuit was lodged in Harris County, Texas, accusing James Harden of negligence following an alleged sexual assault that happened at his Houston home on New Year’s Day 2025. The plaintiff, Marisa Watley, alleges that she and two friends were drugged by Harden’s nephew, Justice Armani Blackburn, and that the security personnel at Buffalo did not prevent the assault or permit her friends to re-enter the house to assist her. The suit is asking for over $100,000 in damages and claims that Harden is vicariously liable due to the inaction of his security team.As legal issues hover, Harden grabbed attention with his fashionable look at Paris Fashion Week. He shared a photo with the caption “Paris Fashion Week, I went all Luther V I feel like Vandross #Uno,” he drew reactions ranging from 🐐 emojis to fashion praise. Fans implored him to return to Houston, with comments like “That jacket so 🔥” brightening up his feed.Simultaneously, teammates Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook were noticed, making a cultural impact that for the moment overshadowed the courtroom stress.In the midst of the legal turmoil, Harden is faced with a crucial athletic decision that could shape his career. By June 29, he has to choose whether to pick up his $36.3 million player option for the 2025–26 season with the Clippers. After a 50-win season and a first-round playoff exit against the Denver Nuggets, the Clippers are banking on him opting out to pursue a longer-term contract. With four main players approaching or over 30, LA is eager to secure their veteran star before the free agency buzz intensifies.Also Read: “Day 45… this is some bull**” — Jayson Tatum Gets Real About How Tough Achilles Rehab Has Been At 35, Harden continues to be an essential offensive force — he averaged nearly 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists in 79 games, earning All-NBA recognition. But this offseason, he's facing a trifecta of challenges: legal troubles, a significant contract decision, and public perception shaped by his glamorous Parisian lifestyle. Each aspect poses a risk to his legacy and the Clippers' strategy for competing.","A lawsuit was lodged in harris county, texas, accusing james harden of negligence following an alleged sexual assault that happened at his houston home on new year's day 2025.

At least two people, suspected to be firefighters, died during a sniper ambush in US's Idaho on Sunday (local time). Fire crews were at Canfield Mountain to put off a blaze when gunshots rang out about 30 minutes later, according to the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office.“We don’t know how many suspects are up there, and we don’t know how many casualties there are,” AP quoted Sheriff Bob Norris saying. “We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris added.“I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize, because they’re not at this point in time showing any evidence of wanting to surrender,” he said.The sheriff said that since people are still making their way down the mountain, it’s “safe to assume” that others remain on it.Condemning the attack, governor Brad Little said that “multiple” firefighters were attacked. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters,” Little said, adding, “I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more.”The Kootenai County emergency management office urged the public to steer clear of the Canfield Mountain Trailhead and Nettleton Gulch Road area, about 4 miles north of downtown Coeur d’Alene, as the fire remained active, officials said.","At least two people, suspected to be firefighters, died during a sniper ambush in us's idaho on sunday.
