'Case being handled with significant attention': Belgium govt on Mehul Choksi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/case-being-handled-with-significant-attention-belgium-govt-on-mehul-choksi/articleshow/119508956.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Belgian government is closely monitoring the case of fugitive Indian businessman Mehul Choksi, while authorities in Antigua & Barbuda have confirmed that he left the Caribbean nation for medical treatment but remains an Antiguan citizen.David Jordens, Spokesperson and Head of Service for social media and press at Belgium's Federal Public Service (FPS) Foreign Affairs, stated that the case is being handled with due attention. ""I can confirm that the Federal Public Service (FPS) Foreign Affairs is aware of this case and attaches great importance and attention to it. However, we do not comment on individual cases. Furthermore, this case falls under the competence of the Federal Public Service Justice,"" he said.His remarks indicate that while Belgian authorities are tracking developments, jurisdiction over the matter primarily lies with the justice department. Jordens also reaffirmed that FPS Foreign Affairs remains engaged with the case but did not disclose further details regarding Choksi’s location.Meanwhile, Antigua & Barbuda’s Foreign Minister, E.P. Chet Greene, confirmed Choksi’s status, stating, ""Mehul Choksi is not on the island, I am told he left Antigua for medical attention abroad. He remains a citizen of Antigua & Barbuda. Your Government and my Government are working together on this matter. We have some traditions in democracy. We both respect the rule of law. Matter of Mehul Choksi has been subjected to legal review. Until such time it is reviewed and determined, there is nothing I can say, or any of us can say or do.""Choksi, wanted in India for his alleged role in the Rs 14,000-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam along with his nephew Nirav Modi, has been under legal scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. Greene emphasised that India and Antigua & Barbuda continue to cooperate while ensuring adherence to legal procedures.A media report from Associated Times, which covers the Caribbean region, recently claimed that Choksi has been living in Antwerp, Belgium, with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after obtaining a residency card. The report further alleged that Choksi submitted “false declarations” and “forged documents” to Belgian authorities while applying for residency, failing to disclose his Indian and Antiguan citizenships.The report also suggested that Indian authorities have requested Belgium to initiate Choksi’s extradition . However, there has been no official confirmation from Indian officials. Choksi is allegedly planning to relocate to Switzerland for medical treatment at a cancer hospital, according to sources cited in the report.","Mehul choksi is wanted in india for his alleged role in the rs 14,000-crore punjab national bank (pnb) scam along with his nephew nirav modi.

On the other hand, the IT sector posted gains, driven by positive global cues stemming from expectations of softer tariffs and a recent correction in valuations. In the near-term, investor sentiment is expected to be cautious as they await clarity on trade policy between US-India.

He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru.

Parliament is not beyond the law, says HC



Rashid's counsel counters NIA's objections



Rashid's terror funding case



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh , also known as Engineer Rashid, currently jailed in a terror funding case , abides by the law while attending Parliament.The court later reserved its order on Rashid's plea to participate in the ongoing session.Discounting the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) concerns over losing control of the accused within Parliament premises, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, ""Let’s not see ghosts. Let’s not feel so powerless that ‘oh my God, inside Parliament he will do this or that.’ He will be in our custody. Our arms are long enough and strong enough to keep him in line.""After hearing submissions from both the NIA and Rashid’s counsel, a bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Bhambhani stated that a detailed order would be passed soon.The court suggested that the NIA’s apprehensions could be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on Rashid if he is permitted to attend the session, which runs until April 4. Rashid’s counsel clarified that his plea was not for custody parole but for permission to attend the House while remaining in custody. He assured the court that Rashid would strictly comply with any conditions imposed.The court specified that the Speaker and the secretary general of the Lok Sabha possess sufficient authority to maintain discipline inside Parliament.""We are not granting him bail. He is in custody, and our officers will be with him at all times, except where they are not allowed. He will be in the highest temple of democracy—inside Parliament. Do not undermine the power of the Speaker and the Secretary General to enforce discipline,"" Justice Bhambhani said.In response to the NIA’s insistence on Rashid’s role in the case, the bench assured, ""We do not for a moment undermine the seriousness of the allegations. National security is paramount.""The court also suggested allowing a prison or police official in plain clothes to accompany Rashid inside Parliament if necessary.Facing strong opposition from the NIA, Rashid’s counsel argued that the Parliament’s marshals would maintain strict control over his actions.""The moment he switches on his mic to say anything inappropriate, his mic will be taken away, and he will be thrown out,"" Rashid’s lawyer said.To this, Justice Singh said, ""Then it will become a national issue that his mic has been taken away and he has been thrown out by the marshals.""Rashid’s counsel also informed the court of plans to challenge a March 19 trial court order denying him regular bail.Rashid, an Independent MP from Baramulla who defeated Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, is facing trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a 2017 terror funding case. He was arrested by the NIA in 2019 and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since.The NIA’s case against Rashid stems from allegations that he financially aided separatists and terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.His name surfaced during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali, a co-accused in the case. A special NIA court framed charges against Rashid in 2022 under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy, sedition, and waging war against the government, along with UAPA provisions for terror funding.The Baramulla MP was previously granted interim bail for a month in September 2023 to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.The high court has now asked the NIA to suggest additional conditions that could be imposed if Rashid is allowed to attend Parliament, reserving its final decision.",Jammu and kashmir mp abdul rashid sheikh is currently jailed in a terror funding case.

NEW DELHI: The bogey of foreign interference continues to plague India-Canada ties with Ottawa listing India among countries that could interfere in the Canadian elections that will be held on April 28.A top Canadian intelligence official said Monday that India has both intent and wherewithal to interfere in Canada’s democratic processes.Canada has in the past too accused India of interfering in its domestic politics. Canadian Security Intelligence Service deputy director Vanessa Lloyd said it was China that was likely to use AI to influence the election campaign but added that India, Russia and Pakistan could also interfere in the elections.“We have also seen that the govt of India has the intent and capability to interfere in Canadian communities and democratic processes to assert its geopolitical influence,” said the official.Canadian PM Mark Carney , who replaced Justin Trudeau earlier this month, has called snap polls on April 28 seeking a strong mandate in the middle of an internecine tariff war with the Trump administration, or what he has described as “the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump’s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty”.The remarks by the Canadian official follow a period of relative quiet and dialling down of tensions that have rocked the relationship since Trudeau accused New Delhi of facilitating the murder of a Khalistani separatist and Canadian national, Hardeep Singh Nijjar . Carney has expressed interest in rebuilding ties with India, and Indian govt too has said it hopes to do the same based on mutual trust and sensitivity.CTV News quoted the official as also saying that Pakistan could conduct foreign interference activities against Canada in line with its strategic aims and to counter India’s influence. “Pakistan could potentially conduct foreign interference against Canada in line with its strategic aims to promote political, security and economic stability in Pakistan and to counter India’s growing global influence,” added Lloyd.",Canada has in the past too accused india of interfering in its domestic politics.

Trump says he knows 'nothing' about officials texting Yemen war plans to reporter in group chat

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed a journalist's accidental inclusion in a group chat discussing Yemen air strikes as a ""glitch"" and maintained support for his senior national security team despite the security breach.In a telephone interview with NBC, Trump, who resumed office in January, stated the breach was ""the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.""The president further defended National Security Advisor Mike Waltz saying he ""has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.""Offering clarification on how the situation unfolded, Trump said that ""it was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there,"" regarding Goldberg's receipt of a connection request from a user identified as Michael Waltz on Signal.This comes after Trump, earlier in the day, had avoided acknowledging the breach. During Monday's interaction with the media, Trump had responded by saying, ""I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time."" He subsequently dismissed The Atlantic's claims by remarking that it was ""not much of a magazine.""The incident is centred around Monday's report by The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg about conversations on the Signal messaging application, to which he was also added, leading to intense scrutiny for the Trump administration. Senior officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance along with Waltz were involved in discussions about attacks on Iran-backed Huthi rebels, in the chat.Goldberg reported being added to the chat two days before the Yemen strikes, receiving messages from officials designating representatives for the operation. While the leak could have compromised operations had Goldberg published details beforehand, he refrained from doing so.The report revealed internal views about key allies. Someone identified as Vance expressed reluctance about the strikes, criticising ""bailing Europe out again,"" noting European nations faced greater impact from Huthi shipping attacks than America.Messages attributed to Hegseth and Waltz argued only Washington could execute the strikes, with the Defense Secretary acknowledging Vance's ""loathing of European free-loading"" and describing Europeans as ""pathetic.""The White House intensified its response on the second day of the incident, after acknowledging the breach on Monday.However, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had stated on X that ""no 'war plans' were discussed"" and ""no classified material was sent to the thread."" She criticised Goldberg for his ""sensationalist spin.""Leavitt indicated the White House Counsel's Office ""has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible."" The administration was also ""looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread.""Hegseth, previously a Fox News presenter without experience managing a large organisation like the Pentagon, stated late Monday that ""nobody was texting war plans.""Democratic leaders have condemned the breach, suggesting potential illegality and requesting an investigation into officials' use of commercial applications for sensitive discussions.As the concerns around reported data breach spread, US Senate Intelligence Committee's Republican chair, Senator Tom Cotton, told Fox and Friends the group chat matter ""will come up"" during the hearing. ""John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard and the other leaders will have a chance to address it, but I do hope that we keep the focus on the decisive action that the president took against these outlaw rebels in Yemen,"" Cotton said.The Huthi rebels, controlling much of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the ""axis of resistance"" of pro-Iran groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile attacks on vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, claiming solidarity with Palestinians.","Trump says he knows 'nothing' about officials texting yemen war plans to reporter in group chat.

With a tough immigration policy being followed by the US government and key agencies including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), putting green card holders under heightened scrutiny; many Indians who are living and working in the US with legal permanent resident status (green cards) are worried.A recent statement by US Vice-President, JD Vance , that a green card “doesn’t give you an indefinite right to stay in the US”, has sparked concerns among thousands of Indians who are in the US on green cards. However, many experts and immigration attorneys feel that there’s no need to panic for most Indians who are on green cards and may need to travel outside the US, including on visits to India.“Though green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity, most Indian professionals are law-abiding and tax-paying individuals. They don’t need to panic. As long as they follow US laws, avoid criminal activities, maintain strong ties to the US, and avoid extended stays abroad, they have little to worry about,” feels Neha Mahajan , co-founder of Skilled Immigrants in America (SIIA), an organisation supporting Indians stuck in long green card queues. She adds that green cards aren’t automatically at risk unless someone engages in actions that violate immigration rules or national security policies.The green card is a status of permanent resident in the US; hence strong ties to the US are important. “One can have multiple residences but the US government wants America to be the permanent residence of green card holders,” says Manjunath Gokare , an attorney based in Atlanta, Georgia, who specialises in immigration. Law requires that the green card holder must live in the US (maintain a home or apartment); maintain employment in the US; file income taxes in the US on all income earned globally; and maintain US bank accounts and driver’s licence.An important factor for green card status is the duration of travel outside the US and long absences are not recommended. “A stay of less than six months outside the US typically does not raise questions. A stay of more than six months but less than one year could result in additional scrutiny upon arrival in the US. A stay beyond one year without a valid re-entry permit (Form I-131) may lead to the presumption that you have abandoned your green card,” says Mumbai-based immigration lawyer, Poorvi Chothani.For green card holders, it is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. “Keep your green card valid and on you and renew it on time and always carry the original when you are travelling. Keep your US bank account, active health insurance, driver’s licence, and tax records up to date,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should file taxes as resident (1040) and not as non-resident.Given the increased scrutiny at ports of entry, it is wise to carry certain documents for green card holders returning from overseas. “These include pay stubs from your current employment (last 3 months); employment verification letter and last year’s W-2 form and federal income tax return copy,” says Gokare.It is very important for green card holders not to have been convicted of any criminal offences (classified under US immigration laws as aggravated felonies) that render them deportable or removable, under US immigration laws.“If one is maintaining their permanent residence in the US and does not have any criminal convictions, then there is nothing to worry about. Green card holders that are targeted by CBP, typically have either residency issues or removable criminal convictions,” says Gokare. He adds that green card holders who believe that they have always complied with the law, but are yet facing issues at the port of entry, should ask the CBP officers to set up a ‘deferred inspection’.“With an appointment for deferred inspection, a green card holder is allowed to provide evidence and can be accompanied by a lawyer when they meet with CBP officers to present their case as to how they are maintaining permanent residence in the US,” he says.If faced with tough questions at a US border, green card holders are advised not to sign any forms; including Form I-407; which is the record of abandonment of legal permanent residence status; without consulting their lawyers, even if there is pressure from CBP. “No one is legally required to sign it. If they refuse, CBP cannot unilaterally strip them of their green card without due process,” says Chothani.Despite providing evidence of resident status and ties to the US, if CBP officials ask green card holders to renounce their green cards on arrival, there are still certain potential recourse measures that can be taken up.“Those who have been outside the US for an extended period should be prepared for questioning by CBP officers. If placed in secondary inspection, it is best to remain calm and provide clear responses regarding ties to the US,” says Chothani.Secondary inspections can take up to two hours to clear and Gokare advises anyone facing such inspections to co-operate with the officers and not get alarmed. Even if CBP insists that a green card holder is inadmissible or has abandoned their green card, they can still request a notice to appear before an immigration judge. This allows them to fight the case in immigration court rather than surrendering the green card at the airport.“If an individual’s green card is revoked, they may still have a few options including filing for a motion with the USCIS or immigration court to reopen or reconsider and applying for a returning resident visa to regain LPR status,” Chothani says.Finally, five years after getting their green cards, those who are eligible can consider US citizenship. “It’s the best way to make sure you don’t have to worry about losing your status,” says Mahajan. She adds that green card holders should stay engaged; follow rules and not let small mistakes put their status at risk.","A recent statement by us vice-president, jd vance, has sparked concerns among thousands of indians who are in the us on green cards. It is important to keep certain documents with them and to make sure that they are valid and updated. Green cards can be revoked for certain reasons, including national security risks or criminal activity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119419169,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1054902,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In an interview with, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed he had brought the heavyweight boxing championship belt won by Oleksandr Usyk to the White House and planned to gift it to President Donald Trump as a show of goodwill.

""He has family, loved ones, children. He has to feel the things that every person feels. What I wanted to show were my values.

Zelenskyy left the White House without Usyk's belt, and he is not sure what happened to what was the actual gift for Trump.""Maybe it's still sitting there,"" Zelenskyy said.A White House staff reportedly confirmed tothat the belt was eventually picked up and was put in Trump's private dining room with other gifts.“But in that moment there was the sense of not being allies, or not taking the position of an ally,” Zelensky said. “In that conversation, I was defending the dignity of Ukraine.”","Zelenskyy showed trump gruesome photos of ukrainian prisoners of war instead of handing him the gift that he brought.

Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO?

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions. The arson incidents are being treated as 'domestic terrorism' by the Donald Trump administration who sympathized with Elon at this time of crisis.Elon, however, brushed aside the emergency and adviced shareholders to hold on to their shares -- in a surprised all-hands meeting of Tesla.Gerber said the Tesla Board can't do anything against Musk as it solely functions for the benefit of Elon and is highly compensated by him. ""They're not going to do anything he doesn't say,"" Gerber said.Newsweek reported that Tesla shareholders don't have the power to directly vote to remove the CEO. But they could influence the Board if they believe Musk's leadership endangers their investment. ""An ouster would likely occur if enough board members—facing pressure from large investors—determined that Musk's actions or controversies significantly harmed Tesla's performance or reputation,"" David Park, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.Gerber believes Tesla is suffering because of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- the department that he has been leading solely after Vivek Ramaswamy's exit. DOGE has a mandate to cut the government spending within a year and after that DOGE is supposed to stop functioning.As the world's wealthiest individual, Musk has assumed a prominent position in President Donald Trump's second term, heading DOGE. However, his engagement in politics has sparked investor unease, leading to Tesla's poor market performance throughout 2025.In 2025, Tesla's share value has declined by 37 per cent, following Musk's controversial political statements and decisions. Recent weeks have also witnessed increasing incidents of Tesla vehicles being targeted for vandalism including gunshots fired at Tesla dealerships, or targeted in arson attacks.Read more: Tesla arson attacks investigated as 'domestic terrorism,' backed by radical group tied to 2020 riots",Long-time tesla investor ross gerber has called for elon musk's exit from the company.

Federal agents also searched two Columbia-owned residences on 13 March in connection with her case, they said.Legal challenges against Trump’s crackdownThe Trump administration has made Columbia University a central focus of its crackdown, cutting $400 million in federal funding on the grounds that the school failed to protect Jewish students from alleged harassment. Trump has framed pro-Palestinian campus demonstrations as antisemitic, while activists argue they are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.On Tuesday, a group of university professors sued the Trump administration, calling its policies against foreign students and academics unlawful. The lawsuit, filed by the American association of university professors and the American federation of teachers, also seeks to reverse the funding cuts to Columbia.""The policy prevents or impedes Plaintiffs' US citizen members from hearing from, and associating with, their non-citizen students and colleagues,"" the lawsuit read.The Ivy league university responded by introducing measures to address antisemitism and regulate protests, but the administration has stopped short of fully meeting Trump’s demands.Khalil, who played a prominent role in leading student negotiations with university authorities, remains detained in Louisiana while his lawyers fight his deportation. Chung, in contrast, was not a high-profile protest organiser. Her lawyers acknowledge she was arrested and released for ""obstruction of governmental administration,"" with the case still pending in the New York courts.Todd Wolfson, of the American association of university professors, warned that the administration's actions could have broader implications.""The Trump administration is going after international scholars and students who speak their minds about Palestine, but make no mistake: they won't stop there,"" he said.","A us judge blocked the trump government's order to detain and deport a columbia university student.

'We made a mistake'

US President Donald Trump addressed a security breach incident on Tuesday where Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to a classified Signal group chat discussing sensitive military operations against the Houthis.According to Trump, the breach likely occurred when a junior staff member working for national security adviser Mike Waltz somehow included Goldberg in the high-level discussion group. The chat, named ""Houthi PC small group,"" included 18 senior officials coordinating the US military response to Houthi aggression.In an interview with Newsmax, Trump said, ""And what it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission; somebody that was with Mike Waltz — worked for Mike Waltz at a lower level — had, I guess, Goldberg's number or called through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call.

Besides Waltz, some of the members were individuals who identified themselves as vice president JD Vance, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, treasury secretary Scott Bessent, CIA director John Ratcliffe, Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy Steve Witkoff, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, homeland security adviser Stephen Miller, and others.The national security adviser said that he was not sure how Goldberg ended up on the chat.""This one in particular, I’ve never met, don’t know, never communicated with,” Waltz said.Later Tuesday, Waltz said in an appearance on Fox News Channel's “The Ingraham Angle” that he built the message chain and that White House technical experts were trying to figure out how Goldberg's contact “may have been sucked in.”“We made a mistake.

After multiple hearings, Cain Velasquez gets sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment over broad daylight shooting

In 2022,, a former UFC heavyweight champion, went on a vigilante spree when the fighter fired multiple rounds at a vehicle carrying the man accused of molesting his four-year-old son. Harry Goularte, a 46-year-old man, has been accused of multiple cases of child molestation, mostly those enrolled at his mother’s daycare facility. The vehicle had two other individuals in it, one of which was the accused’s stepfather, who got hit twice in the firing incident. After multiple hearings at the court, Velasquez in August 2024 pleaded “no contest” to charges of attempted murder. Following this, the fighter was sentenced toon March 24, 2025. This judgment has created a severe rift of discontentment amongstand the members of the combat sports community.Cain Velasquez’s defense attorney, Renee Hessling, was not very convinced of the court decision since they hoped that prison time would be something that would not be in the books. Hessling appreciated the strength and courage shown in the last three years by the American fighter.“Throughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,” Hessling stated. “He has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.”Harry Goularte’s family spoke to the reporters as well post-the hearing. His mother Patricia Goularte and stepfather, Paul Bender, were not satisfied with the hearing of the court.“The sentence is extremely disappointing. It’s based on an alleged allegation that has no basis. It is unfounded.” Goularte’s mother claimed to have evidence that proves her son’s innocence: “We are looking for the opportunity in Harry’s case to prove that, as we do have ample amount of evidence to do that. It’s sad that the court system and the public can be influenced by simply somebody stating something with no facts.”The MMA community came together to vouch against the decision of the court and supported the fighter for showing courage against the accused molester. Brazilian lightweight contender Renato Moicano posted on X supporting Velasquez for his actions.“It’s crazy that Cain Velásquez was sentenced to 5 years!!! The only thing he did wrong was missing the target!!!”Bryce Mitchell posted a story on Instagram that pleaded for the release of Velasquez and instead proposed for appropriate dealings with the child molesters.“Pardon Cain Velasquez and put these child molesters to death. That's what I would do”Former UFC Lightweight Champion, Khabib Nurmagomedov posted a story on Instagram as well with the caption “Stay Strong Lion”While the fighters have started joining hands in the plead for justice, fans have taken over X, to express their grief over the decision and suggested alternatives to approach the case.One of the users wrote, “I don’t think a five years sentence is fair, one year max would have been enough, after all he was justified for what he did.”Another one stated, “Free Cain Velasquez!”“@danawhite use your super powers to oil up Donald Trump and get Cain Velasquez pardoned”“Dana White better hit up Donald TRUMP ASAP!

I've done it over the years,"" Trump said in an interview with Newsmax.US was conducting separate negotiations with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia, focusing on establishing a potential limited ceasefire, which could be a significant advancement towards ending the conflict.Earlier in the day, US announced achieving a preliminary accord between Ukraine and Russia through separate negotiations, aiming to halt hostilities and secure safe maritime passage in the Black Sea.However, numerous specifics remained unresolved, and the Kremlin linked the agreement to the removal of certain Western sanctions.The statement came following three days of discussions in Saudi Arabia between US officials and separate delegations from Ukraine and Russia, focusing on potential steps towards a limited ceasefire.Although a full peace agreement remained a distant prospect, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy viewed the discussions positively, describing them as initial ""right steps"" towards peacefully resolving the 3-year conflict.""These are the first steps — not the very first but initial ones — with this presidential administration toward completely ending the war and the possibility of a full ceasefire, as well as steps toward a sustainable and fair peace agreement,"" he stated during a press conference.The White House issued separate statements following the Riyadh meetings, where US specialists met individually with Ukrainian and Russian officials.Both parties reportedly ""agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.""""We are making a lot of progress,"" US President Donald Trump had earlier said at the White House. ""So that's all I can report,"" he added.Earlier, a Russian negotiator previously said that discussions between Russian and US officials regarding a partial Ukrainian ceasefire were constructive and would continue, expressing interest in expanding participation to include the UN and additional nations.""We talked about everything, it was an intense dialogue, not easy, but very useful for us and the Americans,"" Grigory Karasin told Russia's TASS news agency.""We will continue it,"" he added after the delegations concluded 12 hours of hotel negotiations in Saudi Arabia.Earlier this month, talks took place in Jeddah, following Trump's criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.During those sessions, while Kyiv accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, Russian President Vladimir Putin declined it.","Us was conducting separate negotiations with russia and ukraine in saudi arabia, focusing on establishing a potential limited ceasefire.

Stranded in ice cold Alaska lake: How did a pilot and 2 children survive the cold night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stranded-in-ice-cold-alaska-lake-how-did-a-pilot-and-2-children-survive-the-cold-night/articleshow/119507538.cms,"A pilot and two children miraculously survived for about 12 hours on the wing of a partially submerged plane in an icy Alaskan lake before being rescued by the Alaska Army National Guard on Monday.The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser had taken off from Soldotna on a sightseeing flight to Skilak Lake on Sunday but never returned. With no locator beacon on board, a desperate search began after a Facebook post urged local pilots to help find the missing aircraft.Among those who joined the search was Terry Godes, who flew his own plane over the rugged terrain of the Kenai Peninsula early Monday. As he approached Tustumena Lake near a glacier, he spotted what looked like wreckage.“It kind of broke my heart to see that,” Godes said.However, he could spot three people on the top of the wing as he got closer and to his amazement, they were alive.“They were alive and responsive and moving around,” he said, adding that they waved at him as he flew over.Godes immediately alerted fellow searchers. Another pilot, Dale Eicher, relayed the coordinates to authorities, as he was closer to Skilak Lake and had better mobile reception.The Alaska Army National Guard dispatched a rescue helicopter from Anchorage, initially planning to hoist the survivors off the wing. However, strong rotor winds made it too risky, especially for the youngest child. Instead, the crew carefully manoeuvred alongside the wreckage and pulled the three on board.Lieutenant colonel Brendon Holbrook, who led the rescue operation, said the adult male had suffered from hypothermia, likely after falling into the water, while the children were relatively dry.The team initially planned to rescue the three survivors off the wing, but the powerful rotor winds made it too dangerous, especially for the youngest girl, who was being tossed around by the force, said Lt Col Brendon Holbrook, commander of the Guard’s 207th Aviation Regiment. Instead, the helicopter carefully positioned itself alongside the wreckage and brought them on board.“They spent a long, cold, dark, wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren’t planning on,” Godes said.Temperatures had dipped well below freezing overnight. The survivors had only basic clothing suitable for small-plane travel, but nothing to protect them from the extreme cold and biting winds.“It was literally the best possible scenario and outcome,” Holbrook said. “That plane was in the ice with the tail refrozen. If that tail hadn’t refrozen, it would have sunk.”The cause of the crash remains unknown, and the national transportation safety board, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, has launched an investigation.Tustumena Lake, a vast 60,000-acre body of water about 130 kilometres southwest of Anchorage, is notorious for its sudden, treacherous winds. Meteorologists say the surrounding mountains and glacier contribute to unpredictable turbulence in the area.Godes, who knows the region well, described it as a “recipe for chaos.”“Even under what would be considered a benign or relatively weak pressure gradient, the terrain helps turn the winds around, and occasionally they get a little squirrelly,” said Michael Kutz, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.The crash follows a string of recent aviation tragedies in Alaska. Last month, 10 people died when a small commuter plane crashed into sea ice near Nome. In 2019, a midair collision near Soldotna killed seven people, including a state lawmaker.While Monday’s crash could have ended in another tragedy, rescuers say luck and a series of small miracles kept the pilot and children alive.“It's a cold dark place out there at night,” Godes said.",A pilot and two children miraculously survived for about 12 hours on the wing of a partially submerged plane in an icy alaskan lake.

South Korean firefighters make progress in containing wildfires in southeastern regions

South Korea has initiated a full-scale nationwide response to combat lethal wildfires in the southeastern region, said the acting president on Wednesday.""This is a full-scale national response,"" the acting president Han Duck-soo said announcing the elevation of the national wildfire crisis to its highest level.Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.A safety ministry representative confirmed to AFP, ""Eighteen people died in the wildfires. Additionally, six people were seriously injured and thirteen suffered minor injuries.""Arid and gusty conditions have impeded fire containment efforts. The president informed an emergency meeting that the fires were ""developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations.""Despite Tuesday afternoon's emergency evacuations, casualties occurred. The situation worsened overnight with power outages, communication disruptions, and blocked roadways.According to Han, despite thousands of firefighters being deployed, strong winds of 25 metres per second prevented aerial operations using helicopters and drones. He noted that changing wind patterns and persistent dry conditions highlighted the inadequacies of traditional firefighting approaches.Han announced ongoing evacuations to temporary shelters and government efforts to provide emergency assistance and financial aid to displaced residents.Rainfall expected later Wednesday might assist in controlling the fires.Reports indicate the Uiseong fire started accidentally when someone tending to a family grave site unintentionally sparked the blaze.","Multiple fires erupted over the weekend, with casualties increasing to 18 as one substantial blaze devastated villages and destroyed a historic temple.
