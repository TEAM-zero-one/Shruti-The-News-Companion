Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that donald trump had secretly died, was put to rest on saturday when the president was photographed teeing off at his virginia golf club.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","Us federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president donald trump under emergency powers were illegal.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","Pm narendra modi landed in tianjin saturday evening for what is his first visit to china in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Trump’s ‘Worst Nightmare’ Comes True: Putin’s Friends Modi & Xi Are All Smiles In China, Hold Talks





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago mayor brandon johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist us president donald trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

Ties looking up but key border difference remains; India says border peace insurance for ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-looking-up-but-key-border-difference-remains-india-says-border-peace-insurance-for-ties/articleshow/123621680.cms,"From Border Dispute to Terrorism: Vikram Misri Details Key Issues Raised in Modi-Xi Talks

As he reiterated the significance China attaches to a dragon-elephant tango, at a time the world is seeing “once-in-a-century"" transformations, President Xi Jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.These included deepening strategic communication and mutual trust, expanding exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefits and win-win results, accommodating each other's concerns and strengthening multilateral cooperation to safeguard common interests.While talking about accommodating concerns though, Xi reiterated China’s long-held position – stressed repeatedly during the eastern Ladakh military standoff – that India and China should not allow the border issue to define the overall China-India relationship.This latest assertion of the Chinese position that development of the relationship be ring-fenced from the border issue will likely see India treading cautiously in its efforts to normalise the relationship with China.Responding to the Chinese readout of Xi’s remarks, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said PM Narendra Modi had made it very clear that the boundary situation will have an impact on bilateral relations.“I would just say that we have been stating this from the beginning, and, on different levels, that the situation on the boundary will have an impact on bilateral relations in certain ways. Because of this, the insurance policy for bilateral relations is to maintain peace and tranquility on the boundary. So, even the Prime Minister has made this very clear,” said the foreign secretary.According to the Indian readout too, Modi underlined the importance of peace and tranquility on the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations. During the standoff that lasted for well over 4 years, India had maintained that there would not be business as usual until the border issue was resolved.However, the border issue was not a deal-breaker in the meeting that Modi described as fruitful. Xi also said India and China should work together to maintain border peace and tranquility and agreed with Modi that there has been peace and stability in the border areas since their meeting in Kazan last year.Xi told Modi an elephant-dragon dance is the right choice for both countries, while describing the global situation as both chaotic and fluid. “We are the world's two most populous countries, and we are also, equally, members of the Global South. We both shoulder the historical responsibility of improving the well-being of our two peoples, promoting the solidarity and rejuvenation of developing countries, and promoting the progress of human society,” said Xi in his opening remarks in the meeting.“It is the right choice for both of us to be friends, to have good neighbourly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other's success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,” he added.Unlike the Indian statement, the Chinese readout made no direct mention of trade or terrorism but it quoted Xi as saying that the relationship will flourish as long as the 2 countries act as partners and not rivals. While Modi said a stable India-China relationship is important for both multipolar world and multipolar Asia, Xi only mentioned multipolar world while underlining the need to work together.On Sunday, Modi also had a separate meeting with Cai Qi, Member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, and a powerful political ally of Xi. According to Indian authorities, Modi shared with Cai his vision for bilateral relations and sought his support to realise the vision of the 2 leaders. Cai reiterated the Chinese side's desire to expand bilateral exchanges and further improve relations in line with the consensus reached between the two leaders, said the government.","President xi jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship with pm narendra modi.

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the kailash yatra on his motorcycle on saturday.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The army is raising the first lot of five 'bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

Amid the threat of India-US ties sliding into a semi comatose state, and the global unease over US’ coercive trade policy, PM Narendra Modi joined hands with President Xi Jinping to expand “common ground” on bilateral, regional, and global challenges including fair trade and terrorism – both otherwise sticking points in bilateral ties - in multilateral platforms.As relations improve, Modi agreed with Xi that India and China are development partners, not rivals. It’s China which has mostly used that formulation in recent times. They also agreed their economies can help stabilize world trade.Significantly, Modi explicitly mentioned India’s strategic autonomy in the meeting saying both countries follow it, and their ties should not be seen through a third country lens. The reaffirmation of strategic autonomy on Chinese soil, which found a rare mention in an Indian press statement, is reassuring for both Beijing and Moscow, and is also a message to top Trump administration officials who have accused India of “cosying up” to China.Modi and Xi also committed to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question, from the political perspective of overall relations and long-term interests of the people of India and China.On whether Trump’s tariff policy was discussed, officials said the leaders focused on working towards long-term growth and development of both countries and dealing with the challenges posed by global trade disruption.Modi invited Xi for the BRICS summit next year in India and the president offered support for India’s upcoming presidency.The hour-long meeting in Tianjin, on the margins of the SCO summit, did not see any major announcement, but helped solidify the recent improvement in the relationship as Modi underlined the significance of maintaining peace and tranquility along the border areas for continued development of ties and Xi committed to reducing the trade deficit between the 2 countries.“They underlined the need to proceed from a political and strategic direction to expand bilateral trade and investment ties and reduce trade deficit,” said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, adding Modi and Xi agreed common interests outweigh differences between India and China. Modi said in a post on X he had a fruitful meeting with Xi, as they reviewed the positive momentum in relations since their last meeting in Kazan. “We agreed on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility in border areas and reaffirmed our commitment to cooperation based on mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity,” said Modi, welcoming the return of peace and stability in the border areas and the recent agreement between the Special Representatives for border management.Modi also welcomed the decision to resume direct flights between India and China.Modi told Xi a stable relationship and cooperation between India and China and their 2.8 billion people on the 3 mutuals (respect, interest and sensitivity) is necessary for the growth and development of the two countries, welfare of all humanity as well as for “a multipolar world and a multi-polar Asia befitting the trends of the 21st century”.On the framing of the relationship as partners, and not rivals, Misri said this is what was desirable. Modi and Xi also called for strengthening people-to-people ties through direct flights and visa facilitation, building on the resumption of Kailash Manasarovar Yatra and tourist visas.Modi and Xi also discussed the border issue in detail noting with satisfaction, as the Indian readout said, the successful disengagement last year and the return and maintenance of peace and tranquility along the border areas since then. They reiterated differences should not be allowed to turn into disputes.“They expressed commitment to a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question proceeding from the political perspective of their overall bilateral relations and the long-term interests of the two peoples. They recognized the important decisions taken by the two Special Representatives in their talks earlier this month and agreed to further support their efforts,” said the Indian statement.In the SR talks in August, both sides had agreed to set up an expert group to explore Early Harvest in boundary delimitation in the India-China border areas. Another working group to advance effective border management and maintain border peace is also being set up.","'india-china partners, not rivals': pm modi stresses 'strategic autonomy' in talks with xi jinping.
