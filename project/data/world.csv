This itself demonstrates our momentum and dynamism. The pace and depth that our bilateral relations have achieved in recent years are truly inspiring. I sincerely thank you for your invaluable contribution in this regard...""Highlighting sectoral cooperation, PM Modi said: ""Today, our cooperation is deepening in every sector, from agriculture and manufacturing to clean energy and semiconductors.

One remarkable feat is this decision to use local currency as far as possible...""He stressed the importance of education and academic exchanges, noting India’s growing global standing in higher education.""Education remains pivotal. Many Malaysians were educated in India, and there is a growing number of Indian students in Malaysia too, but since the last decade or so under the premiership of my good friend Prime Minister Modi, you have seen the spectacular recognition of Indian centres of excellence in education. That's not only comparable but many of them have achieved outstanding recognition beyond the known institutions in the West. Therefore, we would certainly explore this to increase the number of students in the disciplines and fields to study in India...""Anwar Ibrahim also flagged tourism and connectivity as priority areas, linking them to visa liberalisation and increased air links.""... Tourism and connectivity are areas that we will have to give more emphasis. We have seen this spectacular increase during the past year, and we hope to benefit from Malaysia Truly Asia and Incredible India through visa liberalisation and increase air connectivity. I have been to India several times and covered hundreds of places, and I still think that I have not covered India. It's too huge, Prime Minister, and it's an amazing country to visit, to learn the history, the culture, the arts, other than the new advancement in the technology. ..""On regional and global issues, he said discussions with PM Modi reflected trust and candour.""In terms of regional and international issues, I must express my appreciation because in my discussions with Prime Minister Modi, it is not just normal bias platitudes and diplomatic exchanges. It is an exchange between true friends, full of trust and understanding...""The Malaysian Prime Minister also praised PM Modi’s role in global peace efforts and announced support for opening a new Indian consulate.""I must also take this opportunity to express my regards and thanks to PM Modi for his firm commitment to support all peace efforts throughout the world, be it in Ukraine, Russia or in the case of the Middle East, particularly in Gaza, his commitment to support the peace process is unequivocal and certainly I must therefore express my appreciation.

US presses for new nuclear architecture



Push for three-way talks with China



Trump had hinted at testing earlier

NEW DELHI: The United States has accused China of conducting a covert nuclear explosive test on June 22, 2020, just days after the deadly Galwan Valley clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, saying the allegation underscores the need for a new global arms control framework following the expiry of the New START treaty.On June 15, 2020, a week before the alleged nuclear test, the Indian and Chinese troops clashed in Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, while reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 35.US Under Secretary of State Thomas G DiNanno said China used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.""China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons… China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide its activities from the world. China conducted one such yield producing nuclear test on June 22, 2020,"" DiNanno said in a post on X.The date cited by the US official comes a week after the June 15, 2020, Galwan Valley face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clashes, while intelligence reports at the time estimated Chinese casualties at over 30.DiNanno’s remarks came as the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, formally expired this week, leaving the world’s two largest nuclear powers without binding limits on their strategic arsenals for the first time in more than five decades.""New START was signed in 2010 and its limits on warheads and launchers are no longer relevant in 2026 when one nuclear power is expanding its arsenal at a scale and pace not seen in over half a century and another continues to maintain and develop a vast range of nuclear systems unconstrained by New START’s terms,"" DiNanno said.He said the treaty imposed uneven constraints on nuclear powers.""…almost all of the U.S. deployed nuclear forces were subject to New START while only a fraction of Russia's much larger stockpile was… exactly zero Chinese nuclear weapons were covered by New START,"" he said.DiNanno said alleged covert testing by China, alongside Russian violations and the growth of global nuclear stockpiles, made it necessary to pursue a new arms control framework suited to present-day threats.""This confluence of factors – serial Russian violations, growth of worldwide stockpiles, and flaws in New START’s design and implementation – gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era,"" he said.He added that Washington was now in a position to strengthen deterrence while remaining open to meaningful negotiations.""No longer constrained by the political-military circumstances of 2010 and the treaty they yielded and in response to the destabilizing behavior of these other countries, the United States can now finally take steps… to strengthen deterrence on behalf of the American people and our allies,"" DiNanno said.The US has renewed calls for three-way nuclear arms control talks involving China and Russia following New START’s expiration. Washington has said any future agreement must include Beijing, a demand China has firmly rejected.China has denied the US allegations of covert nuclear testing and has said it will not participate in disarmament negotiations at this stage, arguing that its nuclear arsenal remains far smaller than those of the United States and Russia.US President Donald Trump had previously hinted at similar accusations without offering details. On October 31 last year, Trump said Washington would begin nuclear testing ""on an equal basis"" with Moscow and Beijing, without elaborating on the nature of such tests.Analysts have warned that the end of New START marks a turning point in global nuclear stability, with the absence of formal limits increasing the risk of a renewed arms race amid rising geopolitical tensions and mistrust.","Us under secretary of state thomas g dinanno said china used techniques designed to evade international monitoring systems while carrying out yield-producing nuclear tests.

“Deal Favours US farmers” Opposition Attacks India-US Trade Framework

NEW DELHI: Dubbing the India-US trade deal interim framework as a ""surrender"", Congress on Saturday said commerce minister Piyush Goyal's statement on agri imports was ""too clever by half"" as the joint statement mentions a list of products which India would eliminate or reduce tariffs upon, including ""additional products"".Congress MP Jairam Ramesh noted ""additional products"" were not specified, that the category was ""too open-ended and shows that something is being hidden"".

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi said on Saturday that the interim trade agreement with the US is yet more evidence of the international community's growing trust in India and said the series of recent trade deals marks country's transformation from just a huge market to a hub of investment and trade.While addressing a community event of persons of Indian origin in Kuala Lumpur, he said, ""Whether it is the UK, UAE, Australia, New Zealand, Oman, EU or US, countries have trade deals with India.

HAL Clarifies AMCA Status, Says It Will Bid For India's Fifth-Generation Fighter Jet In 2035 Phase

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","Hal has received five engines from ge as on date.

Signal to Islamabad

NEW DELHI: As New Delhi and Washington announced the framework for an interim trade agreement on Saturday, a map of India released by the US trade representative’s (USTR) office drew attention.The map, shared alongside details of the trade deal framework, shows the entire Jammu and Kashmir region – including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) – as part of India.It also depicts Aksai Chin, a region claimed by China, within Indian territory. China claims the territory and has objected to India’s position, a dispute that has remained a sensitive issue in bilateral ties between New Delhi and Beijing.In a post on X US trade representative said, “From tree nuts and dried distillers’ grains to red sorghum and fresh and processed fruit, the US-India Agreement will provide new market access for American products.While India has consistently maintained that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of the country and does not require external validation of its sovereignty, the depiction marks a departure from earlier US government maps, which typically showed the other claims as a part of the map.The timing of the map release is notable, coming as India and the US are moving to better the trade ties following months of speculation.Earlier this year, the Trump administration imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, including an additional 25% for Russian oil imports – the highest levied on a US ally – amid stalled trade negotiations. Under the interim framework announced, that tariff is set to be reduced to 18%, one of the lowest among Asian countries.Though the USTR did not comment on the map, it comes as an embarrassment for Pakistan, which claims PoK.The release also comes amid sustained diplomatic outreach by Pakistan to Washington in recent months, including multiple visits by Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif and army chief, Asim Munir, and meetings with President Trump.The interim trade pact, expected to be signed by mid-March, is aimed at easing trade tensions and providing relief to Indian exporters after months of uncertainty.","The map shows the entire jammu and kashmir region – including pakistan-occupied kashmir (pok) – as part of india.

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that Sangh is was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation and it does not seek power or popularity.While speaking at a program held as a part of the RSS centenary celebrations in Mumbai, Bhagwat said that those who want to know about RSS, must come should come within the organisation and observe it from close quarters.""The Sangh has not emerged in competition with any other institution or organization, nor as a reaction or in opposition to anyone. The Sangh does not seek popularity. The Sangh does not seek power. Whatever good deeds are being done in the country—may they be done well; the Sangh exists to help make that happen,"" RSS chief said.""If you want to know Sangh, come inside and see it for yourself,"" he added.Bhagwat claimed that more than one lakh thirty thousand small and big seva works re carried out by RSS volunteers across the country.""More than one lakh thirty thousand small and big seva works are carried out by Swayamsevaks without taking any government money, spending their own funds with the cooperation of society. In the history of our country, no Sangh like work occurred after Tathagat Buddha,"" He said.""The work of the Sangh is meant for the entire nation — Bharatvarsh,"" he added.Talking about the situation in the country that preceded the RSS's birth in 1925, Bhagwat the British founded the Indian National Congress as a “safety valve”, but the Indians transformed it into a powerful instrument in the struggle for independence.Referring to RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, Bhagwat described the difficult circumstances of his childhood including the death of both his parents due to the plague at age 13 and the financial hardship he suffered subsequently.Hedgewar actively participated in various movements during the freedom struggle, including the Vande Mataram agitation in his school days, Bhagwat said.When he cleared the matriculation examination with a first class, some people in Nagpur raised funds to send him to Calcutta (Kolkata) for medical education, where he came in contact with revolutionary groups, Bhagwat said.Recalling an anecdote from that period, Bhagwat said Hedgewar operated under the code name ""Koken"", inspired by the name of a person called Kokenchandra. Once a police team which had arrived to arrest Kokenchandra instead detained Hedgewar, an incident documented in a book by Rash Behari Bose, he said.During the ceremony, noted guests such as film actor Salman Khan , Subhash Ghai and Prasoon Joshi were also present.The two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons' seeks to reflect on the journey of RSS, its role in society, and the ideas and perspectives shaping its future.","Rashtriya swayamsevak sangh chief mohan bhagwat says sangh was not founded as reaction or in opposition to any organisation.

During his two-day visit to Malaysia, PM Modi interacted with and praised the Indian diaspora in Kuala Lumpur, highlighting strong cultural ties and the global significance of Tamil language and culture.

India and the US agreed on an interim trade framework reducing tariffs, expanding market access, and addressing multiple sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, and technology.

The US ended the extra 25% tariff on Indian imports, lowering tariffs from 50% to 18% as part of the interim trade framework.

Opposition leaders criticised the India-US trade deal, warning it could harm farmers, reduce tariffs excessively, and compromise India’s interests.

Police investigating the deaths of three minor sisters in UP's Ghaziabad say the case reveals a complex family situation, emotional distress, and isolation, with new details emerging about the father’s deceased live‑in partner.

From Tamil Pride To Global Trust: How PM Modi Used Culture To Reset India-Malaysia Relations

Ties in focus

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , while interacting with the Indian community in Kuala Lumpur, on Saturday, highlighted the deep cultural and emotional ties between India and Malaysia and praised the Indian diaspora for keeping traditions alive.The prime minister also called India a trusted partner for growth, referring to the recent deals with the United States and the European Union. “Trust has become India’s strongest currency,” the prime minister said.Hailing the cultural ties between the two nations, the prime minister said Malaysia has one of the largest Indian-origin populations in the world and played an important role in strengthening ties between the two countries. “Malaysia has the second-largest Indian-origin community in the world. There is so much that connects Indian and Malaysian hearts. You are a living bridge that links us,” Modi said.The Prime Minister also highlighted the global importance of Tamil. “Tamil is India’s link to the world, Tamil literature is eternal and Tamil culture is global,” he said. Notably, three are Tamil speakers in the country and the Malaysian government recognises it as a minority language.He recalled his friendship with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and appreciated his gesture during the visit. “Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I have been friends even before he became Prime Minister. Not just that, he came to the airport to welcome me and he brought me here in his car. This special gesture reflects his love and respect for India and for all of you,” he said.PM Modi also referred to cultural exchanges and appreciation for Indian music and cinema. “I’ve heard that Indian movies and music are popular in Malaysia.

Piyush Goyal Says Agriculture Is Self Reliant Sector As India Refuses Farm Import Benefits To US

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders on Saturday criticised the India-US Interim Trade Agreement framework, accusing the government of compromising India’s interests and raising concerns over its impact on farmers, tariffs, and oil imports.Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala warned that the agreement could harm farmers and rural livelihoods. He said, ""A blow has been delivered to the stomachs of India's 720 million farmers. Work has been done to snatch away the livelihood of India's 720 million food providers, farm labourers, and farmers.""He also raised concerns over agricultural imports from the US. ""US corn, US soybeans, US sorghum (jowar), US walnuts, almonds, pistachios, fresh fruits like apples and oranges, processed fruits, and other 'additional' agricultural products will all flood the Indian market,"" he said.Surjewala questioned the government on possible impacts. ""We are already importing $334 million worth of cotton from the US, which has caused cotton prices for Indian farmers to crash. Now, with corn, cotton, sorghum, fruits, processed fruits, and soybeans coming from the US, I ask PM Modi and Piyush Goyal: what will happen to India's farmers? Where will they go?"" he said.Congress leader Pawan Khera also attacked the government over the India-US Interim Trade Agreement, questioning what he called a shift in India’s diplomatic posture.""Where is the India which used to look Nixon, George Bush and Obama in the eye and forge practical relations?"" he asked.Khera alleged that the interests of ordinary Indians were being undermined, saying, ""This is not an agreement with the US, but a compromise with our self-respect."" He said those projecting the framework as a success were aware of its implications. ""This is not a deal, but a surrender,"" he said, adding that the opposition was being stopped from raising these issues in Parliament because the government feared scrutiny over the terms of the agreement.RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha also criticised the tariff changes and accused the government of misleading the public. ""On most things, our tariff, in the worst of times and the best of times, was 2.9%. Through threats, it was raised to 50%. Then it was reduced to 18%. Is this something to celebrate? Aren't you misleading the entire nation?"" he said.He warned that the deal could lead to public anger once its full impact is known.

India-US Trade Deal Explained: What The White House Says On Tariffs, Markets And Tech Shifts

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Jairam Ramesh on Saturday took a “Dost dost na raha” jibe at PM Modi , referring to his and US President Donald Trump’s friendship, after the recently announced India-US trade framework.Ramesh criticised the deal, saying it benefits American farmers at the expense of Indian ones and raised concerns over India’s agreement to stop importing oil from Russia, confirmed by the White House.In an X post, Ramesh said, ""Nothing in the recently released US-India joint statement has been made clear regarding the details. But from what has come to light so far, it’s evident that: India will no longer import oil from Russia. Separately, the US has also announced that if India buys oil from Russia, directly or indirectly, a 25 per cent penalty could be reimposed.""""To help American farmers at the expense of Indian farmers, India will slash import duties by a huge margin. India’s annual imports from the US will triple, wiping out our long-standing surplus in goods trade. Uncertainty will persist over India’s exports of IT and other services to the US.India’s goods exports will face higher duties in the US than before.”Ramesh added that the ""photo-ops"" did not amount to much benefits for India.“All those hugs and photo-ops have yielded no special results. Namaste Trump has come down heavily on Howdy Modi. Dost dost na raha,"" he added.The Congress leader’s criticism comes in response to the framework announced by India and the US for an Interim Agreement on trade. The framework reaffirms the countries’ commitment to broader Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) negotiations, launched by Donald Trump and PM Modi on February 13.These negotiations are expected to include additional market access commitments and support more resilient supply chains.As per the joint statement, the US will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 per cent on Indian-originating goods, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home decor, artisanal products, and certain machinery.The US will also remove tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts from India, previously imposed to address national security concerns.India, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a wide range of food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains (DDGs), red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.India also intends to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products, and coking coal over the next five years.","Congress mp jairam ramesh took a “dost dost na raha” jibe at pm modi after the recently announced india-us trade framework.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed the India-US interim trade agreement, calling it a major step towards strengthening economic ties, boosting domestic manufacturing and creating jobs.In a post on X, PM Modi said: ""Great news for India and USA! We have agreed on a framework for an Interim Trade Agreement between our two great nations. I thank President Trump for his personal commitment to robust ties between our countries.

It will generate large-scale employment for women and youngsters. India and the United States share a commitment to promoting innovation and this framework will further deepen investment and technology partnerships between us. This framework will also strengthen resilient and trusted supply chains and contribute to global growth. As India moves forward towards building a Viksit Bharat, we remain committed to building global partner"".India and the United States earlier released a joint statement announcing the framework for an interim trade agreement, under which tariffs on Indian goods entering the US will be reduced from 50% to 18%. ""The US and India are pleased to announce that they have reached a framework for an Interim Agreement regarding reciprocal and mutually beneficial trade,"" the statement said.The announcement follows months of negotiations after trade talks stalled when Washington imposed 50% tariffs on Indian imports. Of these, 25% duties were introduced in August, with the US alleging that India was supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine through oil purchases.The framework also reaffirms both sides’ commitment to negotiations on a broader US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement, launched by Modi and US President Donald Trump in February 2025 amid prolonged trade tensions linked to India’s energy imports from Russia.Under the interim deal, the United States will lower tariffs to 18% on a wide range of Indian products, including textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber goods, organic chemicals, home décor, artisanal products and select machinery. Subject to the successful conclusion of the agreement, Washington has also said it will remove tariffs on additional Indian exports such as generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.India, in turn, will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a broad basket of food and agricultural products, including dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits.Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said the agreement protects India’s agriculture sector, with sensitive farm and dairy products fully safeguarded. These include maize, wheat, rice, soya, poultry, milk, cheese, ethanol for fuel, tobacco, certain vegetables and meat.The framework also outlines India’s intent to purchase $500 billion worth of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years, a move expected to significantly expand bilateral trade.On claims that India would end Russian oil imports, New Delhi has not confirmed any such commitment. The government has reiterated that energy security remains its top priority. “Diversifying our energy sourcing in keeping with objective market conditions and evolving international dynamics is at the core of our strategy to ensure this,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The agreement provides for preferential market access for both countries in key sectors. The US will remove tariffs on certain Indian aircraft and aircraft parts imposed on national security grounds, while India will receive preferential tariff rate quotas for automotive parts and negotiated outcomes for generic pharmaceuticals and ingredients.Goyal said the pact opens up a $30 trillion market for Indian exporters, particularly MSMEs, farmers and fishermen, and is expected to create lakhs of jobs for women and youth.The framework also includes steps to boost digital and technology trade, with both sides committing to address barriers to digital commerce, increase trade in technology products including GPUs and data centre equipment, and expand joint technology cooperation.Both countries have agreed to work on removing non-tariff barriers affecting bilateral trade. India will address issues related to US medical devices, information and communication technology goods, and food and agricultural products, eliminate restrictive import licensing and review standards within six months to ease market access.Officials said the framework paves the way for finalising the interim agreement and advancing negotiations on a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement, with scope for further tariff reductions.","Pm modi calls india-us trade pact framework great news for jobs, make in india and exports.

What’s at stake when it comes to your plate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-at-stake-when-it-comes-to-your-plate/articleshow/127979060.cms,"Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres. Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece. ‘Would you like fries with that?’ The girl behind the counter asked the American standing before me at the McDonald’s outlet. He hesitated. A long hesitation for what should have been the simplest of decisions. Big Mac. Drink. Fries. Yes or no. I grew impatient. Why was his choice so difficult? Only later did it strike me that the difficulty did not lie in the fries. It lay in the burger itself. Vegetarian. Vegan . Flexitarian. A single patty had splintered into moral choices. In that moment, under fluorescent lights and digital menus, I realised that food , once a matter of hunger , had quietly become a matter of conscience. The World Economic Forum recently published data on changing global food habits. Vegetarianism, once considered marginal in the West, is steadily rising across Europe and the United States. Curiously, it is declining in large emerging economies such as India, where traditional diets are slowly yielding to speed, packaging and convenience. Among Gen Z in Europe, vegetarianism is being embraced with fresh intensity: protecting animals, reducing environmental strain. The logic is simple. Growing plants asks less of the earth than raising animals. Vegetables require less land, water and energy. Fewer forests are cleared, fewer resources extracted, fewer gases released. That is why a vegetarian diet produces nearly two and a half times less carbon emissions than a meat-based one. Eating vegetarian for a year can save emissions equal to removing a small family car from the road for six months. Yet the case for meat-eating carries its own dignity. Across history, meat has been nourishment in difficult climates, insurance against crop failure, and a compact source of strength where options were limited. For many communities even today, meat is not indulgence but woven into livelihoods and traditions. In this light, meat-eating is not moral neglect, but practical inheritance. But long before climate charts and sustainability panels, the Tamil land approached food through a softer instinct—not calculation, but empathy. Across the world today, vegetarianism is no longer eccentric. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs adopt plant-based diets for health and longevity. European govts encourage reduced meat consumption. What appears newly awakened is, in truth, deeply old. This is where Thiruvalluvar excels as a poet of compassion. Avisorinthu āayiram vēṭṭalin oṉdṟaṉ Uyirsegutthu uṇṇāamai naṉdṟu Better than a thousand burnt offerings Is One life un-killed, un-eaten . A thousand ritual fires may blaze, but they do not equal the quiet mercy of restraint. Tamil Sangam literature echoes this gentleness. Puranānūru speaks of ascetics as kollā nōṉbiṉar, those who have vowed not to kill. Akanānūru describes hospitality through rice, milk, curd, fruits, honey, and vegetables. Meat appears openly in most places; its absence elsewhere is deliberate. Vegetarian food is not portrayed as denial, but as choice shaped by feeling. Power too once learned restraint. Emperor Ashoka’s edicts from the third century BCE recorded reduced slaughter, protected animals, and banned killing on certain days. After Kalinga, remorse hardened into mercy, carved into stone. Valluvar reminds us that progress is not only about what we invent but about what we choose not to harm. It was the same voice that echoed in saint poet Vallalar’s verse: ‘I shed tears seeing plants that wither without water’. And somewhere between a burger choice and a spared life, the question remains quietly unanswered.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Iran Reaffirms 3000-Year Civilisational Bond With India, Says Chabahar Port 'Will Work Nicely'

NEW DELHI: Iran has backed the Chabahar port and cooperation with India amid the uncertainty looming over the project because of ongoing US efforts to isolate Iran, including the Trump administration's decision last year to revoke a sanctions waiver that allowed India to develop a terminal at the port.While Washington extended the waiver till April 26 after talks with the Indian side, there's little hope of another extension in the current circumstances. The Union Budget this year saw zero allocation for the port but govt has defended the decision saying it has already transferred the entire committed amount of $120 million to Iran. However, India has not backed out of the project or its commitment to extend a $250 million line of credit for further development of the port, according to a 10-year contract signed in 2024. This commitment is not time bound though.""The port of Chabahar is vital, and it can play a good role in accessing Afghanistan and central Asia. We have a good relationship with some countries, particularly India. I believe we should boost and expand our relations,"" said Iran's ambassador to India, Mohammad Fathali. ""Chabahar is Chabahar. The location is not going to change.
