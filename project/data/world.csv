Axiom-4’s science and outreach success





What’s next for him





How he’ll cope with Earth’s gravity

NEW DELHI: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla , the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station (ISS), is set to return to Earth on Tuesday, July 15, marking the end of an 18-day scientific mission aboard the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crewed flight.The Dragon spacecraft, carrying Shukla and fellow crew members Commander Peggy Whitson, ESA astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu, is scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday at 4:30 pm IST, with splashdown expected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California around 3:00 pm IST on Tuesday. The journey back is expected to last approximately 22 hours.The Ax-4 farewell ceremony was held aboard the ISS on Sunday evening, also attended by members of Nasa 's Expedition 73. Speaking at the event, Shukla reflected on his experience: “It almost seems magical to me... It has been a fantastic journey for me.” Channeling the iconic words of Rakesh Sharma, India’s first astronaut in space, he added, “Even today, Bharat looks 'saare jahan se accha' from above.”In Lucknow, anticipation is high. Shukla’s mother, Asha Shukla, told ANI, “We pray to God that he completes his mission successfully and comes back to Earth as soon as possible and meets us… We will give him a grand welcome.”His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, confirmed the flight timeline, saying, “We were waiting for this, so we are happy that he is coming back. We pray to God that he comes back safely.”Asha added that she is preparing all his favourite dishes: “He told us that this time, after coming back, he wants to eat everything he hasn't had in the past five-six years due to being abroad.”Before launch, Shukla had packed mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa for his time in space, saying, “There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa with me.”Launched on June 25 from Nasa ’s Kennedy Space Center aboard a Falcon-9 rocket, Axiom-4 docked with the ISS on June 26. Over 18 days, the team carried out more than 60 experiments, including studies on human health, space agriculture, mental well-being, and space suit materials. The mission will return with over 580 pounds of cargo, including scientific equipment and research samples.Shukla focused on testing glucose monitors in microgravity, contributing to efforts aimed at enabling diabetic individuals to participate in future space missions.In his final remarks from space, Shukla said, “I carry with me a lot of memories and learnings. But what stays with me most is what humanity can achieve when we all come together for a common goal.” He also thanked ISRO, Nasa , SpaceX, and Axiom Space, and acknowledged the contributions of Indian students and researchers to the mission’s outreach goals.After splashdown, Shukla and his crewmates will be transported to Nasa ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they will undergo post-landing protocols under medical supervision before being cleared for return to their home countries.He will undergo a series of medical and psychological evaluations, covering physical fitness, balance, reflexes, cardiovascular function, and immune response. Nasa ’s Human Health and Performance team will lead the assessments.Shukla will also be debriefed on his mission experience and the experiments he conducted. This data will aid both Axiom and ISRO as they plan future collaborative space missions. He is expected to be formally recognised by Indian scientific institutions, including ISRO and the Indian Air Force, and may receive honours from government bodies for his achievements in space exploration.After spending over two weeks in microgravity, Shukla’s body will need time to readjust to Earth’s gravity. Space travel leads to temporary loss of bone density and muscle mass, along with fluid redistribution that affects blood circulation and organ function.Nasa specialists note that astronauts often experience symptoms such as ""puffy face,"" ""chicken legs,"" vision changes, and even increased height during the early days in space. Upon return, rehabilitation protocols kick in. These include compression garments to stabilise blood pressure, hydration with salt tablets and water, and physical therapy to rebuild strength, coordination, and balance.According to Dr. Dervay from Nasa, “Almost every organ system in the body is impacted to some degree – whether it's the skin, the neurovestibular, the bone, muscle, the immunological system, the cardiovascular system.”However, Nasa says no extraordinary measures are needed in Shukla’s case. “We don’t see any need for any special precaution,” said Dina Contella, deputy manager of Nasa’s ISS Program. “Like any astronauts coming back, there is an acclimation period, and so that will vary by crew member.”Shukla’s recovery will also help space agencies better understand the impact of short-duration missions, crucial for long-term exploration goals such as missions to the Moon and Mars.A landmark mission for IndiaShukla’s mission is being seen as a symbolic and scientific milestone in India’s space journey. Coming ahead of ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission, it represents India’s growing presence in international space collaboration. At the farewell, Shukla noted, “If we decide, then even stars are attainable (taara api prapyante).”As he prepares to step back on Earth, Shukla brings not just research findings and experience, but a message of aspiration, unity, and national pride.(With inputs from agencies)","Shubhanshu shukla, the first indian astronaut to visit the international space station, is set to return to earth on july 15.

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI/MONTREAL: US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately issued notifications that fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.FAA's continued airworthiness notification on July 11 came after a preliminary report Friday into last month's Boeing 787-8 crash, which killed 260 people, raised questions over engine fuel cutoff switches. The notification to civil aviation authorities said: ""Although the fuel control switch design, including locking feature, is similar on various Boeing aeroplane models, the FAA does not consider this issue to be an unsafe condition that would warrant an airworthiness directive on any Boeing airplane models.

"Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha: I take full onus for Pahalgam, was a security failure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-i-take-full-onus-for-pahalgam-was-a-security-failure/articleshow/122426736.cms,"File photo: J&K LG Manoj Sinha (Picture credit: PTI)

LG Manoj Sinha, who completes five years at J&K Raj Bhavan, told TOI’s Bharti Jain that the Pahalgam terror attack was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. “The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide.

” “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”

Excerpts from the interview:

Has the Pahalgam attack shattered the myth that terrorism is on the wane in J&K?

There has been no attack in J&K since Operation Sindoor. Do you think this will hold?

Is local involvement in Pahalgam attack a worry for security agencies?

How has the Pahalgam incident impacted tourism in J&K?

What is the status on tourist destinations closed after Pahalgam attack?

What happened in Pahalgam was very unfortunate; innocent people were brutally killed. I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure. The common belief here has been that terrorists do not target tourists. The location where the attack took place is an open meadow. There is no facility or room for security forces to be present there.This was a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack. The arrests made by NIA in the case corroborate local involvement but it would still be wrong to conclude that the security environment in J&K stands completely vitiated. The attack was a debilitating and deliberate strike on the nation’s soul. The intention of the neighbour (Pakistan) was to create a communal divide and trigger a backlash against the people of J&K living in other parts of the country, adding to the feeling of alienation.Pakistan doesn’t want J&K to be peaceful and prosperous. In the past five years, the J&K economy’s size has doubled. Tourists have been flocking in high numbers. This (attack) was a hit by Pakistan at the economic well-being of Kashmir. But condemnation and protests by the people of Kashmir following the attack provided a befitting reply to Pakistan and terror outfits. They were clear signs that terrorism is not acceptable here anymore.Operation Sindoor has drawn red lines for Pakistan. India has made it clear that any terror attack will be considered an act of war. The manner in which our forces carried out precise hits against terror facilities in Pakistan, and when it tried to target our military and civilian assets, how they destroyed their airbases, conveyed a stern message to Pakistan. Still, a country that has made terrorism its declared state policy, is not to be trusted. I am confident that the home ministry, defence ministry and our intelligence agencies are keeping a watch on Pakistan. But it is a fact that there has been no terror attack in J&K after Operation Sindoor.Local terror recruitment is at an all-time low. There has been just one incident of local recruitment this year as compared to 6 to 7 last year; there was a time when this figure used to be 150-200. But it is also a fact that Pakistan has facilitated the infiltration of a large number of terrorists in both Jammu region and Kashmir region.Tourist arrivals had almost stopped after the Pahalgam incident. We believed that the Amarnath yatra would be turning point.We have already opened many. Others will be opened too in a phased manner. This is being done after finalising a robust security plan for each one of them.","Lg manoj sinha says the pahalgam terror attack was a pakistan-sponsored terror attack. “the intention of the neighbour (pakistan) was to create a communal divide. ” “i take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122426796,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-934038,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Closer': Donald Trump's Big Hint On India-US Trade Deal Amid High Tariff Slapped On Other Nations

India, US near trade deal. What happens next if New Delhi joins Trump’s shortlist?



United States is working toward an interim trade agreement with India that could reduce proposed tariffs to below 20%. This would give India a more favourable position compared to other countries in the region.Unlike many nations, India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement, Bloomberg reported, quoting sources.The proposed interim trade deal between the two nations would allow both the sides to continue negotiations, giving India time to address unresolved issues before a broader agreement expected later this year, the source added.The planned agreement is likely to set a baseline tariff of under 20%, down from the 26% initially proposed, with provisions to allow further adjustments as part of a final pact. However, the exact timeline for the interim deal remains uncertain.If finalised, India would likely join a select group of nations that have reached trade arrangements with the Trump administration. In contrast, several other countries were hit with surprise tariff hikes of up to 50% this week, ahead of the August 1 deadline.India is pushing for a more favourable deal than the one signed with Vietnam, which included 20% tariffs. Vietnam, caught off guard by the high rate, is now seeking a revision. So far, only the UK has officially signed trade deals with the Trump administration.Earlier on Thursday, Trump told NBC News that he is considering imposing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven't yet received specific rates.Currently, the baseline tariff for most US trade partners stands at 10%. For Asian countries, announced rates so far include 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines, and as high as 40% for Laos and Myanmar.Despite being among the earliest to initiate trade discussions this year, India-US relations have shown recent tensions.While Trump indicates an imminent agreement, he has also suggested additional tariffs regarding India's BRICS membership.An Indian negotiation team is expected to visit Washington soon to push forward trade talks. India has already made its final offer to the Trump administration and outlined its non-negotiable positions.The key sticking points remain, including the US demand for India to allow genetically modified (GM) crops, something New Delhi has firmly opposed, citing concerns for farmers. Other unresolved issues include non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory challenges in the pharmaceutical sector.","India is not expected to receive a formal tariff hike notice this week, and the agreement may be announced through an official statement.

A small plane crashed at London Southend Airport on Sunday. The airport, located about 72 kilometers east of London, confirmed on social media that there had been a ""serious incident"" involving a general aviation aircraft.Essex Police said they were alerted just before 4 pm local time and described it as a ""serious incident."" They added, as cited by the news agency Associated Press, ""We are working with all emergency services at the scene now and that work will be ongoing for several hours.""British media reported that the aircraft was a medical transport jet, a Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, equipped with systems designed for patient transport and en route to the Netherlands.Photos shared on social media showed fire and thick black smoke rising from the crash site. The aircraft involved in the incident is said to be 12 meters long.Witness John Johnson, who was at the airport with his family, said he saw a “big fireball” after the plane “crashed head first into the ground.” “It took off and about three or four seconds after taking off, it started to bank heavily to its left, and then within a few seconds of that happening, it more or less inverted and crashed just head-first into the ground,"" he said, as quoted by AP.“There was a big fireball"", he added.Johnson also recalled that before the crash, he and his family had waved at the pilots. “They all waved back at us,” he said, adding that the airport’s fire service responded immediately with two fire engines, followed by local police, ambulance and fire services.Details about how many people were on board or where the plane was going have not yet been shared.As a safety measure, police evacuated a nearby golf club and rugby club because of their closeness to the crash site.Local MP David Burton-Sampson urged people to avoid the area and allow emergency services to operate. “My thoughts are with everyone involved,” he said.According to the airport’s website, all flights to and from the airport have been cancelled until further notice","Small plane crashed at london southend airport on sunday.

Aviation Expert Links Mid-Air Fuel Cut-Off to AI171 Crash After AAIB Preliminary Report

Until final report is out, any speculation unacceptable: Union

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A day after Airline Pilots' Association of India said Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary report on the Air India 171 crash led to the promoting of a ""presumption of pilot guilt"" even before the probe was complete, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA), one of the Air India pilots' unions, on Sunday slammed the ""reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide"" that has been doing the rounds since the report was made public on Saturday.AAIB had stated that both fuel switches on the Boeing 787 transitioned from ""run"" to ""cut-off"" three seconds after it took off from the runway, cutting off fuel supply to the engines. ""In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other, 'Why did you cut off (the fuel supply)?' The other responded he did not do so,"" according to the report. However, it didn't elucidate why the fuel control switches were cut off.Soon after the report's release, pilots and aviation experts, in interviews and posts on social media, claimed one of the pilots had knowingly cut off the fuel supply switch.The pilots of AI 171, which crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions, ICPA, one of the AI pilots’ unions, said, adding the crew should not be vilified based on conjecture.Referring to a 2018 safety bulletin issued by the US aviation regulator that instructed airlines to look out for a possible mechanical fault with the fuel control switches — which could cut off fuel supply to the engines without pilot input — the report said that Air India did not carry out the inspection as it was not deemed mandatory.“In the aftermath of this incident, we are deeply disturbed by speculative narratives emerging in sections of the media and public discourse — particularly the reckless and unfounded insinuation of pilot suicide. Let us be unequivocally clear: there is absolutely no basis for such a claim at this stage, and invoking such a serious allegation based on incomplete or preliminary information is not only irresponsible — it is deeply insensitive to the individuals and families involved,” said ICPA.“Pilots undergo extensive psychological and professional screening, recurrent training, and operate under the highest standards of safety, responsibility, and mental fitness. To casually suggest pilot suicide in the absence of verified evidence is a gross violation of ethical reporting and a disservice to the dignity of the profession,” it added.“As aviation professionals, we trust and respect the rigorous investigative protocols established by competent authorities. These inquiries are designed to uncover facts methodically and without bias. Until the official investigation is concluded and the final report is published, any speculation — especially of such a grave nature — is unacceptable and must be condemned,” ICPA said, calling on media and public commentators to act with restraint, empathy, and respect for due process.","The pilots of ai 171, which crashed in ahmedabad on june 12 killing 270 people, acted in line with their training and responsibilities under challenging conditions.

NEW DELHI: The issue of the Dalai Lama’s succession is a thorn in China-India relations, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi said on Sunday. The statement comes days before external affairs minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to visit China for the first time since the 2020 border clashes.Ahead of the Tibetan spiritual leader’s 90th birthday celebrations this month, the Dalai Lama said China has no role in deciding his successor. Tibetans believe that the soul of a senior monk is reborn after death, but China insists its leaders must approve the succession.Yu Jing, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy, posted on X that ""some people from strategic and academic communities in India"" had made, what she called ""improper remarks"" on the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. She did not name anyone.""As professionals in foreign affairs, they should be fully cognizant of the sensitivity of issues related to Xizang,"" Yu said, using the Chinese term for Tibet ""The reincarnation and succession of the Dalai Lama is inherently an internal affair of China,"" she added.""(The) Xizang-related issue is a thorn in China-India relations and has become a burden for India. Playing the ‘Xizang card’ will definitely end up shooting oneself in the foot.""Minister of parliamentary and minority affairs Kiren Rijiju, who sat next to the Dalai Lama during the birthday event, said, ""The Dalai Lama is a defining spiritual leader for Buddhists,” adding, “The decision about his reincarnation should follow tradition and be made by him alone.

GUWAHATI: Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I, the banned anti-talks faction of the original militant outfit of the same name that he co-founded in 1979, claimed Sunday that three of its senior members were killed in targeted pre-dawn drone attacks by the Indian Army on some ""mobile camps"" in Myanmar's Sagaing region.The Army officially denied carrying out any such aerial attacks on the camps purportedly shared by Ulfa-I and Manipur's Revolutionary People's Front (RPF) across a stretch of the India-Myanmar border, adjoining Longwa in Nagaland and Pangsau Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.Ulfa-I said the attacks came in waves between 2 am and 4 am - involving over 150 drones of Israeli and French make - and resulted in the outfit losing insurgent veterans Nayan Asom, Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom. The last two were killed in the second drone strike while attending Nayan's funeral, while 19 members were wounded, the outfit said.""There are no inputs with the Indian Army on such an operation,"" defence ministry PRO Lt Col Mahendra Rawat told TOI in Guwahati.Ulfa-I contested the statement, specifying that three drone attacks took place in the span of two hours.

They said there could be clarity on Ulfa-I's claim as more information arrives from the remote border.A source in the security establishment confirmed casualties in the Ulfa-I camps in Myanmar, suggesting the attacks could be the outcome of the civil war in that country with several ethnic armed groups at heart of the strife."" The ongoing civil war there has led to frequent clashes, shifting alliances and a general breakdown of state control in many areas, particularly near the international border,"" the source said. ""In this environment, attacks on insurgent camps - including those used by Ulfa-I - could plausibly originate from Myanmar's own ethnic armed organisations, or even the Myanmar military, rather than by Indian forces.""Insurgent outfits of the Northeast have had a presence in Myanmar since the late Eighties, taking advantage of the porous border and ongoing conflict there.Indian security agencies have repeatedly expressed concern over the use of Myanmarese territory by militants for hit-and-run attacks in the Northeast.

Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to Know

NAGPUR: The jalebi might soon come with a guilt trip. The samosa, a side of shame. And your chai biscuit? A health warning on the wall behind it.The health ministry has ordered all central institutions, including AIIMS Nagpur, to install ""oil and sugar boards"" - vivid posters spelling out how much hidden fat and sugar lurk in everyday snacks. It's a first step toward treating junk food like tobacco.The boards aim to act as quiet but pointed reminders in govt institutions, alerting citizens to the sugar and oil content in snacks considered cultural staples. A laddoo, a vada pav, a pakora - all under scrutiny. AIIMS Nagpur officials confirmed the directive. Cafeterias and public areas will soon display the warnings. ""It's the beginning of food labelling becoming as serious as cigarette warnings,"" said Amar Amale, president of Cardiological Society of India's Nagpur chapter. ""Sugar and trans fats are the new tobacco. People deserve to know what they're eating.""Govt's internal note draws a sharp line under the country's growing obesity crisis. More than 44.9 crore Indians are projected to be overweight or obese by 2050 - placing the country second only to the US. Already, one in five urban adults is overweight. The rise in childhood obesity, driven by poor diet and low activity, deepens the concern.""This is not about banning food,"" said senior diabetologist Sunil Gupta. ""But if people knew that one gulab jamun might contain five teaspoons of sugar, they might think twice before going for seconds."" Doctors and health advocates see this as part of the broader war on non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, many of which are linked to diet.Nagpur will be among the first to reflect that shift - not with bans, but with bold, visual nudges.

NEW DELHI: In a special message read out at a day-long conference organised here to mark his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama said ""we Tibet ans"" are deeply indebted to the govt and people of India for the warm hospitality they have shown since 1959, even as he indirectly questioned China's claim over Tibet.The Tibetan spiritual leader recalled how it had been more than 66 years since a large number of Tibetans, including him, fled to India following the ""Chinese Communist invasion of Tibet"".Referring to India as ""Arya Bhumi"" in his written message read out at the conference by his confidant and noted scholar Samdhong Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama said that ""here (India) I have enjoyed the freedom and opportunity to continue my studies of ancient Indian wisdom"". He felt a ""special closeness"" to India, which, over and above being the world's most populous country and the largest democracy, is the land of the Buddha, the place where he attained enlightenment, he added.Reflecting on the profound impact the 14th Dalai Lama has had on the world, a declaration adopted at the conference organised by International Buddhist Confederation and attended by nearly 500 participants, including renowned Buddhist monks and scholars, hailed him for having consistently championed the preservation of the rich Tibetan culture and religious freedom.""His (Dalai Lama) recent statement announcing the continuation of his reincarnation, and only by Tibetan people without any foreign interference is a testament of preserving its culture and heritage,"" the declaration stated. ""His wisdom in safeguarding the sacred institution of the Dalai Lama - particularly his clear and courageous stance on its future - stands as a beacon of spiritual integrity in the modern world,"" it said.In his message, the Dalai Lama added, ""I believe that if aspects of India's ancient wisdom, of which the Buddha's teachings are a part, are combined with modern education they can make a beneficial contribution to greater peace and happiness in the world"".Recalling that soon after ""we Tibetans"" came to India, the Dalai Lama said the Indian govt actively supported establishment of schools for Tibetan children to receive modern education while also learning about Tibetan culture and traditions.","The tibetan spiritual leader recalled how it had been more than 66 years since a large number of tibetans, including him, fled to india following the ""chinese communist invasion of tibet"" the dalai lama said that ""here (india) i have enjoyed the freedom and opportunity to continue my studies of ancient indian wisdom""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122425696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1145638,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Absolutely Not necessary

MUMBAI: Pilots have expressed their concerns about the the AAIB report. Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, commented: “At what stage did the engines actually stop producing thrust? The AI 171 Preliminary Report says: ‘After 08:08:42 UTC when Fuel Control Switches were moved to CUT OFF.But in a later paragraph, the report stated the RAT (ram air turbine) was already deployed immediately after take-off. A simple report consisting of the collated data to date would have served the purpose of a preliminary report. This report has raised questions and suspicion about the intent of AAIB.”Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA-I), said: “The conversation between the pilots enquiring who cut off the fuel control switch is alarming. Another issue is, why did the emergency locator transmitter not work after the accident? “AAIB report carries no official signature, investigations continue to be shrouded in secrecy, undermining credibility and public trust.Qualified, experienced line pilots are still not being included in the investigation team. ALPA-I renews its request to be included — at the very least as observers — in the investigation to ensure transparency and accountability,” he added.Capt Mohan Ranganthan, a former Boeing 737 commander and instructor, claimed: “The pilot cut off the fuel knowingly. The left engine failed several seconds after the right engine, indicating that fuel control switches were cut off one after the other. The AAIB report has a lot of ambiguity.”A senior Boeing commander, requesting anonymity, said: “The argument that since Boeing has not issued an advisory it indicates the pilot moved the fuel to the cut-off position is flawed. Lack of advisory does not confirm system safety. Several aircraft design flaws were acknowledged only after multiple incidents, history has shown.“We know how pilots were the first to be blamed after the Lion Air crash involving a Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2018.”",Pilots have expressed their concerns about the the aaib report.

NEW DELHI: The Tibet-related issue is a thorn in the China-India relationship, becoming a burden for India, and playing the ""Xizang card"" will definitely ""end up shooting oneself in the foot"", said the Chinese embassy spokesperson here taking note of recent remarks by members of the Indian strategic and academic communities.China had earlier formally registered a protest with India over PM Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and remarks by Union minister Kiren Rijiju that the Tibetan spiritual leader's successor would be decided by his Trust alone. Rijiju had later clarified that he had not spoken on behalf of the Indian government.Spokesperson Yu Jing said on X the Indian government has made political commitments to China, recognising that Xizang Autonomous Region is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and that India does not allow Tibetans to engage in political activities against China in India.The controversy over the Dalai Lama's announcement that China will have no role in his reincarnation has erupted at a time both countries are engaged in efforts to normalise the relationship after a protracted military standoff. External affairs minister S Jaishankar is expected to arrive in China Monday for his first visit there in six years. While a final decision is still awaited, government is also considering a visit by PM Narendra Modi to China in Sept for the SCO summit.Modi had last visited China in 2018.""...some people from strategic and academic communities, including ex-officials, made some improper remarks on the reincarnation of Dalai Lama, contrary to Indian government's public stance,"" said Yu, adding they should be cognizant of the sensitivity of the issues.","Tibet-related issue is a thorn in the china-india relationship, becoming a burden for india.

NEW DELHI: India and Saudi Arabia witnessed the signing of long-term agreements between leading Sauidi mining company Ma'aden and Indian companies, IPL, KRIBHCO and CIL, for supply of 3.1 million MT of DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertiliser per annum for five years, with likely extension of another five years with mutual consent.The agreements were signed during Union minister for fertilisers and chemicals J P Nadda's ongoing ""landmark"" visit to Saudi Arabia.Indian officials said this represents a substantial increase in the availability of the crucial DAP fertiliser, ensuring the goal of food security in the medium to long term. China is one of the countries India has been dependent on for DAP supplies, and the govt is looking to reduce its reliance on the country for what is the most used fertiliser in India after urea.Without naming China, a source said that at a time when some countries are showing a restrictive approach in fertiliser supply, the commitment from Riyadh demonstrates that India's friends and partners continue to work closely to deliver requirements and collaborate on future investments.Indian officials said Nadda's visit provided a further impetus to the expanding strategic partnership with Saudi, following the State Visit of PM Modi to Jeddah in April.""Both sides underscored their commitment to broadening the scope of bilateral relations to include other key fertilisers such as urea along with DAP, aiming to ensure India's fertiliser security.

These remarks are irresponsible and regrettable and do not behove the state authority,” said MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. “Government of India disassociates itself from such unwarranted comments that undermine India’s ties with friendly countries,” he added.The response came shortly after Mann made a series of sarcastic remarks to the media, questioning the relevance of the Prime Minister’s visit to countries such as Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil and Namibia.

In Ghana, Modi was conferred the “Officer of the Order of the Star of Ghana,” while in Trinidad and Tobago — the first visit by an Indian PM in over two decades — he addressed Parliament and was honoured with the “Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. ”PM Modi’s visit to Argentina was the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 57 years. Talks centred on critical minerals, energy, and digital platforms. Argentina expressed interest in adopting India’s UPI system. In Brazil, Modi attended the BRICS Summit and received the “Grand Collar of the National Order of the Southern Cross.” Namibia became the first country to adopt India’s UPI platform and awarded PM Modi the “Order of the Most Ancient Welwitschia Mirabilis. ”","The ministry of external affairs (mea) on thursday condemned remarks made by punjab chief minister bhagwant mann regarding prime minister narendra modi’s recent five-nation tour.

Singer and entrepreneur Ciara is stepping into a bold new chapter as her husband, NFL quarterback Russell Wilson, begins his journey with the New York Giants. The power couple has officially made the move to New York City, a transition that’s already making headlines in both the entertainment and sports worlds. As Wilson prepares to lead the Giants, Ciara is embracing the city’s pace, energy, and culture with her signature flair. The family’s high-profile relocation marks one of the most talked-about shifts of the NFL offseason.During a recent appearance on the Today show, Ciara shared personal insights into the family’s relocation and how they’re adjusting to life in New York City. “You know, I mean, it’s like in my genes, you know, it’s in my DNA, you know, it’s what I do,” Ciara said with a laugh. “No, but New York is awesome. It’s so much culture, so much fun, so much diversity.” According to the Grammy winner, the family's transition has been smooth — especially for the kids.One of the standout moments from their move was courtesy of her daughter Sienna, who showed off her own version of New York style. “I was packing the bags for the first trip here. And she put out this really shiny, bright pink suit,” Ciara recalled with a smile. “And I’m like, ‘Sienna, that’s doing too much.’ And she’s like, ‘Mom, we’re going to New York.’” That moment, Ciara said, captured the family's excitement and mindset as they take on a new city.Ciara also revealed that this move holds special significance given her personal ties to the city through family. “My dad’s actually from New York. My dad’s whole side is from New York as well. New York’s in our blood,” she shared proudly. Though she’s lived in multiple cities throughout her career and Wilson’s NFL journey, New York represents something more permanent and generational for the singer.Beyond the glitz of New York life, Ciara is most thrilled about the educational and cultural opportunities her children will experience. “I’m excited for my kids to go to school in New York. It’s going to be our first time for them,” she said. The family, known for sharing glimpses of their life on social media, has already started documenting their Big Apple adventures.

Prayers and preparations

How

Ax-4 crew will return

NEW DELHI: It’s been more than 15 days since Shubhanshu Shukla, the first Indian astronaut to visit the International Space Station, left Earth for his mission aboard Axiom-4. His mother, like all mothers, is counting the hours until her child returns home.If all goes as planned, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will fly back to Earth on Tuesday. The Dragon spacecraft is scheduled to undock from the ISS on Monday and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast the next day.Speaking to ANI from Lucknow, his mother, Asha Shukla, who grew emotional at the time of lift-off as she watched the historic moment unfold, said the family was preparing to welcome him home. “We pray to God that he completes his mission successfully and comes back to earth as soon as possible and meets us… We will give him a grand welcome,” she said.His father, Shambhu Dayal Shukla, said, “Tomorrow, July 14, the undocking will take place at around 4.30 pm, and on July 15, he will return to Earth. We were waiting for this, so we are happy that he is coming back. We pray to God that he comes back safely.”Earlier, Asha had said the thought of having him back at home brought relief and happiness.""He showed us the view of Earth from space. Seeing him smiling and healthy meant a lot to us. We are just waiting for him to be back safely so that he can relax and eat at home with us,"" she added.Asked what preparations were being done for his welcome, Shubhanshu's mother, Asha, said, ""I will cook whatever he wants. He told us that this time, after coming back, he wants to eat everything he hasn't had in the past five-six years due to being abroad. He said he wants to enjoy all his favourite home-cooked food.""Shubhanshu had said he would miss home food during the mission, so he packed a few Indian sweets for the journey. Speaking at a press conference before the launch, he shared, “There will be plenty of food to eat in space, but I will be carrying mango nectar, carrot halwa, and moong dal halwa with me.”Shukla, an Indian Air Force officer, part of the Axiom Mission 4 crew, will return with Commander Peggy Whitson, ESA astronaut Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski of Poland, and Hungarian astronaut Tibor Kapu.Their return journey will take around 22 hours. The crew is expected to splash down at approximately 3 pm IST on Tuesday.A farewell ceremony with Nasa ’s Expedition 73 crew is scheduled at 7:25 pm IST on 14 July.According to Axiom Space, the mission will return with over 580 pounds of cargo, including equipment and research samples from more than 60 experiments.During their 18-day stay aboard the ISS, the Ax-4 team carried out several scientific studies and outreach activities. These included tests related to human health, space agriculture, mental well-being, and space suit materials. Group Captain Shukla worked on a project to test glucose monitors in microgravity—part of a broader effort to enabling diabetic individuals to participate in spaceflight.Axiom Mission 4 was launched on 25 June from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. The Dragon spacecraft docked with the ISS on 26 June.","Shubhanshu shukla, the first indian astronaut to visit the international space station, will return to earth on tuesday.

Mexican tariff proposal below Canadian rate



Fentanyl to fix trade and toxins



US President Donald Trump has sent letters to 23 trading partners this week, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, and others — threatening blanket import tariffs ranging from 20% to 50%. The move, part of a renewed aggressive trade stance, also includes a 50% duty on copper imports.The letters outline that the proposed 30% general tariff would be in addition to existing levies — such as 50% on steel and aluminum and 25% on autos, which will remain in place. Countries have until August 1 to negotiate individual trade deals to avoid the hikes.This marks a return to Trump’s hardline approach seen earlier this year, when a similar round of tariff announcements jolted global markets before being postponed.Earlier on Saturday, Trump warned he would impose a 30% tariff on imports from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1, after trade talks with both sides failed to reach a full agreement.The announcement, shared through letters posted on Trump’s Truth Social account, marks a sharp escalation in trade tensions. It has alarmed US allies and shaken investor confidence.Despite global pushback, Trump appears undeterred, buoyed by a strong US economy and record stock market highs.In his letter to the European Commission, Trump demanded that the EU remove all tariffs on US goods, claiming the bloc must help reduce America’s trade deficit.Both the EU and Mexico, key US trade partners, condemned the proposed tariffs as unfair and disruptive. Despite the warning, they expressed willingness to continue negotiations in hopes of reaching a broader deal before the deadline.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she remained confident that an agreement could still be finalised. ""I've always said that in these cases, what you have to do is keep a cool head to face any problem,"" Sheinbaum said.""We're also clear on what we can work with the United States government on, and we're clear on what we can't. And there's something that's never negotiable: the sovereignty of our country,"" she added.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that, ""The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,"" he wrote.She also warned that the 30% tariffs ""would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.""Trump has so far only reached framework trade deals with a few countries like the UK, China, and Vietnam. Talks with other major partners remain ongoing.The proposed tariff rate for Mexico is less than Canada's 35%, with both nations' correspondence mentioning fentanyl trafficking, despite official statistics indicating substantially higher seizures at the Mexican frontier compared to the Canadian border, according to Reuters.""Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough. Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,"" Trump wrote.China remains the primary supplier of precursor chemicals for fentanyl production.According to US authorities, just 0.2% of all fentanyl seized in the country comes through the Canadian border, with the overwhelming majority smuggled in from Mexico via the southern border.Mexico, which sends over 80% of its exports to the US , became America’s top trading partner in 2023, largely driven by free trade between the two nations.Meanwhile, the European Union had initially aimed for a full-scale trade deal with the US but has since dialed back its ambitions. It is now pursuing a more flexible framework agreement, similar to the one struck with the UK, leaving finer details to be worked out over time.The EU faces internal tensions as Germany advocates for swift agreement to protect its industrial interests, whilst other members, including France, advise against accepting unfavourable US terms.Bernd Lange, who leads the European Parliament's trade committee, advised Brussels to implement counter-measures immediately. ""This is a slap in the face for the negotiations. This is no way to deal with a key trading partner,"" Lange told Reuters.Trump's recent tariff directives have generated substantial revenue, with US customs duties exceeding $100 billion in the fiscal year through to June, according to US Treasury figures. These measures have affected diplomatic relations with close US allies.","Eu and mexico condemn proposed tariffs as unfair and disruptive.

Vanessa Bryant quietly amplifies Mexican rescue efforts as Texas flood death toll climbs past 129 victims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/vanessa-bryant-quietly-amplifies-mexican-rescue-efforts-as-texas-flood-death-toll-climbs-past-129-victims/articleshow/122422781.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Vanessa Bryant’s quiet Instagram nod spotlights international rescue

Vanessa Bryant showed that she didn't need a press release or a long caption to make a statement. After the terrible floods in Texas, she shared a tribute to the Mexican rescue teams—only adding a heart. With the state dealing with 129 deaths, 170 missing individuals, and $22 billion in damages, her minimalistic response stood out amidst the chaos, emphasizing how grief, empathy, and global kindness can all come together in one quiet message.In early July, Central Texas went through an extraordinary level of destruction when flash floods struck the Hill Country over the Independence Day weekend. Torrential rain—reaching 32 inches in certain areas—caused the Guadalupe River to rise nearly 26 feet in under an hour, flooding cabins and neighborhoods. The most affected area, Kerr County—including the beloved Camp Mystic—lost 27 campers and counselors, while recovery efforts across the state confirm at least 129 fatalities, with about 170 people still unaccounted for.The Mexican rescue teams were instrumental in the response efforts. Firefighters from Acuña, Mexico, sent by Fundación 911, showed up in Kerr County to lend a hand to local crews dealing with the wreckage.They contributed to saving lives and delivering necessary assistance amidst the chaos.Vanessa Bryant’s journey has been filled with deep personal loss that became public due to tragedy. In 2020, she faced the heartbreaking loss of her husband Kobe and daughter Gianna, channeling her sorrow into action through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation and her wider charitable legacy. In January, her foundation gave away over 8,000 pieces of clothing to families affected by wildfires in Los Angeles. Therefore, when she shared the highlight of the Mexican rescue with just a heart emoji, it was not just a simple gesture — it was a meaningful acknowledgment of humanitarian bravery and togetherness.Numerous celebrities have come together to support Texas—Matthew McConaughey, Hilary Duff, Shakira, and the NBA community have all pledged their backing and contributed millions. Yet, it’s Bryant’s cross-cultural acknowledgment that truly stands out, highlighting that empathy goes beyond borders.Also Read: Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry shocks himself with accidental wedgie shot at celebrity golf event The whole point of the message by Bryant is that solidarity of opportunities is not necessarily loud. During the times of great tragedies, silent solidarity proclaims an understanding, helps to raise awareness, and show flooding-stricken families they are not alone.","Vanessa bryant shared a tribute to the mexican rescue teams in texas.
