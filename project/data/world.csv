'Shame': Trump trade adviser's fresh attack on India after RIC huddle at SCO; takes jibe at PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shame-trump-trade-advisors-fresh-attack-on-india-after-ric-huddle-at-sco-takes-jibe-at-pm-modi/articleshow/123646265.cms,"Peter Navarro





NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.While talking to reporters, Navarro said that PM Modi needs to step up and be with Europe and Ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from Russia.""""The road to peace in many ways runs at least partly through New Delhi. It's time for Modi to step up. I have great respect for Modi. I love the Indian people. It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, Putin and Xi Jinping,"" Navarro said.""So we hope that the Indian leader comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us in Europe and Ukraine and not with Russia on this, and he needs to stop buying the oil,"" he added.This comes a day after the White House trade counselor ignited a firestorm in the ongoing US-India trade spat, alleging, in reference to India selling refined Russian oil to the West, that ""Brahmins are profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.""""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.Navarro has made multiple jabs at India as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with Russia. These included calling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war,"" branding India ""Kremlin's laundromat,"" and accusing New Delhi of fueling the Ukraine war for profit.The Trump administration, earlier this month, ramped up attacks on India for buying Russian oil, with Navarro characterizing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" and cautioning New Delhi about getting close to Beijing and Moscow.""India, you're the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies. (Instead) you're getting in bed with the authoritarians,"" Navarro had said, just hours after 50% tariffs on India went into effect.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.Following this, the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on Speaker Mike Johnson to put on the floor US Representative Gregory Meeks' resolution to terminate Trump's ""national emergency"" declaration, which he used to impose the massive tariffs.Quoting Meeks in a social media post, it also called for the Speaker to ""stop covering for Trump’s lawlessness.""","Peter navarro said that pm modi needs to step up and be with europe and ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from russia"" navarro has made multiple jabs at india as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with russia.

NEW DELHI: India joined other SCO member states in strongly condemning in the Tianjin Declaration the military strikes by Israel and the US on Iran, a member of the Eurasian group, in June this year. SCO had in June too condemned Israel's military strikes on Iran in a joint statement, but India had then refused to associate itself from it saying the Indian govt wasn't a part of the discussions that preceded the condemnation.The Tianjin Declaration said such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including nuclear energy infrastructure, which resulted in the death of civilians, are a gross violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter, and an infringement of Iran's sovereignty.""They undermine regional and international security and have serious implications for global peace and stability,"" it said. The Declaration also noted that the physical nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities must be ensured on a permanent basis, including during periods of armed conflict, in order to protect the population and the environment from harm.Reiterating their ""deep concern"" over the continuing escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the member states also strongly condemned the actions that have led to numerous casualties among the civilian population and a catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.""They stress the need to ensure an immediate, complete and sustainable ceasefire, access to humanitarian aid, and intensified efforts to achieve peace, stability and security for all residents of the region,"" it said.India had in June also abstained from voting on a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Its decision to distance itself from the SCO condemnation of Israel then was seen as another show of solidarity with Israel. The fact that Pakistan, a traditional foe, is also a member of SCO was also seen as a likely factor in India's decision at the time.""Member states note that the only possible way to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East is through a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian question,"" said the Declaration.",India joins sco nations in condemning israel & u.s. in tianjin declaration.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","Us federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president donald trump under emergency powers were illegal.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday concluded his two-day visit to China where he attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit and held bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin Against the backdrop of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, the visit sends a stern message to Washington highlighting strong ties with Russia and China.""Concluding a productive visit to China, where I attended the SCO Summit and interacted with various world leaders. Also emphasised India’s stand on key global issues.

China and India are two of the most civilisational countries.”“We are the world's two most populous countries and part of the Global South... It is vital to be friends, a good neighbour, and the Dragon and the Elephant to come together,” he added.PM Modi, on the second day of his visit, shared warm moments with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as they met on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit 2025 in Tianjin.

But terrorism, separatism and extremism are big challenges in this path. Terrorism is not just a challenge to the security of a country but a common challenge for all of humanity.""""We have to say clearly and unanimously that no double standards are acceptable on terrorism,"" he added.""This attack was an open challenge to every country and person who believes in humanity. In such a situation, it is natural to raise the question of whether the open support of terrorism by some countries can be acceptable to us. We have to unanimously oppose terrorism in every form and colour. This is our duty towards humanity,” the Prime Minister further said.PM Modi also took a veiled jibe at China's Belt and Road Initiative as he said that connectivity loses its trust and meaning if it bypasses sovereignty.While speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in China's Tianjin, PM Modi pointed to the SCO Charter and said that connectivity should always respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday addressed the plenary session at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin and called for a united global fight against terrorism.

Connectivity that bypasses sovereignty loses trust and meaning,"" PM Modi said.""India firmly believes that strong connectivity ensures not just trade, but also trust and development. That is why we are working on Chabahar and the International North-South Economic Corridor, which will enhance connectivity to Afghanistan and Central Asia,"" he added.SCO member states ""strongly condemned"" the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, expressing their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.""The Member States strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the dead and the wounded. They further stated that perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice,"" the declaration read.The declaration emphasised that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice.PM Modi and Putin also travelled in the same car to the destination of their bilateral meeting after the conclusion of the SCO Summit in China's Tianjin.In a social media post on X, PM Modi shared the image and said, ""After the proceedings at the SCO Summit venue, President Putin and I travelled together to the venue of our bilateral meeting.""According to news agency PTI, PM Modi was offered a lift by Putin in his Aurus limousine to reach the venue.“The two leaders continued their one-to-one dialogue on the way to the hotel where they were to be joined by members of their teams. However, on reaching the hotel they did not deboard the Russian president’s limousine and continued their conversation for 50 minutes,” Russian national radio station VestiFM reported.Later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the two leaders had a tête-à-tête in the car for about an hour.Commentators in Moscow say perhaps this was the most important confidential conversation between Modi and Putin during which they probably discussed issues “not for the ears of others.”PM Modi and Putin held a bilateral meeting, focusing on bolstering the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia, including the latest developments concerning Ukraine.PM Modi welcomed the recent efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and said that the involved parties will have to proceed further ""constructively.""""This is the definition of our deep, 'special and privileged strategic partnership',"" PM Modi said.In a post on X, the spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, said, ""India-Russia | Bolstering the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership.

Putin said that the bilateral tes, which are friendly and based on trust,will continue to grow.The PM spent more time with Putin in Tianjin than with any other leader. This included thecarpool ride, another 45 minutes in the car even after reaching the meeting venue and an hour-long bilateral meeting. According to official sources, Putin wanted to travel together with Modi from the SCO summit venue to the hotel where the meeting was to take place, and even waited for about 10 minutes for the PM to join him. The leaders, who were also spotted in a huddle with President Xi Jinping at the SCO venue earlier, were said to havediscussed various issues in the car, while the Russian and Indian delegations waited inside the hotel.In the bilateral meeting, Modi did not specifically call for an immediate ceasefire but told Putin in his opening remarks that the “aspiration of entire humanity” was for all parties to work constructively and end the conflict.“We hope that all parties shall proceed ahead constructively. A way must be found to end this conflict and establish lasting peace,” recalling his past conversation with Putin on the issue and welcoming all recent efforts for establishing peace.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called Modi ahead of the meeting to emphasise the need for an immediate ceasefire without which, he said, it was going to be difficult to have peace talks. He had said later Modi was ready to give “appropriate signal” to Putin.According to an Indian readout, the leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, including in the economic, financial, and energy sectors and expressed satisfaction with the sustained growth in bilateral ties in these areas.On Ukraine, it said, Modi reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and to find a durable peace settlement.“The two leaders reaffirmed their support for further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries,” said the Indian government, adding that the PM was looking forward to hosting him for the 23rd annual summit later this year.

India and Russia have always stood shoulder-to-shoulder even in the most difficult situations,” said Modi.In his own remarks, Putin said that the multifaceted Russia–India ties will continue to actively develop and trade and economic ties are seeing “positive momentum”.“Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades – friendly and based on trust. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future, and these relations are absolutely non-partisan in nature, supported by the overwhelming majority of the peoples of our two countries,” said Putin, adding the 2 countries will closely coordinate efforts on global forums like the UN, BRICS, G20 and SCO.This was the first meeting between Modi and Putin after the Trump administration an additional 25 percent tariff on India for its procurement of crude from Russia. Top US officials have repeatedly targeted India in the past few weeks, accusing the Indian government of bankrolling Russia’s war machine and even calling it Modi’s war.

'No Perpetrators...': SCO Summit Delivers Stunning Blow To Pakistan Over Pahalgam Terror Attack

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member states on Monday have 'strongly condemned' the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 expressing their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.""The Member States strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on 22 April 2025. They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the dead and the wounded. They further stated that perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice,"" the declaration read.The condemnation was part of the Tianjin Declaration, issued at the Council of Heads of State meeting during the ongoing SCO summit in China.The declaration emphasised that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice. It reaffirmed the SCO members’ firm commitment to fighting terrorism, separatism, and extremism. It also highlighted the inadmissibility of attempts to use terrorist, separatist, or extremist groups for mercenary purposes.It further stressed the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.Member states strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, underscoring that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On 22 April, a terrorist attack in Baisaran Valley, Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir , killed 26 people, including 25 Indians and a Nepali tourist.In retaliation, India launched Operation Sindoor on the night of 6–7 May. The tri-services operation, carried out from Indian soil, targeted nine terror hideouts of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.","Shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) member states have'strongly condemned' the terrorist attack in pahalgam on april 22.

"SCO condemns Pahalgam, PM says certain states’ support for terrorism unacceptable",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sco-condemns-pahalgam-pm-says-certain-states-support-for-terrorism-unacceptable/articleshow/123643111.cms,"SCO Echoes India’s Stance On Pahalgam Terror Attack; Pak PM Watches In Silence

The SCO Tianjin Declaration strongly condemned the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack saying that the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of such attacks must be brought to justice. Without naming Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi in his address warned member-states against double standards on terrorism and questioned if the open support for terrorism by certain countries can ever be acceptable to the member-states.While the strong condemnation of Pahalgam allowed India to endorse the declaration, the SCO in the same breath, and as a compromise sought by Pakistan, condemned the terrorist attacks on Jaffar Express in March and another attack in Khuzdar in May this year.Pakistan has accused India of having a role in the Jaffar Express attack. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had earlier refused to sign on to a joint statement by SCO that didn’t mention the Pahalgam attack on civilians in J&K.“We have to say clearly, and in one voice, that no double standards on terrorism will be acceptable. We have to oppose terrorism together, in every colour and form. This is our responsibility towards humanity,” said Modi in his remarks at the summit.The PM said that SCO stood for 3 pillars - Security, Connectivity and Opportunity. In his remarks, Modi mentioned the Pahalgam attack, calling it an assault not just on the conscience of India but also an open challenge to every country and every individual who believes in humanity.“For the past 4 decades, India has been bearing the grave scars of ruthless terrorism. Countless mothers have lost their children, and innumerable children have been left orphaned. Recently, we witnessed the most heinous face of terrorism in Pahalgam,” said the PM, thanking all nations that stood by India.Modi also said that Terrorism was not only a threat to the security of individual nations, but a shared challenge to all of humanity. “No country, no society, no citizen can consider themselves completely safe from it. That is why India has consistently stressed the importance of unity in the fight against terrorism,” he said, recalling India’s initiative under the SCO counterterrorism mechanism to counter Al-Qaeda and its affiliated terrorist organizations. He backed joint measures against radicalization, extremism and separatism and thanked SCO for supporting India’s position on terror-financing.The Declaration strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, stressed that double standards in the fight against terrorism are unacceptable, and called on the international community to combat terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorists.On connectivity, India again was the only SCO State to not back China’s BRI because its flagship project, China Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir. The PM said in his remarks “connectivity that bypasses sovereignty ultimately loses both trust and meaning”.Modi underlined that efforts towards connectivity must uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, saying this is also enshrined in the core principles of the SCO Charter. He also urged SCO to increase mutual cooperation for reforms of global institutions and call unanimously for UN reform.“To confine the aspirations of the Global South to outdated frameworks is to deny justice to future generations. The colourful dreams of the new generation cannot be displayed on a black-and-white screen. It is time to change the screen,” he said.The PM also underscored that India has been an active member of SCO, which many see as an important platform for India to stress its strategic autonomy, and has always contributed in a constructive and positive manner.While underlining the significance of sovereignty, Modi backed strong connectivity saying it does not merely facilitate trade but also opens the doors to trust and development. “It is with this vision that we are working on initiatives such as the Chabahar Port and the International North-South Transport Corridor. Through these, we can enhance our linkages with Afghanistan and Central Asia,” said the PM.On opportunity, Modi backed more cooperation and reform recalling that in 2023, under India’s presidency, the SCO witnessed “fresh energy and ideas” along with new areas of cooperation like start-ups and innovation, traditional medicine and digital inclusion. To strengthen people-to-people ties, he proposed creation of a Civilizational Dialogue Forum under the SCO. “Such a platform will allow us to share the richness of our ancient civilizations, art, literature, and traditions on a global stage,” said Modi.",Sco echoes india’s stance on pahalgam terror attack; pak pm watches in silence.

How Russia's S-400 helped India in Operation Sindoor against Pakistan



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin were seen sharing light moments and walking hand-in-hand during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin on Monday, while Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif looked on as the leaders passed him during the group photo session.PM Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation, underscoring the camaraderie among the three leaders at the summit.“Interactions in Tianjin continue! Exchanging perspectives with President Putin and President Xi during the SCO Summit,” PM Modi posted on X, along with pictures from the event.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that Pm Modi will address the plenary session of the 25th SCO Heads of State Council Summit later in the day. “Prime Minister will be addressing the plenary session of the Summit, where he will outline India’s approach to fostering regional cooperation under the SCO umbrella,” Misri said.Following the plenary, PM Modi is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. On Sunday, PM Modi also met Xi, where both leaders agreed that India and China are “development partners, not rivals.”They emphasised the need for peace along the border, supported a mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary issue, and agreed to resume direct flights.Modi also invited Xi to attend the 2026 Brics Summit in India.In another engagement, PM Modi met Xi’s close aide Cai Qi in Tianjin. During the meeting, PM Modi shared his vision for India-China relations, while Cai reaffirmed Beijing’s intent to deepen exchanges. Misri said a banquet was replaced by a brief interaction due to scheduling constraints.The SCO currently has 10 member states, with India becoming a full member in 2017.Meanwhile, India’s S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” missile defence systems played a crucial role during “Operation Sindoor” on the night of May 7 and 8. The Indian Air Force successfully intercepted Pakistani drones and missiles aimed at 15 Indian cities, according to ANI reports quoting domain experts.Officials confirmed that debris from Pakistani drones and missiles was recovered at multiple sites, providing evidence of the attack. India’s Integrated Counter-UAS Grid and Air Defence systems thwarted the attempt, preventing damage to key assets.The S-400 “Sudarshan Chakra” — India’s name for the Russian-made Triumf system — can engage targets up to 400 km away and detect threats as far as 600 km. Equipped with phased-array radar, it can track over 100 targets simultaneously and neutralise threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five S-400 units, the first of which was deployed in Punjab in 2021. The advanced system is seen as a game-changer in South Asia, bolstering India’s multi-layered air defence and giving it a strategic edge against Pakistan and China.The government described the May 7 strikes as “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,” clarifying that no Pakistani military installations were targeted. However, after Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, Indian forces struck back, neutralising Pakistani air defence systems, including one in Lahore.","Pm modi, putin and chinese president xi jinping were also seen laughing together and engaging in a cordial conversation.

""""It is true that corporate houses owned by upper castes are buying cheap oil from Russia and selling it to other countries after refining. Indians are not benefiting from this at all,"" he said, in remarks which appeared to be in tune with his party's attack on ""elites"", ""privileges"" and ""merit"": all of which were seen as shorthand for the party's current priority to raise a coalition of non-upper castes.Udit Raj's colleague from Tamil Nadu, MP Karti Chidambaram, said ""Boston Brahmins is a term used to describe the elite of society in common parlance"".Ironically, Brahmins in US have, for some time, been at the receiving end of Navarro's staunch ideological opponents in US, the liberal hawks usually aligned with the Democrats. A few years ago, Civil Rights Department of Democrat-controlled California sued Cisco Systems at the instance of a PIO employee who alleged that he was denied a leadership position by his upper caste colleagues; chiefly Sundar Iyer, an alumnus of Bombay IIT.Iyer who denied the charge and won a significant victory against Civil Rights Department, lamented about being accused of casteism. ""Civil Rights Department assigned Brahmin caste to me,"" Iyer had famously remarked while rebutting the charges against him.Equality Labs, widely seen as a group of activists who are unlikely to agree with Navarro and Trump's MAGA movement has taken upon itself to document alleged cases of caste-based discrimination in US: something which the Hindu groups have flayed as an attempt to divide Indians and, particularly, Hindus.The influence of ""liberals"" has appeared to be on the wane since Trump's success last Nov, with many Democrats and centrists blaming the success of MAGA on ""woke activism"".

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Far away from the raging bilateral tariff tensions, India and the US on Monday kicked off one of their largest-ever Army `Yudh Abhyas' exercise in Alaska, even as planning is underway to conduct the top-notch Malabar naval exercise among the `Quad’ countries off Guam in the Western Pacific in Nov.India-US ties may have plummeted after President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on New Delhi, but defence officials say the bilateral strategic partnership assiduously built over the last two decades, with defence cooperation being its cornerstone, is in no danger of unravelling as yet.“It’s early days yet…though mutual trust has taken a big hit, there is too much at stake,” an official said. Just in terms of defence acquisitions, the delivery of 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for $716 million in Aug 2021 to power the all-important indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, has just about begun after a two-year delay. India is also getting set to sign another deal with GE for 113 more such engines for $1 billion.Apart from other deals, India is also slated to receive 31-armed MQ-9B`Predator’ high-altitude, long endurance drones, ordered from the US for $3.8 billion in Oct last year, in the 2029-30 timeframe.The US has bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth over $25 billion since 2007, though there might be a re-think on future arms deals if the downward trajectory in bilateral ties continues amid the ongoing geopolitical churn unleashed by Trump.India, in pursuit of its “strategic autonomy”, of course, has already accelerated its re-engagement with China despite the continuing trust deficit on the border, while steadfastly sticking to its long-standing strategic-defence ties with Russia.Far away in the subarctic climate of Fort Wainwright in Alaska, over 450 Madras Regiment soldiers will undertake a spectrum of high-altitude tactical drills with troops from the 5th Infantry Regiment “Bobcats” of the Arctic Wolves Brigade Combat Team, 11th Airborne Division of the US, till Sept 14.“Over two weeks, the troops will rehearse joint heliborne operations, employment of surveillance resources and unmanned aerial systems, rock-craft, mountain warfare, casualty evacuation, combat medical aid and the integrated use of artillery, aviation and electronic warfare systems,” an Army officer said.Parallelly, India, the US, Australia and Japan are finalising the operational details for the upcoming 29edition of the high-voltage Malabar naval exercise off Guam. The Malabar began as a bilateral endeavour between India and the US in 1992but includes all “Quad” countries now, with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific and their resolve to deter any coercion in the crucial region.India and the US have been steadily cranking up the scope, strength, complexity and frequency of their bilateral exercises, while stepping-up participation in multilateral ones, as part of their “strategic partnership and convergence” over the years.","India-us ties may have plummeted after president donald trump imposed 50% tariffs on new delhi. But defence officials say the bilateral strategic partnership assiduously built over the last two decades is in no danger of unravelling as yet. India and the us have been steadily cranking up the scope, strength, complexity and frequency of their bilateral exercises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123643400,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1408380,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
