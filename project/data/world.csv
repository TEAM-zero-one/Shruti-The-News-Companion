Path of peace only option for welfare of humanity: PM Modi



The Brics summit saw PM Modi Sunday making a passionate plea for reforming global institutions, while also coming down heavily on the issue of terror. ""Condemning terror should be our principle, not just a convenience. If we first see in which country an attack took place and against whom, it will be a betrayal of humanity,"" he said.Modi said the attack in Pahalgam was a blow not only to India but ""entire humanity"", adding there should be no hesitation in imposing sanctions against terrorists, and that victims and supporters of terror couldn't be weighed on the same scale.Brics condemned in ""the strongest terms"" the Pahalgam attack, and backed a comprehensive reform of UNSC - two key takeaways for India from the Rio summit.PM Modi also called upon Brics to adopt a clear and unified stance on overcoming terrorism . ""On a subject like terrorism, there is no room for double standards. If any country provides direct or indirect support to terrorism, it must pay the price for it,"" the PM said.""For personal or political gain, giving silent consent to terrorism, supporting terror or terrorists, should not be acceptable under any circumstances. There should be no difference between words and actions regarding terrorism,"" said the PM.""If we cannot do this, then the question naturally arises whether we are serious about the fight against terrorism or not,"" he added.While describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a cause of great concern, Modi said India firmly believes that no matter how difficult the circumstances are, the path of peace is the only option for the welfare of humanity.""India is the land of Lord Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. There is no place for war and violence for us. India supports every effort that takes the world away from division and conflict and leads it towards dialogue, cooperation and coordination, and increases solidarity and trust,"" he said.On reforms, he said with Brics having included new members the same determination must be shown to reform institutions like UNSC, WTO, and multilateral development banks.He sought to drive home his point on reforms by stating in his address that in the age of AI, where technology evolves every week, it's unacceptable for global institutions to go 80 years without reform. ""You can't run 21st-century software on 20th-century typewriters,"" said the Prime Minister.The PM said two-thirds of humanity still lack proper representation in global institutions built in the 20th century. ""Many countries that play a key role in today's global economy are yet to be given a seat at the decision-making table. This is not just about representation, it's also about credibility and effectiveness,"" he said, adding that with the Global South, these institutions are like a mobile phone with a SIM card but no network.They're unable to function properly or meet the challenges of the 21st century, said Modi, adding that the Global South has often faced double standards.""Whether it's about development, distribution of resources, or security related matters, the interests of the Global South have not been given due importance,"" he said, adding that whether it's ongoing conflicts, the pandemic, economic crises, or emerging challenges in cyber or space, global institutions had failed to offer solutions.","Pm modi: condemning terror should be our principle, not just a convenience.

'Iran Won't Stop': Khamenei Aide's JAW-DROPPING Speech At BRICS Sends Shockwaves In Israel & U.S.

NEW DELHI: The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in “the strongest terms” the Pahalgam terrorist attack, seeking concerted action against UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities, and unambiguously backed a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in 2 significant takeaways for India from the Rio Summit.Among other highlights was India joining BRICS in condemning attacks on Iran since June 13 (without naming Israel), expressing grave concern about the situation in “Occupied Palestinian territory” with the resumption of “continuous Israeli attacks” against Gaza, obstruction to humanitarian aid and use of starvation as a method of warfare – something which Israel has rejected.According to the Rio Declaration, BRICS nations expressed serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules.While this was an obvious message to the Trump administration, the declaration stopped short of naming the US because some members were not comfortable with it. The declaration also said that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures are contrary to international law and measures like unilateral economic sanctions have far-reaching negative implications.At India’s behest, there was ample focus on terrorism in the declaration that urged zero tolerance for terrorism and rejected double standards in countering terrorism. India uses the same language to counter Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism and also China’s shielding at the UN of UN-banned terrorists based in Pakistan.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025, during which at least 26 people were killed and many more injured. We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,” said the declaration, while calling for an expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN framework.According to Indian government officials, the Rio summit also adopted “strongest-ever language” for UN reforms by calling for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and toincrease the representation of developing countries. Recalling the 2022 Beijing and 2023Johannesburg Declarations, China and Russia, as permanent members of the UNSC, reiterated their support to the aspirations of Brazil and India to play a greater role in the United Nations, including its Security Council. Interestingly, the Beijing declaration had only said in the UN, and not 'including in UNSC'. The Rio Declaration also said a reformed UNSC will amplify the voice of the Global South.While condemning the attacks on Iran – and expressing concern over “deliberate” attacks on “peaceful” nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards – the declaration was also littered with references to the Israel-Palestine issue, something which continues to test India’s balancing exercise. In the case of Iran, there was no mention of Israel like in an earlier statement by BRICS last month, which too was endorsed by India, but on this occasion the declaration didn’t just express concern but also condemned the military strikes.In the case of Gaza, the declaration explicitly mentioned “continuous Israeli attacks” calling for adherence to international law and recalling that the Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also called for full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip while seeking talks for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.However, while the Rio summit cranked up the pressure on Israel by mentioning allegations like the use of starvation, this is not the first time that India has joined BRICS in condemning some of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It did so in a meeting of the foreign ministers in June last year and again at the Kazan summit where BRICS denounced Israel’s attacks against humanitarian operations and facilities.",The 11-member brics comprising key emerging economies condemned in ‘the strongest terms’ the pahalgam terrorist attack. They unambiguously backed a comprehensive reform of the un security council (unsc) india joined brics in condemning attacks on iran since june 13 (without naming israel),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77036,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto 's comments on offering extradition of wanted Pakistani terrorists to India seems to have hit a raw nerve with Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed 's son Talha. Reacting sharply to remarks Bhutto made in a recent interview, Talha accused him of making an ""irresponsible offer"".Instead of offering extradition of Pakistani citizens, Talha said Pakistan govt should be demanding the extradition of Indian leaders. He also questioned Bhutto's credibility, alleging that his family has a history of towing the Western and Indian narrative against Pakistan.During the interview with Qatar-based Al Jazeera on Friday, Bhutto had asserted that his country had no objection to extraditing terrorists like Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar to India as a ""confidence-building measure"".Pakistan is ready to extradite ""individuals of concern"" to India provided New Delhi showed ""willingness"" to cooperate in the process, Bhutto had said while responding to a question about extraditing LeT chief Saeed and Jaish-e-Muhammed kingpin Masood Azhar as a gesture of good faith.In a video issued on Sunday, Talha claimed that Bhutto's statement about his father had brought shame to Pakistan globally. ""Bilawal Bhutto's suggestion to hand over his father to India, a hostile country, is unacceptable and will be opposed by us and our community,"" he said.Both Saeed and his son Talha are listed as global terrorists by US treasury department.Shortly after Talha's video, Pakistan Markazi Muslim League, political offshoot of LeT/Jamaat-ud-Dawa, released a statement claiming India was involved in terrorism in Pakistan and Indian State was the mastermind of vicious terror campaigns in Pakistan and around the world.","Bilawal bhutto's comments on offering extradition of wanted pakistani terrorists to india seems to have hit a raw nerve with lashkar-e-taiba chief hafiz saeed's son talha.

However, it's learnt that Pakistan had refused to accept his body that was found on Tiger Hill in the Dras sub-sector.According to a press release issued by the Indian embassy in Washington on July 15, 1999, Pakistan authorities adamantly refused to acknowledge the involvement of Pakistan army regulars in the misadventure in Kargil and as a part of that process did not initially acknowledge Khan's identification by India through correspondence found on him.""It is clear that Pakistan is fully aware of the identities of these bodies but they do not wish to acknowledge this fact as it would immediately expose their army's involvement in Kargil. Hence, their persistent and callous refusal to do so, they are doing great disservice to the families of their soldiers and to the traditions of armed forces everywhere,"" the embassy had said in its statement.India had approached Pakistan on July 12, saying it would like to hand over the body to the Pakistan army.Subsequently, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) approached India on July 13, stating that the Pakistan govt had requested them to contact India for handing over the bodies of the two officers about which they had heard.""The Pakistani request did not specify the names and identities of the two officers, despite the information being available to them.

Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-CJI eviction notice



With Supreme Court taking an unusual step of asking the govt to take back the official bungalow of CJI at 5, Krishna Menon Marg, officials are hopeful of the situation sorting out itself sparing them of an unpleasant task of serving eviction notice to a former CJI. Media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud as saying they (he & family) are set to move out in a few days.Amid media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud saying they (he & family) are set to move out and it was only a matter of a few days, officials in the housing and urban affairs ministry said they are hopeful that there would be no need for serving an eviction notice. Officials said this is perhaps for the first time when the SC administration has asked it to get a bungalow vacated from a former CJI and return it to the SC housing pool for fresh allotment.They added that for them it was a peculiar situation since the bungalow is placed under the SC housing pool and it is the apex court which takes a call on allotment. In a July 1 letter to the housing and urban affairs secretary, the SC administration had pointed out that the time allowed for the former CJI to vacate the official accommodation had expired, and hence, the bungalow must be vacated without delay.Sources said SC authorities wrote to the ministry as all govt accommodations, including those meant for judges and belonging to the SC pool, fall under the ministry's jurisdiction and it is the ministry that is responsible for carrying out any eviction.SC is in need of official accommodation for four judges, sources said.Rule 3B of the SC Judges Rules, 2022, allows retired CJIs to retain their bungalow for up to six months after retirement. Justice Chandrachud, who retired as CJI in Nov 2024, has been staying there. In Dec, he wrote to his successor and former CJI Justice Sanjiv Khanna, seeking time until April 30, 2025, to retain the bungalow, and this was allowed.Again in April, he wrote to the then CJI, Khanna, seeking time until June 30, citing difficulty in finding a suitable accommodation.",Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-cji eviction notice.

Poll Should the Indian Air Force continue to provide assistance for foreign military operations? Yes, it strengthens relationships No, focus on national security

NEW DELHI: A team of around 25 UK aviation engineers arrived in Kerala on Sunday aboard a Royal Air Force Airbus A400M to begin repair work on a British F-35B Lightning fighter jet that has remained grounded at the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport since June 14 following an emergency landing.The aircraft, part of the UK Royal Navy’s HMS Prince of Wales Carrier Strike Group, made an unscheduled landing due to an “engineering issue,” according to a British High Commission statement. The advanced fifth-generation stealth jet, valued at over $110 million, has since been stationed at Bay 4 under 24x7 CISF guard.The jet was shifted to the airport’s Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility on Sunday after the arrival of the engineering team with specialised equipment. Officials said the relocation was carried out to minimise disruption to airport operations.“The UK has accepted the offer of space in the MRO facility and is in discussions to finalise arrangements with the relevant authorities,” the High Commission said. “In line with standard procedure, the aircraft was moved following the arrival of the UK engineers.”Airport officials and local agencies are providing logistical support to the visiting team, including meals and accommodation.The Indian Air Force is assisting with the repair efforts and overall coordination. Thiruvananthapuram is a designated emergency diversion site for British military aircraft operating in the region.According to sources, the pilot and technical crew were moved to the airport’s Emergency Medical Centre after landing and not stationed beside the aircraft, as was claimed in some social media posts.The British High Commission confirmed that the aircraft would resume service after the required repairs and safety checks. “Ground teams continue to work closely with Indian authorities to ensure safety and security precautions are observed. The UK remains very grateful for the continued support and collaboration of Indian authorities and airport teams,” the spokesperson said.A preliminary assessment by UK engineers on board HMS Prince of Wales indicated that repairs could not be conducted on the carrier and would require support from specialists flown in from the UK. The F-35B, capable of short take-off and vertical landing, is designed for operations from aircraft carriers and forward bases.Earlier this month, the HMS Prince of Wales Carrier Strike Group had participated in joint exercises with the Indian Navy.",A team of around 25 uk aviation engineers arrived in kerala on sunday to begin repair work on a british f-35b lightning fighter jet.

India was confident of Pahalgam consensus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-was-confident-of-pahalgam-consensus/articleshow/122284444.cms,"NEW DELHI: India went into the Brics summit feeling confident it would be able to negotiate the duelling pressures from members of the grouping and get member countries to condemn the Pahalgam attack despite the presence of China and its increasing brazenness in obscuring Pakistan's continuing use of terrorism.Govt sources, while agreeing with the estimates in many quarters that reconciling the divergent perspectives of Brics members would be a challenging task, had expressed confidence that India's enhanced standing would help it overcome any problems.""From being the weakest link in the Brics chain to being an economy with a growth rate and low inflation, a robust digital public infrastructure, there has been a transformation, which has helped us push India-specific concerns,"" the sources said.Referring to the stand against terrorism, they said since 2014, the Modi govt has focused on getting the world to recognise the need for collective action against the scourge. ""India's consistent push to address terrorism in all its forms led to the creation of the Brics counter-terrorism working group, and under India's leadership at the 13th Summit in 2021, the group adopted a Counter Terrorism Action Plan, marking a shift from broad declarations to concrete institutional mechanisms for intelligence sharing, capacity building and preventing the misuse of financial and digital networks by terror networks,"" according to the sources.They also said India was instrumental in using the forum to support its pitch for democratising multilateral institutions - a theme PM Modi articulated in his address to the Summit on Sunday.Sources also mentioned India's initiatives, including the call for the launch of Brics Startup Forum and inclusion of digital public infrastructure in the core agenda, to argue that India has moved from the sidelines to the centre stage of the group. ""India has become a voice that is heard. It isn't easy to imagine that 12 years ago, many seriously debated whether to replace India, with the lowest growth rate and high inflation, with Indonesia as a member,"" said sources.","India went into the brics summit feeling confident it would be able to negotiate the duelling pressures from members of the grouping.

Brics holds immense potential to shape a more inclusive and equitable global future,” PM Modi said in a post on X.In his address at the first plenary session, PM Modi said the Global South has often been a victim of “double standards,” particularly when it comes to development, distribution of resources, and security.He argued that countries making major contributions to the global economy still lack representation in key decision-making bodies.“The Global South has often been a victim of double standards. Whether it is about development, distribution of resources, or security-related issues,” he said. PM Modi added that on issues like climate finance, sustainable development and access to technology, developing countries have received little more than token gestures.He criticised the outdated nature of global institutions, noting, “In the age of artificial intelligence, where technology is updated every week, it is not acceptable for a global institution to not be updated even once in 80 years.” He added that “21st century software cannot be run by 20th century type-writers.”Calling for comprehensive reforms of institutions such as the UN Security Council, WTO and multilateral development banks, he said reforms should not be symbolic but must include real changes to governance structures, voting rights and leadership positions.“The challenges of the countries of the Global South should be given priority in policy-making,” he stressed, while describing Brics expansion as proof of the bloc’s ability to evolve with time. He further said, “India has always considered it its duty to rise above its own interests and work in the interest of humanity.”The ministry of external affairs also highlighted the collective stance of the bloc. “A collective commitment to addressing global challenges & promoting common values.

Ahmedabad crash fallout: DGCA directs AI & IndiGo to conduct post trauma workshops for 'worried' crew members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahmedabad-crash-fallout-dgca-directs-ai-indigo-to-conduct-post-trauma-workshops-for-worried-crew-members/articleshow/122284059.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed India’s major airlines — Air India and IndiGo — to hold post trauma mental health workshop for their flight crew. The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic June 12 AI 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives on the mental health of both pilots and cabin crew. AI even saw mass sick reporting by them soon after the crash on a few days as the many of the crew members were too stressed to report to work in the right frame of mind.“The DGCA has asked AI to hold the workshops and offer support. AI despatch now often has a psychologist in case some crew members wants counselling before operating their flight. IndiGo, which has a very wide network, has been asked to conduct e-modules of this workshop,” said officials across airlines.Pilots are especially on the tenterhooks as there has been no preliminary report even 24 days after the accident that could indicate what caused the crash just 30 seconds after take off. No one knows who all are investigating the crash, apart from AAIB chief. That suspense is taking its toll on everyone, but more so airline crew. Now it is common for crew to say a silent prayer first when an aircraft gets safely airborne and then when it completes its journey.The DGCA has even directed the major airlines “not to push” crew to come to work if they are not feeling upto it to operate a flight. “Mental health affects physical health, which in turn affects the ability to operate flights safely. Till the cause, even a preliminary one, is known of AI 171 crash, the feeling of jitteriness among crew members is likely to continue,” they said.“One of the two major Indian carriers has been putting crew members on standby duty whenever it wants, thereby inducing more stress among pilots even though there are required number of standby crew when the flight programme is published. Then there are continuing pay issues with the fix pay being reduced to 40 hours from 70 earlier. Our weekly offs are not printed on the rosters. As it is this was causing both mental and financial stress among pilots. The crash has made things even worse for us,” said pilots.Multiple pilots, especially of the Boeing 787 that crashed in Ahmedabad last month, have been reporting trauma after the accident. “The conversation in cockpits these days is mostly limited to what could have caused the crash. What is it that went wrong. That is really eating us up. With no guidance from the probe panel so far, we are all in the dark and jittery,” said multiple pilots.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has guidelines on how aviation medical examiners should assess and evaluate pilots for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The European, Australian and International Civil Aviation Organisation also have guidelines for the assessment of PTSD in aviation. PTSD is known to compromise aviation safety.",The directive comes after witnessing a significant massive impact of the tragic june 12 ai 171 crash in which 260 people lost their lives.

China 'deployed' embassies to undermine Rafale: French intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-deployed-embassies-to-undermine-rafale-french-intel/articleshow/122286606.cms,"PARIS: China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of French-made Rafale jets after they saw combat in India and Pakistan's clashes in May, French military and intelligence officials have concluded, implicating Beijing in an effort to hammer the reputation and sales of France's flagship fighter.Findings from a French intelligence service seen by Associated Press say defence attaches in China's foreign embassies led a charge to undermine Rafale sales, seeking to persuade countries that have already ordered the French-made fighter - notably Indonesia - not to buy more and to encourage other potential buyers to choose Chinese-made planes. The findings were shared with AP by a French military official .Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware - particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles - fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters.Sales of Rafales and other armaments are big business for France's defence industry and help efforts by govt in Paris to strengthen ties with other nations, including in Asia where China is becoming the dominant regional power.Pakistan claimed its air force downed five Indian planes during the fighting, including three Rafales. French officials say that prompted questions about their performance from countries that have bought the fighter from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation.India acknowledged aircraft losses but didn't say how many. French air force chief Gen Jerome Bellanger said that he's seen evidence pointing to just 3 Indian losses - a Rafale, a Russian-made Sukhoi and a Mirage 2000.It was the first known combat loss of a Rafale. French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China. They say the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat. French military officials say they haven't been able to link the online Rafale-bashing directly to Chinese govt.But the French intelligence service said Chinese embassy defence attaches echoed the same narrative in meetings they held with security and defence officials from other countries, arguing that IAFRafales performed poorly and promoting Chinese-made weaponry.Asked by AP to comment on the alleged effort to dent Rafale's appeal, ministry of national defence in Beijing said: ""The relevant claims are pure groundless rumours. China has consistently maintained a prudent approach to military exports, playing a constructive role in regional and global peace and stability.""

Chiefs owner’s wife Tavia Hunt shares heartbreaking update after Texas flood leaves family devastated and grieving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-owners-wife-tavia-hunt-shares-heartbreaking-update-after-texas-flood-leaves-family-devastated-and-grieving/articleshow/122282560.cms,"Tavia Hunt mourns tragic loss as Texas floods devastate her community (Getty Images)

Tavia Hunt’s emotional message stirs hearts as Texas flood takes personal toll on Chiefs owner’s family



Before Tavia Hunt stood in NFL stadiums, supporting the Kansas City Chiefs as their elegant matriarch, she was a woman of deep conviction, faith, and compassion. Born in Texas, her roots are embedded in humility and service — long before the spotlight found her. So when historic floods ravaged her home state this past week, she responded not as a public figure, but as a grieving Texan—one who felt the pain personally.Days of relentless rain turned deadly, sweeping through central and southern Texas with terrifying force. Rivers overflowed, roads vanished under murky water, and homes were ripped from their foundations. Cities like Martindale, New Braunfels, and San Marcos found themselves overwhelmed by a disaster not seen since the Memorial Day floods of 2015. At least six lives have already been lost, and the toll is expected to rise.In the midst of the chaos, Tavia Hunt’s voice rose on social media—not with rehearsed statements, but raw, faithful vulnerability. “Hearts are broken,” she began in her emotional post. “If your heart is broken, I assure you God is near. He is gentle with your wounds. And He is still worthy—even when your soul is struggling to believe it. Trust doesn’t mean you’re over the pain; it means you’re handing it to the only One who can hold it with love and restore what was lost.For we do not grieve as those without hope.”Her words offered comfort where few could. This wasn’t a press release or obligatory sympathy—it was spiritual solidarity from someone who was grieving, too. As she revealed, the tragedy struck far too close. “Our hearts are broken by the devastation from the floods in Wimberley and the tragic loss of so many lives — including a precious little Hunt cousin, along with several friend’s little girls,” she shared.T hat loss, tied to Camp Mystic—a Christian summer retreat near the Guadalupe River—was among the worst of the unfolding disaster. Authorities confirmed that 27 girls from the camp remain unaccounted for. With floodwaters rising as high as 29 feet, more than 850 people have already been rescued. But Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice cautioned, “We will not put a number on the other side because we just don’t know.”For Texans like Tavia, this isn’t just a natural disaster—it’s a spiritual test, one that calls for faith, resilience, and unity. Her heartfelt post reminds us that even in public grief, there is healing in vulnerability. And in moments of devastation, it’s compassion, not celebrity, that makes the difference.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s love life in the headlines again — Jordon Hudson’s stunning reaction flips the media narrative","Kansas city chiefs owner tavia hunt is a woman of deep conviction, faith, and compassion.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania trump received an eb-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Insider warns Leafs can’t afford to wait while the trade market heats up

The Toronto Maple Leafs are officially on the clock. After trading away star winger Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade with the Vegas Golden Knights, the Leafs are scrambling to fill the massive void left by his departure—and time is quickly running out.T oronto entered free agency eyeing top-six replacements but came up short on several key targets. Both Nikolaj Ehlers and Brock Boeser—widely viewed as ideal candidates to slot alongside Auston Matthews—opted to sign elsewhere, despite Toronto’s competitive offers. Ehlers landed with the Hurricanes on a six-year, $51 million deal, while Boeser stayed loyal to Vancouver, rejecting more money from the Leafs.TSN’s Mike DiStefano didn’t sugarcoat the urgency surrounding the situation. “Obviously, that’s a big hole, right, for the Maple Leafs, and they’ve got to fill that Mitch Marner hole,” DiStefano said on OverDrive. He acknowledged that while Matias Maccelli—one of Toronto’s recent additions—has potential, “That’s not gonna replace 100 points. That’s not gonna replace your top penalty killer, the guy who controls your power play.With few high-end wingers remaining on the open market, DiStefano believes General Manager Brad Treliving must now shift focus to the trade market. “I’m curious to see what Brad Treliving has up his sleeve to make that placement,” he added.So far, the return for Marner—center Nicolas Roy—is underwhelming when measured against the superstar’s production. Roy notched 31 points last season and is unlikely to provide the scoring punch Toronto urgently needs. Meanwhile, the team still has $4.9 million in cap space, but that figure may not be enough to land the kind of impact player they need without making further roster moves.Also Read: NHL Contract Extension: Golden Knights begin talks to make Jack Eichel highest-paid player in franchise history If the Leafs want to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference and keep Matthews in championship contention mode, the front office must act decisively—and soon.

Aaron Rodgers blames family for betrayal and shuts the door on reconciliation

Aaron Rodgers may be building a new chapter with his wife Brittani, but behind his high-profile life remains a longstanding emotional wound—one that still hasn’t healed. The NFL veteran's strained relationship with his family has been one of the sport's most talked-about yet mysterious personal stories. Now, new details have emerged shedding light on how close the Rodgers family came to reconciliation—only to drift apart again.In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Rodgers’ biographer Ian O’Connor revealed that a brief moment of hope occurred in the fall of 2024. “In the early fall of 2024, there were a couple of hopeful emails exchanged between Aaron and his parents,” O’Connor said. But that flicker of peace didn’t last. “By the end of the 2024 football season, the tone of their communication had changed and that cautious optimism about a potential reconciliation faded. ”This isn’t just a case of a football star avoiding family dinners. O’Connor explained that the estrangement spans over a decade and trickled down to Rodgers’ brothers, Luke and Jordan. At the heart of the family fracture was a deep divide over religion and personal values.Rodgers reportedly never connected with his parents’ evangelical faith, which they built their lives around in Chico, California. Instead, his worldview began to evolve during his college years at UC Berkeley.“Aaron questioned and challenged everything,” O’Connor noted. “He even questioned the role of his family in his life and came to believe that some family members were laying claim to his fortune and fame.” That belief system led to what O’Connor called “The Island,” where Rodgers isolates people he feels have violated his trust. “If you become a perceived obstacle in his path, you will be removed from his life,” he added.A brief moment of hope occurred in 2023 when Aaron saw his father, Ed, at a celebrity golf tournament and told him, “I love you.” But even that touching gesture wasn’t enough to rebuild a bridge.Most tellingly, during a June 2025 interview on ESPN’s The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers made it clear where things stood: “I don’t talk to” his family. “They wouldn’t know any information about me.”Also Read: Will Donald Trump become the unlikely savior of the Washington Commanders’ stadium comeback?
