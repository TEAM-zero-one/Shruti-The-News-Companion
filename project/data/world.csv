"'You are tubelights': Owaisi’s swipe at BJP after Nishikant Dubey's remark on SC, CJI Khanna",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-are-tubelights-owaisis-swipe-at-bjp-after-nishikant-dubeys-remark-on-sc-cji-khanna/articleshow/120447169.cms,"NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi mocked BJP leaders as ""tubelights"" on Sunday, following controversial remarks by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey against the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of India.Owaisi reminded the BJP of Article 142 of the Constitution, which grants the Supreme Court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.""You people (BJP) are tubelights... Do you even know what Article 142 is? It was framed by Dr. BR Ambedkar,"" Owaisi said, accusing the BJP of threatening the judiciary with religious warfare.You people are in power and have become so radicalised that you're now threatening the court with a religious war. Modi ji, if you don't stop these people, the country will become weak. The country won’t forgive you, and tomorrow, you won’t be in power,” he added.This comes in response to Nishikant Dubey’s comments suggesting that Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like a law-making body.Taking aim at the Supreme Court, Dubey said, “Kanoon yadi Supreme Court hi banayega to Sansad Bhavan band kar dena chahiye” (If the Supreme Court is going to make the laws, then the Parliament should be shut down).Targeting the Chief Justice of India, he added, “Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.”Echoing similar sentiments, BJP MP Dinesh Sharma said, “There is an apprehension among the public that when Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wrote the Constitution, the roles of the Legislature and the Judiciary were clearly defined. According to the Constitution, no one can direct the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the President has already given her assent to the law. No one can challenge the President, as the President is supreme…”These remarks come at a sensitive time, as the Supreme Court is currently hearing multiple petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, which was passed by Parliament in early April.In response to the court’s concerns, the Centre has agreed to temporarily hold off on implementing certain controversial provisions of the law until the next hearing.Meanwhile, the BJP has “outrightly rejected” and distanced itself from the remarks made by its MPs, and members have been cautioned against making such statements in the future.“The statements made by BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey and Dinesh Sharma regarding the judiciary and the Chief Justice have no connection whatsoever with the Bharatiya Janata Party . These are their personal views. The BJP neither agrees with nor endorses such statements. The BJP outrightly rejects them,” BJP national president J.P. Nadda said in a post on X.“The Bharatiya Janata Party has always respected the judiciary and has wholeheartedly accepted its orders and suggestions. As a party, we believe that the Supreme Court, along with all other courts in the country, is an integral part of our democracy and a strong pillar in safeguarding the Constitution. I have directed both of them—and everyone else—to refrain from making such statements,” he added.","Owaisi reminded the bjp of article 142 of the constitution, which grants the supreme court power to deliver complete justice in matters before it.

Here's what's on agenda:



Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Vance for talks and a dinner on Monday evening at his official residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.

The meeting with the Prime Minister is expected to cover progress on the India-US trade agreement and ways to deepen ties between the two countries. PM Modi is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia on April 22–23, so his schedule is tight.

PM Modi will host Vice President Vance for talks expected to focus on finalising the proposed India-US bilateral trade agreement and exploring ways to strengthen overall ties between the two countries.

The Indian delegation, led by PM Modi, is likely to include external affairs minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, and Indian Ambassador to the US Vinay Mohan Kwatra, according to officials.

Vance will be accompanied by at least five senior US officials, including representatives from the Pentagon and the State Department.

Shortly after arriving, Vance and his family are expected to visit the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple and a market selling traditional Indian crafts.

The Vance family will be staying at the ITC Maurya Sheraton hotel in Delhi.

Later on Monday night, the Vances will travel to Jaipur, where they will stay at the luxurious Rambagh Palace, a former royal residence.

On April 22, they will visit famous sites in Jaipur, including Amer Fort (also known as Amber Fort), a Unesco World Heritage Site.

In the afternoon, Vice President Vance will speak at the Rajasthan International Centre, where he is expected to talk about India-US relations under the Trump administration. Diplomats, Indian officials, academics, and policy experts are likely to attend.

The next day, April 23, the Vance family will travel to Agra to visit the iconic Taj Mahal and Shilpgram, an open-air market showcasing Indian art and crafts. They will return to Jaipur later that evening.

The Vances are scheduled to fly back to the US from Jaipur on April 24.

NEW DELHI: US Vice President JD Vance will arrive in India on Monday for his first visit to the country, along with his Indian-origin wife Usha Chilukuri Vance and their three children. The family will be in India for four days.This trip comes amid President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade moves, including a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods, as part of broader tariff announcements affecting countries worldwide.The Vances will be welcomed in Delhi by a senior Union minister.In a statement, the White House said, “Vice President J D Vance and the Second Family will travel to Italy and India from April 18 to 24.

'Hero' neighbours among 1st responders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hero-neighbours-among-1st-responders/articleshow/120446701.cms,"NEW DELHI: As the dust settled and the cries for help grew louder, a remarkable tale of humanity unfolded. Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.Taslim and Salman were among the first to respond to the collapse of the building on Street No. 1 in Shakti Vihar , Mustafabad. They rushed to the disaster site to see how they could help. They had no rescue equipment but plenty of determination and worked tirelessly, ultimately saving at least six lives.Taslim recalled the harrowing scene, ""For 15-20 minutes, there was only white dust, from which one could hear cries for help. We began lifting the broken cement blocks, working alongside others to rescue trapped people."" The six people they pulled out were sent to hospitals.Soon the professional rescue teams arrived on the scene, but that early intervention by the do-gooders proved crucial. The rescuers faced challenges in operating in the congested area, especially since the building had collapsed like a pancake, limiting the use of their equipment. According to Mohsen Shahedi, DIG (Operations), NDRF, such a collapse significantly reduces survival chances due to floors collapsing onto each other leaving little possibility of voids.Rescue teams typically use specialised equipment like wall detectors to locate trapped survivors. However, on this occasion, a rescue official explained, ""We couldn't use wall detectors due to significant disturbances since they rely on thermal waves. The movement of people was also a hindrance. Instead, we had to rely on cutters and drill machines.""According to NDRF officials, the narrow lane forced them to park their vehicles far from the spot, making it difficult to bring in dumpers to move debris and aid in the search. Fire tenders were parked at a distance and only one JCB excavator could be deployed. A canine squad was called to the spot to assist in the search and help the personnel pinpoint spots where the victims could be lying trapped.Two neighbouring buildings were also damaged and its residents had to be evacuated. ""If those buildings hadn't been affected, we would have had more space for rescue work,"" a fire officer said.According to rescuers, an empty space nearby was useful for throwing the debris. ""Because of space constraints, we had no other option but to stand on the rubble and work, which is not desirable because victims might be lying below at that spot. Even while using the drilling machine, we had to be very careful,"" said a rescuer.","Neighbours and rescuers scrambling among the rubble turned heroes digging out people to safety.

NEW DELHI: After Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar questioned Supreme Court , a BJP leader has added fuel to the fire, saying Parliament should stop functioning if the apex court acts like it. Targeting Chief Justice of India, he said, ""Sanjiv Khanna is responsible for all the civil wars happening in this country.""Taking aim at Supreme Court on Friday, seasoned BJP parliamentarian Nishikant Dubey in a cryptic post on X wrote, ""(Parliament should be closed down if the Supreme Court has to make the laws).""Later today, Dubey said that the Supreme Court is responsible for inciting religious wars in the country. ""The Supreme Court is going beyond its limits. If one has to go to the Supreme Court for everything, then Parliament and State Assembly should be shut,"" he added.""How can you give direction to the appointing authority? The President appoints the Chief Justice of India. The Parliament makes the law of this country. You will dictate that Parliament? How did you make a new law? In which law is it written that the President has to take a decision within three months? This means that you want to take this country towards anarchy. When the Parliament sits, there will be a detailed discussion on this,"" he further said.The BJP leader also criticised the apex court over Article 377, saying, ""there was an Article 377 in which homosexuality is a big crime. The Trump administration has said that there are only two sexes in this world, either male or female. Whether it is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh, all believe that homosexuality is a crime. One fine morning, the Supreme Court said that we abolish this case.""""Article 141 says that the laws we make, the judgments we give, are applicable from the lower court to the Supreme Court.

""Constitutional functionaries, ministers, BJP MPs are speaking against the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court is saying one thing that when a law is made, you should not go against the basic structure of the constitution and if the law is against the constitution, we will not accept it.

I hope that the Supreme Court judges will take this into notice as he is not speaking in Parliament but outside it.

In our legal system, the final word is not of the government, it is of the Supreme Court. If someone does not understand this, then it is a matter of great sadness.""AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said, ""He has made a very shoddy statement. I hope that tomorrow only, the Supreme Court will initiate suo-moto contempt proceedings against BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and send him to jail. Whenever any judge gives a judgment in favour of the BJP, they are sent to the Rajya Sabha , and now, when a judge gave an instruction that the law should be followed and governors should not sit indefinitely on bills, the BJP has used all its resources to defame the judges and attack the Supreme Court.""BJP's Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra said, ""On the Manipur issue, the Supreme Court took a suo motu cognisance, but we are seeing that several parts of West Bengal are burning, but the eyes of the Supreme Court are closed. The entire country is looking at the Supreme Court that the SC would give direction to the Govt to impose President's rule in West Bengal, but the Supreme Court is silent.""Dubey's remarks came amid hearings on several pleas ongoing in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Parliament passed the Bill in the first week of April.Meanwhile, Centre has decided not to implement some of its contentious provisions till the next date of hearing after court raised several concerns over them.The timing of Dubey's remark is also noteworthy as Vice President Jagdeep Dhankar recently voiced strong disapproval of Supreme Court's judgement after it set a timeline for the President to take decision on the bills sent to her.“We cannot have a situation where you direct the President of India and on what basis?” Dhankhar questioned SC while speaking to the sixth batch of Rajya Sabha interns at the Vice-President’s Enclave on Thursday.""There is a directive to the President by a recent judgement. Where are we heading? What is happening in the country? We have to be extremely sensitive. It is not a question of someone filing a review or not. We never bargained for democracy for this day. President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, becomes law,"" Dhankhar added.""President being called upon to decide in a time-bound manner, and if not, it becomes law. So we have judges who will legislate, who will perform executive functions, who will act as super Parliament, and absolutely have no accountability because law of the land does not apply to them,"" he further said.However, opposition parties lauded court's observation over the Waqf Act and direction to President.","Nishikant dubey says, 'parliament should be closed down if the supreme court has to make the laws' opposition slams dubey's statement saying, 'his attack on thesupreme court is not acceptable' dubey's remarks came amid hearings on several pleas ongoing in the supreme court challenging the constitutionality of the waqf (amendment) act.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120434838,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1199317,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has strongly condemned the brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy , a prominent Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh, calling it part of a “pattern of systematic persecution” of Hindus under Muhammad Yunus-led interim government.Ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal posted on X (formerly Twitter), “We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh. This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity. We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.”Roy, 58, served as the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad and was a well-known figure in the Hindu community of Dinajpur’s Biral upazila.According to his wife, Shantana Roy, Bhabesh was at home when he received a phone call around 4:30 pm on Thursday. She said the call was made by the perpetrators to confirm his presence at home. About 30 minutes later, four men reportedly arrived on two motorcycles and abducted him.Quoting eyewitnesses, The Daily Star reported that Bhabesh was taken to Narabari village, where he was brutally assaulted. Later that evening, the attackers allegedly brought his unconscious body back to his home on a van. Family members, aided by locals, rushed him to the Biral Upazila Health Complex. He was later transferred to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.His body has been sent for autopsy.Quoting Abdus Sabur, officer-in-charge of Biral police station, The Daily Star reported that preparations are underway to file a case. Police are currently working to identify and apprehend the suspects.The killing has sparked fresh outrage among human rights groups and diaspora communities, who have repeatedly raised concerns over the safety of religious minorities in Bangladesh.","India has strongly condemned the brutal killing of bhabesh chandra roy, a prominent hindu minority leader in bangladesh.

Poll What is your main concern about the visa revocation process for international students? Impact on students’ education and future opportunities Lack of transparency in the decision-making process

The US state department and Immigration & Customs Enforcement continue to aggressively target international students with visa revocations, termination of their legal status, and removal. With Indians constituting the largest cohort of international students, it isn't surprising that the majority of those impacted are from India.The American Immigration Lawyers Association collected 327 reports of visa revocations and SEVIS terminations from attorneys, students, and university employees and found that 50% of these international students were from India, followed by 14% from China.Other significant countries represented in this data include South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.“These reports paint aconcerning picture of the arbitrary nature of these visa revocations and terminations,” it states in its policy brief.As per an Open Doors Report for the academic year 2023-24, India sent over 3.3 lakh students to pursue higher education in the US — an increase of 23% over the previous year. China was the second leading place of origin with almost 2.8 lakh students —this was a slight decline of 4% over the previous year. Anecdotal evidence shows that the number of Indian students aspiring to study in US is dipping sharply.However, even as the crackdown on international students continues, several hundred students have filed lawsuits in US district courts challenging arbitrary termination of their legal status. Several courts have also granted ‘temporary restraining orders’, enabling students to continue their study in US.Referring to AILA’s policy brief, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh posted on X: “A press statement issued yesterday by the American Immigration Lawyers Association is cause for concern to us in India. Out of the 327 visa revocation cases of international students collected by the organisation so far, 50% are Indians. The reasons for revocation are random and unclear. There is growing fear and apprehension. Will the external affairs minister take note and raise the concern with his US counterpart?” He also tagged foreign minister S Jaishankar.“We are aware that several Indian students have received communication from the American govt regarding their F-1 visa status, which happens to be the student visa. We are looking into the matter. Our embassy and consulates are in touch with the students to provide support,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said at a weekly press briefing.International students on completion of their studies are allowed to gain work experience under the optional practical training program for a year — this is further extended by two years from students hailing from the science, technology, engineering and mathematics field. According to the Open Doors Report, over 97,000 students undergoing OPT post completion of their studies were from India, whereas Chinese students pursuing OPT stood at around 61,000.AILA’s policy brief points out that 50% of the impacted students were on OPT. “These individuals are unable to work immediately upon the termination of their SEVIS record. The road to reinstating status for those who have already graduated and are employed on OPT is much more difficult and murkier than those who are currently students,” it stated.The grounds on which action was taken against international students were arbitrary. In some cases international students found their SEVIS records were terminated and/or visas revoked owing to a criminal record — and they did not have a history of interaction with police and there was nothing in their record that would prompt a visa revocation.Students who encountered police for infractions are instances which most US citizens would consider a daily occurrence. These included not wearing a seatbelt, tickets for illegal parking, or speeding tickets and did not warrant visa revocation and/or SEVIS termination , states AILA.There was no uniformity in the issue of notices of SEVIS termination. There were many cases where there was a delay between the SEVIS termination and when the student was informed. This is risky because if students kept working without knowing their SEVIS was terminated, it could affect their immigration status, states AILA’s policy brief.","The us state department and immigration & customs enforcement continue to aggressively target international students. 50% of these international students were from india, followed by 14% from china.

India likely to explore ‘early tranche’ in US trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-talks-india-looks-at-early-tranche/articleshow/120443404.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian trade negotiators, who head to Washington DC this week ahead of formal launch of talks, may explore an ""early tranche"" that covers a limited set of issues, even as New Delhi and Washington seek to close negotiations quickly, possibly ahead of the fall deadline.The terms of reference or modalities for the proposed deal, running into 19 chapters, will include regulatory issues such as those related to digital tax, in addition to tariff cuts and non-tariff measures. The modalities have identified issues which are to be taken up and how the technical aspects of the negotiations, such as rules of origin or customs facilitation, would work. But firm offers will be made later.In early March, US President Donald Trump and PM Narendra Modi agreed to launch talks for a bilateral trade deal, but since then, reciprocal tariffs have come into the picture. With Trump offering a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, there may be an opportunity to harvest some of the low-hanging fruits that are mutually beneficial to both sides, sources indicated. Of course, it is contingent upon the American side being willing to engage in talks at a time when countries from across the globe are rushing to DC to see how they can avoid reciprocal tariffs.Some clarity is also expected to emerge during US Vice-President J D Vance's visit to India, starting Monday, when he is scheduled to meet Modi.The team led by India's chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal will be in DC for three-day talks from April 23 to discuss the path forward as technical talks commence. ""Both sides will discuss the level of ambition. The terms of reference will be further developed and discussed"" an official said.Sources said that services, which is a key focus for govt, is likely to be part of the second tranche. Trump has mainly focused on tariffs during his offensive against countries, including India, and wants duties slashed for products of interest to the US. In India's case, he and his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick have flagged areas such as automobiles, whiskey and farm products.","The terms of reference or modalities for the proposed deal, running into 19 chapters, will include regulatory issues such as those related to digital tax.

Modi and Crown Prince and PM Mohammed bin Salman will hold bilateral talks in Jeddah during which they will also look to discuss projects to facilitate the India Middle-East Europe Economic Corridor ( IMEEC ), work on which has continued despite the conflict in West Asia.Several MoUs, including one on green hydrogen , are expected to be signed by the two sides following the talks, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said at a press conference Saturday. There will be an effort to infuse a ""strategic"" dimension to India-Saudi Arabia energy cooperation, he added.The foreign secretary said that Modi's visit will provide an opportunity to build on the already strong strategic partnership between India and Saudi Arabia. Misri indicated that there could be discussions on how to take steps to facilitate Saudi Arabia's plan to invest $100 billion in India.During the crown prince's visit to India in 2019, Saudi Arabia had announced its plan to invest $100 billion in the energy sector and certain other sectors.

Taylor Swift’s new era with Travis Kelce sparks questions about Joe Alwyn’s quiet exit

Taylor Swift has always been intentional about her narrative—every lyric, outfit, and public appearance has meaning. But since going public with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, fans have noticed something subtle yet striking: the virtual disappearance of her ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn from her recent storylines. Was this deliberate, or just the natural progression of moving on?Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift were together for six years—her longest relationship to date. Though private, their romance heavily influenced several of her most emotionally resonant albums, including Folklore, Evermore, and parts of Midnights. Songs like “The 1,” “Invisible String,” and “Peace” were widely believed to be about the British actor. Yet since their split and her blossoming romance with Kelce, mentions of Alwyn have grown eerily scarce.Fans began to notice the shift during the international leg of Swift’s Eras Tour. As she introduced tracks from Midnights and updated setlists, her emphasis leaned more toward empowerment, growth, and joy—qualities many associate with her relationship with Kelce. The emotional depth of the Alwyn era seemed to fade into the background, replaced by sparkle, stadium anthems, and viral NFL appearances.Adding fuel to the speculation is Swift’s growing presence in sports culture, amplified by her relationship with Kelce. Her appearance at Chiefs games and Kelce’s cameos at her shows signal not just a relationship, but a cultural merge that’s being embraced by both fanbases. It’s a public evolution—and with it, perhaps, a quiet edit of what came before.While Swift has never directly commented on Alwyn post-breakup, her artistic choices may be doing the talking. Her newly released content and public appearances focus almost exclusively on the now—with Kelce prominently part of that picture.Whether Taylor is rewriting history or simply writing a new chapter, the shift is undeniable. Alwyn’s influence lives in her past work, but he no longer seems to have a place in the story she’s telling today.Also Read: The man behind Taylor Swift's love songs: Why Joe Alwyn’s influence may outlast Travis Kelce As Swift continues to evolve, one thing is clear: her legacy is hers to shape. And with Travis Kelce by her side, she seems more willing than ever to let go of what was and fully embrace what is—and what’s next.","Taylor swift and joe alwyn were together for six years.

Trump's tattoo theory to prove MS-13 gang ties: What experts say about President's renewed focus on ink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tattoo-theory-to-prove-ms-13-gang-ties-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-what-experts-say-about-presidents-renewed-focus-on-ink/articleshow/120425771.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s tattoos explained — as conspiracy theories run wild

President Donald Trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants , especially Venezuelans, drawing criticism from experts who say the practice is both flawed and misleading.Also read: Trump citing image of Gracia's hand to claim MS-13 connection Donald Trump recently invoked the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a 29-year-old Maryland resident deported to El Salvador on March 15, despite an active immigration court order blocking his removal. Sharing an image of tattooed knuckles allegedly belonging to Abrego Garcia, Trump claimed: “This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ‘a fine and innocent person.’ They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles... I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”.But multiple law enforcement officials and experts have warned against the Trump administration’s growing reliance on tattoos to determine gang affiliation — especially in the case of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua . “A tattoo itself is never sufficient evidence to prove a person is a member of a criminal group,” said Joseph Kenny, chief of detectives at the New York Police Department, according to a NYT report.Court documents and investigative reports indicate that US immigration officials are now using a 10-point scoring system under an internal guide — where gang-related tattoos can earn four points — to determine deportability under the Alien Enemies Act. Eight points are sufficient for expedited removal without a hearing. In one case, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist, was deported to El Salvador based solely on tattoos that read “Mom” and “Dad” inside crowns, according to a NYT report.While tattoos such as clocks, skulls, or train imagery have been linked to Tren de Aragua, five Venezuelan experts including police officials, academics, and a journalist told The New York Times that tattoos are not formal indicators of gang membership in Venezuelan street culture, where ink is common among young men regardless of affiliation.The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has further polarised debate. A New York Times video investigation debunked viral conspiracy theories that claimed his finger tattoos spelled out ""MS-13"" using a marijuana leaf, smiley face, cross, and skull. ICE officials reportedly told The Washington Post that they were unaware of such symbols being used by the gang. However, an ICE arrest report cited other tattoos — including skulls with eyes, ears, and mouths covered (a “see no evil” motif) and a devil with horns as signs of seniority within MS-13. His Chicago Bulls cap was also cited as evidence, according to the NYT report.Despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the lower court’s order to reverse the deportation, the White House has remained firm. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, “Abrego Garcia will never live in the United States of America,” accusing him of gang ties.Meanwhile, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele mocked allegations of mistreatment, posting photos of Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with Senator Chris Van Hollen. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the ‘death camps’ & ‘torture’, now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen,” he wrote on XLegal experts caution that even when tattoos are presented as evidence in court, they are rarely used as stand-alone proof. “A tattoo can be very telling. But are we going to base our decisions and law enforcement accusations and associations on a tattoo? Very, very unlikely,” said Ryan Brackley, assistant district attorney in Colorado’s Arapahoe County to NYTJohn Colello of the Los Angeles County DA’s gang homicide division agrees: “Facts and context are obviously important. Tattoos alone, or lack of tattoo, do not necessarily mean a person is, or is not, a gang member”","President donald trump is increasingly citing tattoos as proof of gang membership in his push to deport undocumented migrants, especially venezuelans.

"MS 13 Tattoo: What is the truth of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's MS-13 tattoo, a photo that Trump shared?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-truth-of-kilmar-abrego-garcias-ms-13-tattoo-a-photo-that-trump-shared/articleshow/120442009.cms,"Donald Trump shows a photo of an MS-13 tattoo on Garcia's hand, the same that gets covered by emojis in a photo posted by his wife and is visible in another (right) photo.

What is the truth of the photoshopped photo?



What is MS-13?



Donald Trump has been accused of sharing a fake image of the knuckles Kilmar Abrego Garcia which shows MS-13 written on it. Social media users pointed out that the letters M, S and the numbers 1 and 3 are superimposed on the photo and those letters and numbers do not appear on any other photos of Garcia. Garcia is a Maryland father who came to the US illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported. When the Trump administration sent a number of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 members to Venezuela's notorious prison, Garcia was also sent along with them.In a court case, the Trump administration claimed that he was wrongly deported to El Salvador, following which the court ruled that he should be brought back. But now the White House has made it clear that the person is not coming back. As defense, the Trump administration said firstly the ball is in El Salvador's court as they will have to decide whether they would release their prisoner, which Salvador president Nayib Bukele denied. Secondly, the Trump administration released several pieces of evidence to establish that Garcia is an MS-13 member, and a criminal.The words M, S and 13 are not part of the tattoo and they were used in the photo that Trump shared to denote the meaning of the tattoo. On the knuckles of Garcia's four fingers on his left hand, there are tattoos of four symbols which stand for M, S, 1 and 3.“This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such “a fine and innocent person.” They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the 78-year-old wrote.Another photo has gone viral in this context, in which those tattoos are hidden by love emojis posted by his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura.MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles, California, in the 1980s. Formed by Salvadoran immigrants fleeing civil war, it initially aimed to protect community members from other gangs. Over time, it evolved into a violent criminal organization. The name ""Mara Salvatrucha"" likely derives from ""mara"" (gang), ""Salva"" (Salvador), and ""trucha"" (street smarts), with ""13"" possibly indicating its alliance with the Mexican Mafia, as M is the 13th letter of the alphabet.","Kilmar abrego garcia is a maryland father who came to the us illegally but there was a 2019 court order that shielded him from being deported.

India’s central bank saw a sharp jump in the value of its gold reserves during the week ending April 11, driven by a global rally in gold prices amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty.According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday, the value of its gold holdings surged by Rs 11,986 crore in just one week. With this increase, the total value of RBI’s gold reserves has risen to Rs 6,88,496 crore, reported ANI.This sharp increase also reflects a broader trend over the past year. The RBI’s gold holdings have nearly tripled in value during this period, underlining a significant rise in gold purchases by the central bank.This comes at a time when central banks worldwide are stepping up their gold accumulation to hedge against global risks.Gold continues to be seen as a safe-haven asset during periods of uncertainty. The ongoing global trade tensions, particularly those linked to tariff disputes between the US and China, along with concerns over a weakening US dollar, have pushed central banks to increase their gold exposure.On the domestic front, gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) hit fresh record highs.The June 5 contract soared to Rs 95,935 per 10 grams on Thursday. The surge has been attributed to safe-haven demand spurred by the Trump administration’s tariff policy and retaliatory measures from China.“Gold prices raced to an all-time high, driven by a weaker dollar, trade war tensions and concerns over global economic growth due to US President Donald Trump's tariff plans, which led to safe-haven inflows,” said Manav Modi, senior analyst, commodity research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The RBI’s increasing gold reserves, coupled with a steady rise in overall foreign exchange reserves, point to a more resilient position in managing external shocks. Growing interest in gold-backed ETFs and central bank buying amid persistent geopolitical concerns has further fuelled the yellow metal’s upward trajectory globally.","India's central bank saw a sharp jump in the value of its gold reserves during the week ending april 11.

Judge orders Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk detained in Louisiana must be returned by May 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-orders-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana-must-be-returned-by-may-1/articleshow/120418549.cms,"Rumeysa Ozturk (AP Photo)

A Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University , detained in a Louisiana immigration facility, must be transported back to New England by May 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention following her co-authorship of an opinion piece in the student newspaper, as ordered by a federal judge on Friday.In Burlington, Vermont, U.S. District Judge William Sessions scheduled a bail hearing for May 9 and a merit hearing for May 22. Whilst Ozturk's legal team sought immediate release or transfer to Vermont, the justice department contended that jurisdiction belonged to a Louisiana immigration court.The judge stated in his ruling that the proceedings would continue with Ozturk physically present, acknowledging the seriousness of her habeas claims and committing to an expeditious review process.The case emerged after the 30-year-old doctoral candidate was apprehended by masked immigration officials on March 25 whilst walking in a Boston suburb. She was subsequently transported through New Hampshire and Vermont before being flown to Basile, Louisiana. On Wednesday, an immigration judge refused bond, citing concerns about danger and flight risk.Ozturk's situation reflects a broader pattern involving university-affiliated individuals whose U.S. visas were cancelled or entry denied following allegations of Palestinian support or protest participation. A similar case involves Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom authorities seek to deport based on national security concerns.Initially, Ozturk's legal representatives filed in Massachusetts, hampered by uncertainty about her location and communication restrictions. Ozturk reported making several unsuccessful attempts to contact legal counsel.The controversy stems from an opinion piece Ozturk co-authored with three other students in ""The Tufts Daily"", criticising the university's handling of student activists' demands regarding Palestinian issues and Israeli-linked investments.Her legal team argues that the detention violates constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and due process. While Judge Sessions acknowledged the plausibility of these constitutional claims, he determined they were insufficient for immediate release.A Department of Homeland Security representative claimed last month that investigations revealed Ozturk's involvement with Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation, though no supporting evidence was provided.","Rumeysa ozturk must be transported back to new england by may 1 for a hearing to assess the legality of her detention.
