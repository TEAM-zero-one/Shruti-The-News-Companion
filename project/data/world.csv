NEW DELHI: Pakistani troops fired without provocation in eight forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, violating ceasefire agreements, news agency ANI reported. Meanwhile, Army responded to the firing in a ""proportionate manner."" This is the 12th straight night of such firing along the LoC, amid tensions between India and Pakistan after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.""During the night of 05-06 May 2025, Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small-arms firing from posts across the Line of Control in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor in J&K,"" a defence spokesperson was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.""Indian Army responded in proportionate manner:"" he said.The firing began in five border aread – Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani and Akhnoor – during the night.Since April 24, just after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty following the Pahalgam terror attack , Pakistan has been firing in different areas along the LoC, starting from the Kashmir valley.On April 24, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian aircraft, shut the Wagah border crossing, stopped trade with India, and warned that any move by India to divert water from the Indus River system would be treated as an ""Act of War.""These firings have affected the ceasefire agreement from February 2021, with several violations reported in many sectors along the 740-km LoC.In February 2021, India and Pakistan had agreed to follow the 2003 ceasefire understanding to keep peace along the LoC.Moreover, as tensions between India and Pakistan grow, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) held a closed-door meeting where representatives urged both sides to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue.The 15-member Council met for about an hour and a half on Monday afternoon, but did not release any official statement following the discussion.Meanwhile, the Union home ministry has directed all states to carry out mock drills on Wednesday due to ""new and complex threats"" that have emerged following increased tensions with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack.As per a communication from the ministry, the drills will involve activating air-raid warning sirens, training civilians in civil defence to help them protect themselves during a ""hostile attack,"" and cleaning existing bunkers and trenches.India shares a 3,323 km-long border with Pakistan, divided into three parts: the International Border (IB) of about 2,400 km from Gujarat to Akhnoor in Jammu; the Line of Control (LoC) of 740 km from Jammu to Leh; and the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) of 110 km in the Siachen area, from NJ 9842 to Indira Col.On April 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged strong action against those responsible for the Pahalgam terror attack, saying the terrorists and their conspirators would be punished in ways beyond their imagination. He asserted that the attackers had not just targeted unarmed tourists, but had challenged the very soul of India.During a high-level meeting with senior defence officials on April 29, PM Modi said that the armed forces have full operational freedom to choose how, when, and where to respond to the attack, news agency PTI reported quoting government sources.","Pakistani troops fired without provocation in eight forward areas along the line of control (loc) in jammu and kashmir.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913946.cms,"NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses.

India to soon get 2nd advanced stealth frigate built in Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-soon-get-2nd-advanced-stealth-frigate-built-in-russia/articleshow/120912428.cms,"India to soon get 2nd advanced stealth frigate built in Russia

NEW DELHI: India will soon get its second powerful warship built in Russia, a multi-role stealth frigate packed with weapons and sensors, which will follow its sister ship INS Tushil commissioned in Dec last year.With India flexing its naval muscles in the Arabian Sea amid the heightened tensions with Pakistan, the Navy and DRDO on Monday also successfully undertook combat firing -- with reduced explosives -- of the indigenously developed underwater 'multi-influence ground mines' designed to destroy enemy submarines and stealth warships. ""The system will further enhance undersea warfare capabilities of the Indian Navy,"" defence minister Rajnath Singh said.The new 3,900-tonne frigate, which will be commissioned as INS Tamal , in turn, is likely to be handed over to the Indian Navy at Kaliningrad after the completion of all its crucial trials, including firing of weapons, in a month or so. ""The frigate will then be commissioned and set sail for India,"" an officer said on Monday.India in Oct 2016 had inked an umbrella agreement with Russia for four upgraded Krivak-III class frigates , with the first two to be imported for around Rs 8,000 crore. The other two, Triput and Tavasya, in turn, are being built at the Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at an overall cost of around Rs 13,000 crore.The first frigate, the 125-metre-long INS Tushil, reached her home port of Karwar from Russia on Feb 14. These four new warships will add to the six such Russian frigates, three Talwar-class and three Teg-class warships, already inducted in the Navy from 2003-2004 onwards.Designed for blue water operations across the spectrum of naval warfare in the four dimensions of air, surface, underwater and electromagnetic, these frigates are armed with a wide array of advanced weapon systems.The weapons include the Brahmos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450-km from the original 290-km, the vertically-launched Shtil surface-to-air missiles with enhanced ranges, and anti-submarine torpedoes and rockets, among others.Capable of achieving speeds of over 30 knots, the frigates can also carry the upgraded anti-submarine and airborne early warning helicopters, the Kamov-28 and Kamov-31, which are force multipliers in themselves. ""High degree of automation and stealth features, across radio, infrared, and acoustic spectrums, further enhance their combat capability and survivability,"" the officer said.","India will soon get its second powerful warship built in russia, a multi-role stealth frigate packed with weapons and sensors.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is continuing with its state policy of fuelling cross-border terrorism through state and non-state proxies, and attacks like Pahalgam destabilise and jeopardise regional peace and security, defence minister Rajnath Singh told his Japanese counterpart General Nakatani on Monday.With Pakistan on Saturday testing the 450-km Abdali ballistic missile system in a reckless, escalatory and provocative move, the delegation-level meeting saw India also point to Pakistan's active role in nuclear and missile proliferation, which is a source of insecurity and instability for countries around the world, sources told TOI.The meeting saw both sides condemn ""terrorism in all its forms"" and emphasised the need for enhanced global cooperation and joint efforts to counter cross-border threats. ""Nakatani San expressed solidarity with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and offered full support to India,"" Singh said.While the two ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the defence and security pillars of their bilateral 'special strategic and global partnership' and contribute towards regional peace, the major focus was on terrorism and Pakistan's role in promoting it.Singh condemned Pakistan's state policy of cross-border terrorism against India, perpetrated through state and non-state actors. He called for a unified stand against terrorism and the ""state-sponsored actions that perpetuate it"".Sources said the Indian side stressed that ""everyone needs to be mindful of the fact that terrorists coming out of terror training factories in Pakistan"" have committed attacks in several countries.Gen Nakatani, on his part, said terrorism could not be justified on any grounds, and Japan remained determined to resolutely fight the menace jointly with the international community, including India. He also expressed hope the countries concerned would take responsible actions for the sake of peace and stability in South Asia. On the proliferation front, China has played a major role in facilitating the clandestine network that has enabled Pakistan and North Korea to progressively strengthen their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals.India and Japan have full strategic convergence on China's aggressive expansionist moves in the Indo-Pacific region, and along with the other 'Quad' countries of the US and Australia have openly declared their intent to deter any coercion in the region. Japan regularly takes part in the top-tier Malabar naval exercise, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the US in 1992 but now includes all four 'Quad' countries.The two also conduct the Dharma Guardian exercise between their armies, JIMEX between navies and Veer Guardian between air forces, and have also operationalised their reciprocal military logistics pact. ""The ministers welcomed the growing diversity and frequency of defence exercises and exchanges, and concurred to enhance the scope and complexity of these engagements. They agreed to add new dimensions to the robust bilateral maritime cooperation,"" an official said. Singh also outlined the capability of the Indian defence industry, particularly its potential to collaborate with Japan on new areas like tank engines and aero engines. Both sides agreed to enhance industrial cooperation, including exploring collaboration in niche domains such as automation and AI, as also take forward the collaboration in emerging areas like cyber and space.","Pakistan is continuing with its state policy of fuelling cross-border terrorism through state and non-state proxies, defence minister rajnath singh told his japanese counterpart general nakatani on monday.

NEW DELHI:

Amid indications of an imminent confrontation with Pakistan, the govt on Monday moved to prepare the country for any contingency, with the home ministry asking all states and Union Territories to conduct civil defence exercises or drills across the country’s 244 categorised civil defence districts on Wednesday.The purpose of the exercise, which is bound to bring back memories of full-scale wars — with China in 1962 and Pakistan in 1965 and 1971 — is to test and enhance preparedness of the civil defence machinery against any hostile attacks. The 244 civil defence districts include those identified as vulnerable to various threats.The drills will simulate a warlike scenario, involving operationalisation of air raid warning sirens to test their effectiveness and activation of the hotline or radio communication links with the Indian Air Force. It will test the implementation of blackout measures, besides evaluating the option of early camouflaging of vital plants and installations.The May 7 exercise — which is bound to bring back memories of full-scale wars, with China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965 and 1971 — seeks to test functionality of control rooms and shadow control rooms and verify the activation and response of civil defence services, including warden services, firefighting, rescue operations and depot management.The communication to conduct civil defence exercises was sent to state chief secretaries and UT administrators by the directorate general, fire services, civil defence and home guards — which comes under the home ministry — on a day of intense deliberations by PM Narendra Modi with the national security adviser, the home secretary and the defence secretary.No exercise of this scale was undertaken during Operation Vijay launched to successfully evict Pakistani intruders in Kargil in 1999 or, before that, in 2001 when a war with Pakistan had looked imminent after India massed its troops along the border in the aftermath of a terror attack on Parliament.The primary objective of the security drill will also be training of civilians, students and volunteers in civil defence aspects to protect themselves from hostile situations; and to evaluate the preparedness of evacuation plans and rehearse their execution.An earlier communication sent to states on May 2 had sought strengthening of civil defence preparedness in “vulnerable areas”, while recalling the prime minister’s address at the ‘chintan shivir’ — attended by all state home ministers — held on Oct 27-28 at Surajkund, Haryana, emphasising the importance of civil defence preparedness in the country, especially in border and coastal areas. It had stressed on all aspects of preparedness as listed above, apart from cleaning of bunkers and trenches in the border areas.Monday’s communication is a follow up and states that the home ministry, in exercise of powers conferred on the MHA under Section 19 of the Civil Defence Rules, 1968, “has decided to organise civil defence exercise and rehearsal” right down to the village level.“In the civil defence exercise, active participation of the district controller, various district authorities, civil defence wardens/volunteers, home guards (active/reserve volunteers), National Cadet Corps (NCC), Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), National Service Scheme (NSS) and college/school students is envisaged,” the home ministry letter said, adding that the aim of the exercise is to “assess the operational efficacy and operational coordination of various civil defence measures”.The communication requests the director, civil defence of states and UTs to involve all stakeholders in the May 7 exercise across the 244 categorised civil defence districts and send an action taken report to DG, fire services, civil defence and home guards “at the earliest”.In a letter sent to state chief secretaries in Jan 2023 following the 2022 ‘chintan shivir’ at Surajkund, then home secretary Ajay Bhalla had underlined the vital role played by civil defence in supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens and helping the civil administration in discharge of their responsibilities. “However, new and complex threats/challenges are emerging, which may pose potential distress to civilian lives and livelihood during the hostile attack/internal security situations,” he had said while seeking a review and the civil defence set up in the states/UTs.","The purpose of the exercise is to test and enhance preparedness of the civil defence machinery against any hostile attacks.

""We once again call on the Canadian authorities to act against anti-India elements who spread hatred and advocate extremism and separatist agenda,"" the source further added.This tension emerged shortly after Mark Carney's electoral victory as Canadian Prime Minister.Carney, an economist new to politics, secured a remarkable win for the Liberal Party during elections held amidst US President Donald Trump's tariff disputes.His appointment presented a potential opportunity to improve India-Canada relations, which deteriorated significantly during Justin Trudeau's leadership.The bilateral relationship faced serious challenges following Trudeau's September 2023 claims about the ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death on Canadian soil. India firmly dismissed these allegations as ""absurd"".Relations worsened when Ottawa connected several Indian diplomats, including High Commissioner Sanjay Verma, to Nijjar's death. In October last year, India withdrew Verma and five colleagues, whilst expelling an equal number of Canadian diplomats from New Delhi.Recently, security officials from both nations resumed communications, exploring possibilities for appointing new high commissioners, reported news agency PTI.Trudeau's departure was viewed as a chance for diplomatic improvement. India had criticised Trudeau's administration for allowing pro-Khalistani groups to operate in Canada.Following Trudeau's exit, New Delhi expressed hopes to restore relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity"".","A parade on sunday reportedly displayed pro-khalistan propaganda and imagery targeting indian leaders.

SRINAGAR/JAMMU:

Authorities have since Sunday restricted flows through Jammu’s Baglihar and Salal hydroelectric dams on the Chenab that runs on to Pakistan, causing such an unprecedented drop in water levels that residents in downstream areas were able to walk across the river for the first time in recent memory.The actions demonstrate India’s ability to regulate timing of water releases and comes after the Centre’s decision to suspend Indus Water Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists. Under IWT, India would have had to inform Pakistan before regulating Chenab’s waters.Sources said the authorities had closed all five main gates of Baglihar Dam and those of Salal Dam downstream. Water released from Baglihar typically flows to Salal before the Chenab rolls into Pakistan, where it serves as a critical lifeline for its Punjab province. By closing both dams, authorities effectively stopped the river’s flow.Officials downplayed the moves, saying the dams’ gates were first opened to flush out silt and mud and then closed under a “continuous process”.In Jammu’s Akhnoor, dozens walked across the river, something they said they had never experienced before. Children collected coins from the bed as water levels dropped to 1.5-2ft from 25-30ft. “For the first time in my life today, I was able to walk across half the Chenab. It’s unbelievable,” an Akhnoor resident said on Monday.Many welcomed PM Narendra Modi’s decision to put IWT on hold. “We do not want even a single drop of water to be supplied to Pakistan. We stand with Indian Army and PM Modi,” said Akhnoor’s Vinay Gupta. Fellow resident Kamal Langer echoed the sentiment: “Our govt is giving Pakistan a befitting reply in a lot of ways.”According to Luv Puri, former UN counter-terrorism official and a Kashmir expert, the implications of placing IWT in abeyance are becoming increasingly evident. “It shows this was preceded by significant preparation,” Puri said.IWT gives India exclusive rights to use waters of “Eastern Rivers” -- Sutlej, Beas and Ravi -- and their tributaries before they enter Pakistan, while the latter secured rights over the waters of the “Western Rivers” -- Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.“Earlier analyses suggesting India lacked the infrastructure to exert pressure through water management have proven inaccurate. The impact of suspending IWT reveals that India has, in fact, developed the infrastructure needed to leverage water strategically,” Puri said.Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister and president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), had on Saturday reiterated his party’s opposition to IWT. He argued that the 1960 treaty had harmed J&K’s interests and called for diverting Chenab’s waters to Jammu and harnessing Jhelum’s waters to generate power in Kashmir. NC has long claimed that the rights over the region’s rivers were given to Pakistan under IWT without consulting J&K. “We have been saying that this treaty has to be reviewed,” Abdullah said.",Authorities have since sunday restricted flows through jammu's baglihar and salal hydroelectric dams on the chenab that runs on to pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind chief Arshad Madani on Sunday appeared to doubt the feasibility of the government's suspension of a river water treaty with Pakistan . Madani said rivers have been flowing for ""thousands of years"" and questioned where the water of these rivers will go.Following the recent attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam by Pakistan-backed terrorists, the government took various measures against Pakistan.

It's not easy,"" news agency ANI quoted Madani as saying.Madani further suggested that there should be a ""rule of love,"" and not hatred.""The rule should be of love and not hatred.

The country's politicians have been making provocative remarks on the subject.""Modi has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan. I want to tell India that the Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,"" Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Pakistan Peoples Party chief and ex-foreign minister, said days after India suspended the agreement.On Sunday, Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif, vowed his country would target ""any structure"" India builds on the Indus River.""Certainly, if they (India) attempt to build any kind of structure, we will strike it. Aggression is not just about firing cannons or bullets; it has many faces. One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst.

"Pahalgam attack: Putin agrees no compromise on terror, seeks action against perpetrators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pahalgam-attack-putin-agrees-no-compromise-on-terror-seeks-action-against-perpetrators/articleshow/120912126.cms,"No mention of restraint against Pak in Kremlin readout on talks

Agreeing with PM Narendra Modi on the need for an “uncompromising” fight against terrorism , Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call with PM Narendra Modi stressed that the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack and their supporters must be brought to justice.Putin, who had written to Modi on the day of the attack (April 22) expressing hope the perpetrators will get deserved punishment, strongly condemned the massacre in remarks seen as a strong endorsement of India’s position, at a time the Indian government is considering military options to defang the threat of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan.Putin’s remarks also came in the middle of calls by the West and India’s important Gulf partners for de-escalation and restraint. Russia’s own foreign minister Sergey Lavrov spoke to counterpart S Jaishankar last week and urged India to resolve “disagreements” diplomatically and politically, in line with the Simla Agreement that Pakistan has threatened to put in abeyance.There was no mention of restraint or use of diplomatic means in the Kremlin readout on this occasion as it said that Putin again expressed his sincere condolences over the death of Indian citizens because of the “barbaric terrorist attack” on April 22 in Pahalgam in southern Kashmir. “Both sides emphasized the need for an uncompromising fight against terrorism in all its manifestations,’’ it added.Expressing the same sentiment in its own version of the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) quoted Putin as emphasising that the perpetrators of the heinous attack and their supporters must be brought to justice. “President Putin called PM Narendra Modi and strongly condemned the terror attack in Pahalgam, India. He conveyed deepest condolences on the loss of innocent lives and expressed full support to India in the fight against terrorism,’’ said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Putin’s call for action against the perpetrators and their backers echoed US President Donald Trump’s initial reaction to the attack in which he expressed full support for India’s efforts to bring the Pahalgam terrorists to justice. In the past week or so, there has been pressure on India from the US to work with Pakistan for de-escalation, as evident from the State Department’s readout of secretary of state Marco Rubio’s last conversation with Jaishankar.In the talks on Monday, Modi also reiterated the invite for Putin to visit India for the annual India-Russia summit and the latter accepted it “with gratitude”. According to Russian authorities, the strategic nature of Russia-India relations as a special privileged partnership was emphasized. “These relations are not subject to external influence and continue to develop dynamically in all areas,’’ said the Russian readout.Modi also congratulated Putin for the upcoming May 9 Victory Day celebrations. Russia had invited Modi for the event, but the government had nominated defence minister Rajnath Singh to represent India. However, Singh’s junior minister Sanjay Seth will now visit Moscow as Singh stays put here in the middle of rising tensions with Pakistan.",No mention of restraint against pak in kremlin readout on talks between putin and modi.

NEW DELHI: Brutal killings of 26 civilians by Pakistani terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam have sharply escalated the tensions between India and Pakistan.Ex-Pakistan President Zia-ul-Haq's infamous and atrocious call to ""bleed India with a thousand cuts"" now seems to have boomeranged, with the central government taking big decisions and exploring key ways to punish Islamabad for orchestrating cross-border terrorism.Pakistan’s covert military strategy to weaken India through sustained proxy warfare, especially by supporting insurgencies and terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, now seems to have taken a massive hit.Just hours after the bloody attack, PM Modi cut short his Saudi Arabia visit and returned to India before chairing several key meetings with Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, NSA Ajit Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.Just a day after the attack, PM Modi held a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting, after which several big decisions were taken.The government, every day since April 22, has taken measures to push back against terrorism and its backers as India prepares to deliver a decisive blow to Islamabad's nefarious endeavours. In the most recent move, the MHA on Monday ordered the states to conduct civil defence mock drills.India suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a key water-sharing agreement mediated by the World Bank, which governs the distribution of the Indus River system. This strategic move halted cooperation on river water management, signalling a shift in India’s approach to bilateral agreements with Pakistan. The move is seen as a direct diplomatic pressure following the Pahalgam terror attack.The Wagah-Attari border crossing, a major point for trade and civilian transit between India and Pakistan, has been closed indefinitely. The ceremonial Beating Retreat parade has also been suspended. The closure is meant to isolate Pakistan further and reassert India's unwillingness to continue routine engagement in the face of terrorism.India formally downgraded diplomatic relations with Pakistan, significantly reducing the level of official engagement between the two countries. This includes recalling Indian diplomats, expelling senior Pakistani diplomats, and freezing diplomatic outreach.In a rare move, India declared several Pakistani military diplomats and intelligence officials persona non grata. They have been accused of engaging in activities incompatible with diplomatic status, including espionage.India has revoked all currently valid visas issued to Pakistani nationals, including those under the Saarc framework, citing national security concerns. The move disrupts cultural exchanges, academic visits, and business travel, and is meant to reduce potential security vulnerabilities by restricting entry of individuals from Pakistan during this heightened period of alert.Indian airspace has been closed to all Pakistani commercial aircraft, forcing them to take longer routes and suffer increased fuel and operational costs. This action disrupts Pakistan’s international air connectivity and has both symbolic and economic implications.The central government has completely severed formal trade relations with Pakistan, halting the import and export of goods. This includes both direct bilateral trade and third-country trade routed through the UAE or Singapore. Informal and cross-border trade via Jammu and Kashmir has also been shut down. The move is expected to economically strain certain sectors in Pakistan while reflecting India’s hardened stance against terrorism.All maritime shipping routes and logistics operations between India and Pakistan have been suspended. This includes container traffic, cargo ships, and joint maritime arrangements. Ports in Gujarat and Maharashtra that occasionally dealt with Pakistani-origin shipments have been notified. The decision impacts trade, humanitarian shipments, and port revenue but is viewed as a necessary strategic move to isolate Pakistan on multiple economic fronts.The Centre has ceased all postal services with Pakistan, including letters, parcels, and diplomatic pouches. This affects civilian communication and interrupts routine diplomatic correspondence. The move is aimed at applying pressure by cutting all non-essential contact points and signalling a total breakdown in bilateral trust following the terror attack in Pahalgam.The government has initiated a crackdown on Pakistani-origin digital and broadcast content. This includes restricting Pakistani news channels, removing YouTube videos, suspending social media pages linked to Pakistani propaganda, and warning OTT platforms against hosting such content. The move is seen as an attempt to curb misinformation, incitement, or glorification of terrorism and block narratives that may destabilise internal security or national morale.India has conducted closed-door briefings for members of the United Nations Security Council, excluding China and Pakistan, on Islamabad’s support for terrorist networks. The diplomatic effort aims to internationalise the issue and build a consensus on Pakistan’s role in cross-border terrorism. India presented evidence gathered from the Pahalgam attack site and intelligence reports to strengthen its case at the global stage.As India-Pakistan tensions escalate, the Narendra Modi government is taking steps to enhance the storage capacity at two hydroelectric facilities in Kashmir's Himalayan region, according to sources familiar with the situation who spoke to Reuters.This development marks India's first concrete action operating outside the framework of the Indus Waters Treaty, an agreement that has remained intact since 1960, despite three wars and various conflicts between the two nuclear-armed nations.India has demanded the Asian Development Bank to reduce funding for Pakistan, as New Delhi continued disciplinary measures against Islamabad. During the 58th Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Milan, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman urged ADB President Masato Kanda to reduce financial assistance to Pakistan, which was amongst several other topics addressed.The ministry of home affairs has directed several states to conduct civil defence mock drills on May 7. The exercise aims to enhance preparedness in the event of a hostile attack, and will include the following measures: Activation of air raid warning sirens, training civilians, including students, in basic civil defence techniques Implementation of crash blackout protocols, early-stage camouflaging of critical infrastructure and installations, updating and rehearsing evacuation plans.","Pakistan’s covert military strategy to weaken india through sustained proxy warfare now seems to have taken a massive hit. Pm modi cut short his saudi arabia visit and returned to india before chairing several key meetings with union home minister amit shah, defence minister rajnath singh, nsa ajit doval and external affairs minister s jaishankar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120903411,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"In closed-door meet, UNSC discusses faceoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-closed-door-meet-unsc-discusses-faceoff/articleshow/120911178.cms,"NEW DELHI: UN security council was scheduled to hold closed-door consultations on Monday on the rising India-Pakistan tensions , after Pakistan as a non-permanent member sought a meeting to brief member-states about what it described as India's aggressive behaviour. Pakistan has accused India of preparing to launch an attack on the country despite its own warmongering that has seen it test firing missiles twice in past few days.External affairs minister S Jaishankar has been in touch with council members, including Greece which holds the presidency of the council for May, to drive home India's point about Pakistan's use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy and to mobilise support for India's efforts to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam terrorist attack to justice.The UNSC closed-door consultations are of informal nature and unlikely to lead to any substantive outcome in this case - except allowing Pakistan a shot at diplomatic grandstanding - much like the closed consultations Islamabad sought through ally China in 2019 after India revoked the special status of J&K.The discussions - expected to begin around 12.30am IST Tuesday - will take place not under the India-Pakistan Question that involves J&K but the more generic ""threats to international peace and security"". Pakistan had said Sunday it will inform the council about how India's ""aggressive actions are jeopardising regional peace and security"". Pakistan is expected to raise the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty that India put in abeyance after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.While most council members have been supportive of India's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism, India remains wary of China's support to Pakistan in UNSC. This was obvious in the way Pakistan worked with China to water down the council's condemnation of the terrorist attack. Unlike its condemnation of the Pulwama attack in 2019, the council did not ask State to cooperate specifically with the Indian govt and didn't name the terror group that had taken responsibility for the attack.Pakistan said last week that as a member-state it has the right to convene a meeting when it feels appropriate because of the threat to regional and global peace.",Pakistan has accused india of preparing to launch an attack on the country.

NEW DELHI: The UN Security Council (UNSC) will hold closed consultations on Monday about the situation between India and Pakistan. Pakistan had asked for an emergency meeting on the issue. Pakistan is currently a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, which is being led by Greece for the month of May.Pakistan ""requested closed consultations"" over the growing tensions, and the Greek Presidency scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon.Pakistan said on Sunday that it will ""inform"" the UNSC about what it called India's ""aggressive actions"".""Pakistan will inform the UNSC about India's aggressive actions, provocations, and provocative statements,"" the Pakistan's foreign office said.""Pakistan will specifically highlight India's illegal actions to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty,"" it said, adding that the country would clarify how New Delhi's actions are jeopardising ""peace and security"" in the region.The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power: China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US.

A Conversation with Rahul Gandhi

'Ridiculed not just in India, but around the world': BJP

What happened in 1984?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , during his recent visit to the United States, faced pointed questions from a Sikh student regarding his party's historical relationship with the Sikh community , particularly concerning the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. While the exchange occurred on April 21, the video only emerged on May 3.The student questioned Rahul Gandhi's recent statements suggesting that Sikhs might face restrictions on wearing religious symbols like the kara and turban under the current BJP government. The student highlighted what he saw as a contradiction in Gandhi's stance on fearless politics, given the Congress party 's own complicated history with Sikh rights.“You talked about how politics should be fearless. There should be nothing to be afraid of, right? But we don’t just want to wear karas. We don’t just want to tie our turbans. We want freedom of expression, which under the Congress party in the past has not been allowed,” the student asserted.The student further referred to the sentencing of former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar, saying the party had failed to reconcile with the Sikh community after the 1984 violence. A Delhi court sentenced Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment on February 25 for leading a mob that killed two Sikhs in Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar during the 1984 riots .Gandhi responded by acknowledging his party's past mistakes, though noting they occurred before his time in politics.""A lot of those mistakes happened when I was not there. But I'm more than happy to take responsibility for everything that the Congress party has ever done wrong in its history,"" he stated. He also spoke about his personal connection with the Sikh community, mentioning his visits to the Golden Temple and publicly condemning the events of the 1980s.""I have publicly stated that what happened in the 80s was wrong. I have been to the Golden Temple multiple times. I have an extremely good relationship with the Sikh community in India and a loving relationship with them,"" the former Congress president said.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya shared a clip from the video, saying it was telling that Rahul Gandhi was being “mocked not just in India, but globally.” He added that the student had directly reminded Gandhi of the “unfounded fear-mongering” he had done about Sikh identity under BJP rule.""You haven’t reconciled with the Sikhs,” a young man tells Rahul Gandhi to his face, reminding him of the unfounded fear-mongering he engaged in during his last visit to the US. It is quite unprecedented that Rahul Gandhi is now being ridiculed not just in India, but around the world,"" he wrote. Operation Blue Star was launched in June 1984. Ordered by the government, it aimed to flush out armed Sikh militants led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The operation resulted in heavy casualties and significant damage to the gurdwara.Bhindranwale was killed during the assault. In a retaliatory act, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, sparking widespread anti-Sikh riots that killed thousands.",Congress mp rahul gandhi faced pointed questions from a sikh student regarding his party's historical relationship with the sikh community.

Wayne Gretzky's Donald Trump ties spark anger during politically sensitive moment

Hockey legend’s recent actions raise eyebrows north of the border

Wayne Gretzky , long celebrated as Canada ’s greatest hockey icon, is now facing an unfamiliar role—not on the ice, but in the center of a political firestorm. The backlash against “The Great One” has intensified in recent weeks as Canadians grapple with his increasingly visible friendship with former U.S. President Donald Trump The controversy erupted following Donald Trump’s recent interview with The Atlantic, where he addressed Wayne Gretzky’s situation head-on. “I love Canada,” Trump said, before revealing a private conversation with the hockey legend . “I said to Wayne, ‘I’m gonna give you a pass, Wayne… Just pretend you don’t know me.’” The remark, meant to shield Gretzky from the fallout, has only fueled the perception that the former NHL star is too close to a deeply unpopular figure in Canada.The timing of this revelation couldn’t be more explosive. Canadian political tensions with the U.S. are already at a boiling point. Donald Trump’s past statements suggesting Canada could become America’s 51st state, coupled with escalating trade wars and inflammatory rhetoric, have frayed nerves across the border. According to a Politico/Focaldata poll, 75% of Canadians hold an unfavorable view of President Trump.Wayne Gretzky’s decision to give a thumbs-up to American players and skip wearing Canadian colors during the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February didn’t go unnoticed. Critics saw the gesture as unpatriotic, especially after images surfaced of Gretzky donning a MAGA hat at Trump’s 2024 election celebration at Mar-a-Lago.
