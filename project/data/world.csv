"Big desi guns booming: CCS clears mega deal of Rs 7,000 crore for big indigenous artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/big-desi-guns-booming-ccs-clears-mega-deal-of-rs-7000-crore-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119278352.cms,"NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security Wednesday cleared the Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS) for the Army, in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers. The deal for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles, to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, will now be inked early next week.Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems will produce the ATAGS, the first indigenously designed and developed 155mm/52-calibre artillery gun by DRDO. Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns as it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%. “ATAGS will replace outdated 105mm and 130mm guns. It will enhance the Army’s operational capabilities along the borders with China and Pakistan with its cutting-edge technology and superior firepower,” an official said. “Over 65% of its components are sourced domestically, including key subsystems such as the barrel, muzzle brake, breech mechanism, firing and recoil system, & ammunition handling mechanism,” he added.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after the CCS clearance. Orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns. India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire fiveround bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenancefree reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said. ATAGS, development of which began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier. In Dec last year, for instance, defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T selfpropelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km & can be deployed in high-altitude areas along frontier with China.Then in Feb, MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive prefragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37km) for the indigenous Pinaka multilaunch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.","The pm-led cabinet committee on security cleared the rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems (atags) for the army.

"Modernisation proposals worth Rs 54,000 crore get ministry of defence’s initial nod",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modernisation-proposals-worth-rs-54000-crore-get-ministry-of-defences-initial-nod/articleshow/119278163.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Military modernisation proposals worth over Rs 54,000 crore, ranging from BrahMos missiles and six ‘Netra’ airborne earlywarning and control (AEW&C) aircraft to upgraded Russian engines for T-90 tanks, naval anti-aircraft missiles and torpedoes, were given preliminary nod by defence ministry on Thursday.Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) accorded “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” to additional Army regiments and IAF squadrons of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450km from the original 290km, worth around Rs 20,000 crore, sources told TOI.BrahMos missiles, jointly manufactured with Russia in India, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces, with contracts worth over Rs 55,000 crore already inked over the years. The grant of an AON, of course, is just the first step in the long-winded procurement procedure that can take years before the final contract is inked. Towards this end, DAC also approved guidelines to reduce timelines at various stages to make the process “faster, more effective and efficient”.Another key takeaway was the fresh AoN granted for six ‘Netra’ AEW&C Mark-1A aircraft or “eyes in the sky” for IAF to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets.The new Netra aircraft, which will entail mounting indigenous active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets, will cost over Rs 9,000 crore. With IAF currently making do with just three Netra Mark-1 planes and three Israeli ‘Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft, India is lagging far behind Pakistan, let alone China, in this arena.The Navy, in turn, got AoNs for additional indigenous shiplaunched Varunastra torpedoes and Russian Shtil antiaircraft missiles for its four 3,900-tonne upgraded Krivak-III class frigates. While the first frigate INS Tushil has sailed to India from Russia, the second will come later this year.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at a cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. AoN was also granted for procurement of 1,350 horsepower engines from Russia for T-90S ‘Bhishma’ mainbattle tanks, which currently have 1000 HP engines. The force has inducted around 1,300 T-90S tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia. “The engine upgrade will enhance the battlefield mobility of these tanks especially in high-altitude areas by increasing the power to weight ratio,” an official said.","Brahmos missiles, jointly manufactured with russia in india, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces.

How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big indian carriers like air india group and indigo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from mumbai’s chatrapati shivaji maharaj international airport (csmia) when the latter gets operational later this summer.

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the south and east china seas as well as the taiwan strait to push its territorial claims.

“Deal very shortly…”, Prez Trump shares major update on mineral deal | Ukraine-Russia Peace Deal

US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the US would be finalising an agreement with Ukraine regarding access to its rare earth minerals.During his White House speech, Trump confirmed signing a directive to ""dramatically increase"" US production of critical minerals and indicated an imminent agreement with Ukraine.""We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths and minerals and lots of other things all over the world, but in particular Ukraine,"" he said. Confirming the intention to sign the deal, trump added, ""One of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine, which they have tremendous value in rare earths, and we appreciate that.""Trump has been urging his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to establish economic agreements to balance American support in Ukraine's defence against Russian invasion.He specifically targeted Ukraine's mineral resources. The country possesses five percent of global mineral deposits, including iron, manganese, titanium, lithium and uranium.Although Ukraine has deposits of ""rare earths"", which comprise 17 specific metals within the broader critical minerals category, none are currently under commercial extraction, as reported by AFP .Last month, Zelenskyy refused to approve an agreement allowing US mining companies access to mineral developments, citing inadequate protection against continued Russian military actions. Nevertheless, Trump has maintained his advocacy for a temporary cessation of hostilities.The proposed critical mineral deal between the US and Ukraine aims to grant the US access to Ukraine’s vast reserves of essential minerals like titanium and lithium, crucial for industries such as artificial intelligence, defense, and clean energy. Under the agreement, Ukraine would contribute 50% of revenues from newly developed mineral assets, oil, and natural gas into a joint investment fund to attract private sector investment and aid in Ukraine’s reconstruction.The deal collapsed during a February meeting at the White House after tensions flared between Trump and Zelenskyy. Trump pressured Zelenskyy to secure US access to these resources in exchange for continued military aid, while Zelenskyy pushed for explicit security guarantees—something the deal did not provide. A heated exchange in the Oval Office led to Zelenskyy’s early departure without signing the agreement, cancelling the planned press conference and signing ceremony. The breakdown underscored Trump’s prioritization of resource access over unconditional support, straining US-Ukraine relations amid the ongoing war with Russia.Read more: How Trump-Vance-Zelenskyy dispute led to the collapse of a critical mineral deal","Us president donald trump announced on thursday that the us would be finalising an agreement with ukraine regarding access to its rare earth minerals.

FBI shares tips for travelers to stay safe over spring break



Establish points of contact for your family to reference in the event of an emergency.

Avoid traveling alone, especially after dark. Be conscious of your surroundings and avoid areas you believe may put your personal safety at risk.

Use only authorized taxis/shuttles. Passengers have been robbed or kidnapped when using taxis.

Avoid actions that are illegal, improper, or indiscreet. Avoid offers of sexual companionship; they may lead to a room raid, photography, and blackmail.

Evade criminals by being aware of your surroundings and alert to the possibility of surveillance. Take mental notes of anyone following you and promptly report it to the appropriate security officials.

Beware of new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.

""Whether it’s families looking to escape the final throes of winter or a college student seeking a brief respite from the rigors of academic life, know that the risks are there,"" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said in a statement. ""Maintain vigilance throughout your travels and be prepared to contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate should the need arise.""In the Caribbean, Haiti has the highest and level 4 travel advisory, meaning ""do not travel,"" followed by Jamaica at level 3, which means US citizens should ""reconsider travel.""Sudiksha's parents initially suspected foul play and insisted that she could not drown. Joshua Riibe, a 24-year-old man from Iowa, who was last seen with Konanki was detained and questioned. He said he went to the sea with Konanki when they were caught in strong waves. He fought against the waves and pulled Konanki out of the rough waters and then passed out on the shores. He said when he woke up in the morning, Konanki was not there. Konanki's parents now believe Riibe was not involved in any foul play and they thanked him for cooperation in the probe following which Riibe was allowed to come back home from DR.","Sudiksha konanki, 20, went missing in dominican republic.

I would always love to follow it on the TV at home. I don’t think that Sophia has seen any of my vlogs, so yeah, she is like the number one ‘unsupporter’ over here. It’s be like, ‘How could you not have seen a single one’?” Isabella joked. While it’s hard to imagine fighting cancer without full support from a twin, it’s clear that their relationship is built on playful honesty and deep love.After receiving her diagnosis in October 2023, Isabella decided to open up about her health journey through a YouTube vlog channel.

I want to feel normal. Nothing about my life right now is normal.'"" Sophia explained, ""I think something that I tried to do best was to make her feel normal."" Her unwavering support and efforts to create a sense of normalcy tells us the powerful bond between the Strahan sisters during Isabella’s challenging journey.","Michael strahan’s daughter opens up about feeling 'unsupported' by her twin sister during cancer recovery journey.

JD Vance Kamala Harris: JD Vance says he doesn't have 'four shots of vodka' before every meeting unlike Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-says-he-doesnt-have-four-shots-of-vodka-before-every-meeting-unlike-kamala-harris/articleshow/119265773.cms,"JD Vance jokes that unlike Kamala Harris, he does not have 'four shots of vodka' before meetings.

Vice President JD Vance confirmed what has been there in the form of rumors, trolling and speculations that former vice president Kamala Harris was always 'high as a kite'. However, JD Vance's statement also came in the form of a joke when he was asked how he does things differently from his predecessor. ""Well, I don’t have four shots of vodka before every meeting,” Vance laughed in an interview with radio host and Daily Caller editorial director Vince Coglianese.“That’s one way that I think Kamala really tried to bring herself into the role, is these word salads,” Vance added, “and I think that I would need the help of a lot of alcohol to answer a question like Kamala Harris answered a question.”Apart from her 'word salads' which are a collection of high-sounding words strung together signifying nothing, Kamala Harris is often trolled for the singsong tone in which she speaks which people think is because of her alleged day drinking problem. Several of her appearances struck social media users as being 'drunk' though there is no report confirming any type of alcohol abuse the former vice president may have had.In one of her interviews during the campaigning, Kamala Harris cracked open a Miller High Life beer can with Stephen Colbert which was seen as a cool gesture for a presidential nominee as Joe Biden and Donald Trump are known to be teetotallers.JD Vance too was seen drinking a beer with supporters during the campaigning. He said he liked beer a little bit too much.Kamala Harris' latest public appearance was at an AI conference where she talked about innovation but ended up talking about her famous Doritos with DoorDash serving as the innovation link.“We did DoorDash ’cause I wanted Doritos. And the red carpet part was about to start and nobody wanted to leave to go to the grocery store. So it was DoorDash … So I was willing to give up whatever might be the tracking of Kamala Harris’ particular fondness for nacho cheese Doritos for the sake of getting a big bag of Doritos as I watched the Oscars,” she began.“And that’s right. But here’s the thing: At what point do we also uplift and highlight the consumer’s right to also expect — and you can debate with me if it should be a right — I think it should,” Harris said making many to believe that she was three glasses of wines deep.","Jd vance jokes that unlike kamala harris, he does not have 'four shots of vodka' before meetings.
