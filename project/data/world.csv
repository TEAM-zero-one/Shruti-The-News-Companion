Gold and silver price prediction today:MCX Gold prices are currently trading around the ₹1,27,000 mark, reflecting strong bullish momentum. On the international front, COMEX gold is comfortably holding above the $4,000 level, further reinforcing the positive trend. This price behaviour indicates that gold is consistently forming higher lows, which is a classic sign of strength in technical analysis. The ability to protect previous support levels suggests that buyers are active at lower levels, absorbing selling pressure and preparing for potential upside moves.From a short-term trading perspective, gold prices have the potential to move towards the ₹1,30,000 level if the current momentum continues. Traders can consider accumulating positions near the ₹1,26,000 support zone, where buying interest has previously emerged. A strong support base is seen at ₹1,23,500, and any dip toward this level may offer a good risk-reward entry for bullish positions.Given the ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary concerns, and a weak global economic outlook, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset.These factors are likely to keep demand strong and prices buoyant in the near term. As long as prices sustain above the key support levels, the outlook for gold remains optimistic with further upside potential.MCX Silver has shown significant strength and has outperformed MCX Gold in recent sessions, currently trading around ₹1,60,000 levels. This rally reflects robust bullish sentiment driven by a combination of industrial demand, investment interest, and a positive technical setup. Silver's strong price action suggests that market participants are confident in its upside potential, especially as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows, a clear sign of an ongoing uptrend.Compared to gold, silver tends to exhibit more volatility, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. Any corrective move or dip toward the ₹1,57,000 level can be seen as a buying opportunity, supported by strong demand and momentum. On the upside, prices have the potential to move toward ₹1,63,000 in the near term. Traders should maintain a stop-loss at ₹1,54,000 to manage risk effectively in case of unexpected price reversals.Silver's dual role as both a precious and industrial metal makes it a favored asset in times of economic uncertainty, as well as during periods of industrial recovery. With favorable fundamentals and technical strength, silver remains well-positioned for further gains, and buying on dips strategy could prove rewarding in the current market environment.","Gold and silver prices are exhibiting strong bullish momentum.

What is the case against Mehul Choksi?



A Belgian court on Friday ordered the extradition of fugitive Mehul Choksi to India, news agency PTI reported citing officials. Choksi faces charges related to the massive Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case.""The order has come in our favour. The court has termed his arrest by the Belgian authorities on India's request valid. The first legal step in getting him extradited is now clear,"" a senior official told PTI.Officials stated that the order marks a significant validation of India's efforts to secure Mehul Choksi's extradition, although he still has the option to appeal the decision in a higher Belgian court. Prosecutors argued before the court that Choksi poses a flight risk and should not be released from custody, the officials told PTI.Choksi, who relocated to Belgium in 2023 after leaving Antigua and Barbuda, was arrested there in April following India’s extradition request. He and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused of defrauding the bank of over Rs 13,000 crore.India had earlier assured Belgian authorities that if extradited, Choksi will be housed in Barrack No. 12 at Arthur Road jail, Mumbai, with adequate space and no risk of overcrowding or solitary confinement.The Union home ministry, in a September 4 communique, confirmed that the cell meets the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of Europe’s minimum space standards.Choksi fled to Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship, before being apprehended in Belgium. India’s agencies swiftly coordinated to secure his extradition. The cell assigned to Choksi measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, with a separate toilet, ventilation, and security measures. Inmates receive daily cleaning, fresh water, outdoor exercise, board games, yoga sessions, and access to media and telemedicine. Weekly family visits and daily legal consultations are permitted.Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in a Rs 13,000 crore fraud involving fraudulent Letters of Undertaking issued by Punjab National Bank. Nirav Modi, a declared fugitive economic offender, is currently jailed in London and contesting extradition. The CBI’s extradition request cites the UN conventions against corruption and organised crime, supported by arrest warrants from Mumbai courts. The fraud involved PNB issuing 165 LoUs and 58 Foreign Letters of Credit in 2017 without limits or proper records, leading to massive losses covered by the bank.Authorities allege that loans were obtained from overseas banks across locations including Mauritius, Hong Kong, Antwerp, and Frankfurt based on these fraudulent guarantees. When the companies failed to repay, PNB was forced to pay over Rs 6,300 crore, including interest, to these foreign banks.","Belgian court clears fugitive jeweller mehul choksi's extradition to india.

Operation Sindoor was one such mission. HAL provided 24x7 support at operational sites, ensuring the IAF’s readiness by maintaining fighter jets and helicopters. The Nashik team’s installation of the BrahMos missile on the Su-30, which destroyed terrorist hideouts, proved that we can design, build, and defend ourselves with our own systems,” he said.He described the Tejas-Mk1A’s flight as a “shining symbol of India’s growing Aatmanirbharta in defence” and praised HAL for transforming itself into the backbone of the sector.Pointing to the defence sector’s transformation over the past decade, Singh said India, which once imported 65–70% of its military hardware, now manufactures about 65% of it domestically.Defence production, he said, had risen from Rs 46,429 crore in 2014–15 to Rs 1.5-lakh-crore in 2024–25, while exports had climbed from less than Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore.The govt now aims for Rs 3-lakh-crore in production and Rs 50,000 crore in exports by 2029.He urged HAL to expand its innovation into next-generation aircraft, unmanned systems, and civil aviation. “Modern warfare is evolving rapidly with artificial intelligence, drones, and cyber technologies. India must stay ahead in this race,” he said.Secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar said the inauguration of the two (HTT-40 and LCA) production lines in Nashik marks “a new chapter in India’s technological confidence and industrial strength.”He added: “The Tejas-Mk1A is not just a fighter aircraft, but a statement of India’s design and manufacturing excellence—conceived, developed and produced indigenously through collaboration between HAL, ADA, DRDO, and the IAF.”HAL CMD DK Sunil said the Nashik division’s expansion had created about 1,000 jobs and developed over 40 industry partners. “Our capacity to produce advanced indigenous fighters in addition to the Su-30Mki gives fresh momentum to delivery timelines and reinforces our public-private partnerships,” he said.The event also featured a Tejas Mk1A sortie piloted by HAL chief test pilot (fixed wing) Group Captain (retd) KK Venugopal, followed by aerial displays by Su-30Mki and HTT-40 aircraft.",Defence minister rajnath singh said india’s defence ecosystem had demonstrated its growing confidence in indigenous platforms.

How a social media rumor spiraled out of control

Super Bowl SHOCK: Turning Point USA Plots Its OWN Halftime Show Amid Bad Bunny Drama

Adam Sandler remains focused on comedy and film, not politics

A bizarre viral rumor suggesting that Adam Sandler was set to perform at Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show has officially been debunked. The claim, which spread rapidly across Facebook and X (formerly Twitter), alleged that the comedian would headline a rival event to the Super Bowl halftime show, but fact-checkers and sources close to Sandler have confirmed that the story is entirely fabricated.The rumor began earlier this week after a series of misleading Facebook posts claimed that “Adam Sandler will join Lara Trump at the Turning Point USA halftime show.” The posts racked up thousands of shares within hours, with users debating whether Sandler had shifted toward political performances. However, no reputable news outlet, nor Turning Point USA itself, ever announced his involvement.According to media watchdog Primetimer, the rumor stemmed from a manipulated headline that mixed genuine coverage of Lara Trump’s recent offer to perform at the event with false claims about Sandler’s participation. The viral graphic even used a photo of Sandler from his Netflix stand-up special, adding to the illusion of authenticity.Fact-checkers later confirmed that Sandler has no known ties to Turning Point USA or its founder Charlie Kirk , and he has never publicly expressed interest in performing at political events.In reality, Sandler’s current schedule is packed with promotional appearances for his upcoming Netflix sequel “Happy Gilmore 2” and a new family comedy project set for release in 2026.Sources close to the actor emphasized that he’s steering clear of politically charged platforms. “He’s focused on creative projects and touring, not partisan events,” one insider told Primetimer.This isn’t the first time Sandler has been the subject of viral misinformation. Earlier this year, fake posts alleged that he had exchanged texts with Charlie Kirk and criticized late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, both of which were later proven false.Also Read: Will Jennifer Lopez join Bad Bunny at the Super Bowl halftime show?

Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?

What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?

The ’ clash with the took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run. In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE.”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability.”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon kobylarczyk, a milwaukee-based attorney, worked at manpowergroup, a global staffing firm.

Marcus Mariota’s career earnings: From Titans to Commanders

Marcus Mariota has been in the spotlight since his first NFL snap. Back in 2015, the Oregon Ducks star stunned fans with a record-setting debut, throwing four touchdowns and finishing with a perfect passer rating of 158.3. That performance made him the first player since 1933 to hit that mark in his first game. Even with all the hype, Mariota downplayed the moment, saying, “We have to find ways to get better.” Now, after more than a decade in the league, the Washington Commanders quarterback is still collecting big checks.In 2025, Marcus Mariota’s net worth stands at $75,541,683. The number reflects his steady run of NFL salaries, bonuses, and endorsements. He once ranked 83rd on Forbes’ list of highest-paid athletes, pulling in $23.9 million in 2020 alone. That season, $20.9 million came directly from NFL salary and winnings, while $3 million came through endorsement deals.Fast forward to today, Mariota is in his second season with the Washington Commanders. After working as a backup to Jayden Daniels last year, he signed a fresh one-year, $8 million contract in March 2025.The deal includes a $5.5 million signing bonus, $7.39 million guaranteed, and carries an $8.08 million cap hit. According to Spotrac, his dead cap value sits at $7.49 million. Even as a backup, Mariota’s bank account shows he remains a valuable veteran presence.Mariota’s 2025 pay package is structured in layers. His base salary is $1.89 million, with $2 million in possible incentives and another $1 million as a workout bonus. When all is added up, the Commanders are investing heavily in their QB2.Looking back, his salary journey tells the story of a long NFL grind. With the Commanders in 2024, he made $6 million plus $3 million in bonuses. A year earlier with the Eagles, he took home $5 million and $3.8 million in bonuses. His biggest checks came during his Tennessee Titans run (2015–2019), when he banked $6.05 million in salary and $15.9 million in bonuses. In total, Mariota’s career earnings now hit $83 million. That number got a huge boost in 2019 when the Titans gave him a $20 million base, which alone makes up nearly 20% of his career income.Also read: Seahawks dealing with key injuries as Saints look for edge in Week 3","Washington commanders quarterback marcus mariota has a net worth of $75,541,683.

Pakistan Seeks Trump’s Intervention After Afghan-Taliban Forces Humiliate Pak Army In Border Clash





Pakistani airstrikes hit Afghanistan’s Paktika province, with attacks reportedly targeting residential homes in Argun and Barmal districts, according to Tolo News. A Taliban official speaking to news agency AFP confirmed the strikes saying that the ""truce has been broken"" by Islamabad.""Pakistan has broken the ceasefire and bombed three locations in Paktika"" the official told AFP adding that, ""Afghanistan will retaliate.""This comes hours after reports that the temporary ceasefire between Afghanistan and Pakistan was extended.A senior diplomatic source quoted by Pakistan's Dawn news had confirmed that the ceasefire, which was set to expire Friday evening, had been extended until the conclusion of the Doha negotiations.A 48-hour ceasefire was agreed between Afghanistan and Pakistan following deadly violence between the neighbouring countries.The truce, which began on Wednesday at 6:00 pm Islamabad time, temporarily halted nearly a week of intense border clashes that had already claimed dozens of lives, including civilians and soldiers on both sides.The violence began escalating on Saturday, following explosions in Kabul just as the Taliban's foreign minister embarked on a historic visit to India.In response, the Taliban launched an offensive along its southern border with Pakistan, prompting Islamabad to vow a forceful retaliation.Pakistani foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan stated that it was essential to ""wait for 48 hours"" to see if the ceasefire held, although no further details were provided. Meanwhile, Taliban authorities remained silent when asked for comment on the situation post-ceasefire.Security concerns remain at the heart of the dispute, with Pakistan accusing Afghanistan of harbouring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul denies. Khan added that Pakistan expects ""concrete and verifiable actions"" from the Taliban to combat these groups operating from Afghan soil.Meanwhile, a deadly attack in Pakistan's North Waziristan district claimed the lives of seven paramilitary troops just before the truce ended, with a faction of the TTP claiming responsibility. The ceasefire's expiration also coincided with a deadly bombing and gun attack in Mir Ali, Pakistan, where at least one soldier was killed in the ensuing shootout.","Pakistani airstrikes hit afghanistan’s paktika province, with attacks reportedly targeting residential homes in argun and barmal districts.
