NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Donald Trump and Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for their efforts to end the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflictIn his first public reaction on Ukraine's willingness to negotiate a ceasefire, Putin said that he agrees with the proposal of ceasefire but ""proceeds from the assumption that this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of the crisis.""""We all have enough of our own domestic affairs to attend to. But many leaders of states, among them the President of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of India, the Presidents of Brazil and the Republic of South Africa are addressing this issue and give it a lot of their time,"" Putin said during a joint press conference with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko.""We are grateful to all of them for that because this activity is aimed at achieving a noble mission - the mission of ending hostilities and loss of life,"" he added.Putin said that Russia agrees to the ceasefire proposal by the United States but argued that some issues still need to be addressed.""We agree with the proposal for a ceasefire (with Ukraine) to cease hostilities, but we proceed from the fact that this ceasefire should lead to an enduring peace, and should remove the root causes of this crisis,"" Putin said during a news conference with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.This came a day after Trump said that ""it’s up to Russia now"" as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire, following peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials that resulted in Kyiv agreeing to a 30-day US-backed ceasefire covering the entire frontline.Putin questioned what a ceasefire would mean in light of the recent Ukrainian ""incursion"" in Kursk. ""Would that mean that everybody there would leave? Should we release them after they have committed numerous crimes against civilians there, or will the Ukrainian leadership command them to surrender? What will happen? That’s not clear,"" he said.Earlier, Putin had named India among the three countries he is constantly in touch over the Ukraine conflict and said they are sincerely making efforts to resolve it.In July last year, PM Modi travelled to Russia to participate in the 22nd India-Russia Bilateral Summit. He also travelled to Ukraine in August last year.During the bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, PM Modi emphasised India's position of peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.PM Modi also welcomed Trump's efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict and reiterated India's position that the conflict should be resolved on the negotiating table.""I have always been in close contact with Russia and Ukraine. I have met the leaders of both countries. Many people are in a misconception that India is neutral, but I want to reiterate that India is not neutral; we are on a side, and that is peace,"" PM Modi said in a joint presser at the White House.He further reiterated India's position that a solution to the conflict can't be found on the battlefield and appreciated President Donald Trump's efforts in this direction.""I have said that 'this is not a time of war' in front of the media when President Putin was with me. Even today, my conviction is that the solutions to war cannot be found on the battlefield, and ultimately, we have to be at the table,"" PM Modi said.He added, ""India believes that the solution to the war can be found only when the issue is discussed in a forum where both countries (Russia and Ukraine) will be present. The efforts made by President Trump - I support, and welcome it. I hope he succeeds as soon as possible.""","Russian president vladimir putin thanked prime minister narendra modi, us president donald trump and brazil president luiz inacio lula da silva for their efforts to end the ongoing russia-ukraine conflict.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York.

NEW DELHI: After Airtel and Jio announced partnerships with Starlink in the last couple of days, opposition Congress and CPM on Thursday raised national security concerns and the former alleged that the deals were “orchestrated” by PM Narendra Modi “to buy goodwill” with US President Donald Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Airtel and Jio had announced partnerships with Starlink within 12 hours of each other, seemingly overcoming their objections to its entry into India.“It is abundantly clear that these partnerships have been orchestrated by none other than the PM himself to buy goodwill with President Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk,” he alleged.“But many questions remain. Perhaps the most important one relates to national security. Who will have the power to switch connectivity on or off when national security demands it? Will it be Starlink or its Indian partners? Will other satellite-based connectivity providers also be permitted and on what basis?” Ramesh asked on X.He added that the much larger question of Tesla manufacturing in India remained unanswered. “Is there some commitment to it now that Starlink’s entry into India has been facilitated,” he asked.Pointing out that “Supreme Court had held in the 2G case that spectrum is a scarce resource and can be allocated to private players only through open, transparent auction”, the CPM politburo said, “Any private deal for allocating spectrum would be a violation of the law of the land.Jio, Airtel and Starlink coming together to form a cartel to dominate satellite spectrum use will be at the cost of millions of telecom subscribers in India.” CPM added that satellite spectrum should be allocated exclusively for strategic uses, such as defence and Isro operations.The party said telecom services were critical for a country’s defence. “It is now known that US threats to stop Starlink services to Ukraine military forced Zelensky to concede US demands on handing over its natural resources and negotiating with Russia under US aegis,” it added.",Airtel and jio announced partnerships with starlink in the last couple of days.

NEW DELHI: Diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh may have nose-dived since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last year, but the military relationship continues as before. The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the Bay of Bengal this week.The bilateral 'Bongosagar’ exercise, in which Indian destroyer INS Ranvir and Bangladeshi frigate BNS Abu Ubaidah took part, facilitated “collaborative responses to shared maritime challenges” and enhanced interoperability between the two navies, an officer said on Thursday.The latest edition of the annual exercise, which began in 2019, involved a range of complex operations encompassing surface firing, tactical manoeuvres, underway replenishment, communication drills, and VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure) operations.“The exercise provided a wonderful opportunity for both navies to develop closer links in tactical planning, coordination and information sharing for undertaking seamless maritime operations,” the official said.“The enhanced synergy of operations between the two navies is a testament to the shared commitment of countering global security challenges towards enhancing security and stability in the region,” he added.India has steadily stepped-up military ties with Bangladesh, which incidentally acquired its first-ever diesel-electric submarines from China a few years ago, to counter Beijing’s strategic inroads into the country. Around 50-60 Bangladesh Army officers, for instance, attend specialized courses in Indian military establishments every year.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had recently said that India and Bangladesh consider each other “strategically important” neighbours and any kind of “animosity” between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is “very strong” and “we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,” he said.Gen Dwivedi, however, had expressed “concern” over reports that a Pak Army-ISI delegation recently visited areas in Bangladesh close to the `Chicken's Neck’ or the Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal.“I had used the word epicenter of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it. That they should not be able to use that soil to send terrorists to India,” he said.Also read: 'Sheikh Hasina coming back as PM': Awami League leader thanks India, says Bangladesh youth 'made mistake'","The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the bay of bengal.

NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.","Modi also advanced the vision of ‘mahasagar’ ( mutual and holistic advancement for security and growth across regions) for the global south.

NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt.These include the plane-loads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration . Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past.For India, whether it’s a million or a few thousand, there’s no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification. While extremely large figures — ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 — have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the govt has maintained it has no data about the number of “undocumented” Indian immigrants residing in the US.“The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,’’ said minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in the Rajya Sabha earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an “unambiguous” verification of their nationality.India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number (2,042) in 2019. Last year, it took back 1,368 illegal Indians. For the Indian govt, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry.He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration on the basis of information provided by the deportees.","India has identified 388 illegal indian immigrants in the us since president donald trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average pm2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) it was more than 25 times higher than who-recommended level and over three times more than indian ambient air quality standards.

Pakistan hints at India role in deadly train hijacking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-hints-at-india-role-in-deadly-train-hijacking/articleshow/118990844.cms,"AI generative photo

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has hinted at India being behind the train hijacking in Balochistan this week, saying the handlers of the attackers were based in Afghanistan and were allegedly sponsored by India.On Thursday, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said Islamabad had evidence that calls related to the hijacking originated in Afghanistan. Asked by reporters whether Islamabad had shifted its stance from India to Afghanistan over involvement in terrorist attacks on Pakistan, he said, “There is no shift in our policy. And again, the facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said.”Since the start of the attack on Tuesday Pakistan’s military, govt and media supporters have been blaming India without directly naming it in connection with the train assault, while keeping mum about grave security failures on the parts of the country’s military and intelligence authorities.While India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s latest allegations, Afghanistan’s foreign affairs ministry issue a statement, saying: “We categorically reject baseless allegations by the Pakistani army spokesman linking the attack on a passenger train in Balochistan province with Afghanistan, & urge Pakistani side to focus on resolving their own security & internal problems instead of such irresponsible remarks.”The Jaffar Express, carrying over 450 passengers, was seized by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, on March 11, leading to a deadly confrontation that left 58 dead, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and all 33 militants.Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan by backing groups like the BLA, a charge New Delhi dismisses as baseless. The latest claim comes as the BLA ramps up its campaign against the state, with the train hijacking marking a bold escalation in tactics.Analysts see it as part of a broader wave of militancy straining Pakistan’s security apparatus. Some observers said the Balochistan insurgency , fuelled by local grievances over poverty and political exclusion, has persisted for decades, casting doubt on the need for external provocation. “The BLA doesn’t require foreign sponsors to act but blaming India fits a familiar narrative here,” said Islamabad-based journalist Nazrul Islam.Relations between Pakistan and India, already frigid since the 2019 Pulwama attack, remain on edge, with little prospect of dialogue. For now, the Jaffar Express incident stands as a grim reminder of the region’s volatility, and the enduring rift between Islamabad and New Delhi.",Pakistan has hinted at india being behind the train hijacking in balochistan.

Taylor’s newfound romance with Aaron Pierre has also been the talk of the town amid the divorce settlement buzz.

Wayne Gretzky was sued for $10M over alleged false claims about a Weight Loss Gum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-was-sued-for-10m-over-alleged-false-claims-about-a-weight-loss-gum/articleshow/118879580.cms,"Image via TNT

What are the allegations of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Wayne Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Wayne Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Wayne Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

US Canada: New rule for Canadians staying in the US for over 30 days amid Donald Trump's tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-rule-for-canadians-staying-in-the-us-for-over-30-days-amid-donald-trumps-tariff-war/articleshow/118984223.cms,"Canadians staying in the US will now have to register themselves with the authorities.

Will Canadians require a visa for the US?



Tariff war triggers new rule for Canadians?



Amid Donald Trump's ongoing tariff war with Canada, the US government has come up with a new rule for Canadians who are in the United States for 30 days or longer and those who have crossed the land border. Starting on April 11, Canadians who plan to stay in the US for longer than 30 days will be required to apply for registration and be fingerprinted. So far, Canadians have been exempt from both rules which apply to other foreign nationals.Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government. However, the new rule would require them to fill out a different form to enter the US, which is not a visa. Canadians never needed any form or visa to enter the US for casual travelling, tourism, shopping etc.Those violating the rule may face fines of up to $5,000, six months in jail or both, according to the Federal Register, which was updated with the new guidance Wednesday.The new policy for Canadians is tied to President Donald Trump's executive order 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion' that he signed on the first day in the White House. The order is aimed at curbing ""the unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States"".According to Statistics Canada, 4.1 million Canadian residents arrived from trips abroad in December 2024. Of those, 2.1 million arrived from the United States by car, and 68.3% of those trips were taken within the same day.Reports said the new requirement is rooted in existing immigration law which states that foreign nationals of 14 or older and not already registered with American authorities have to register and fingerprinted if they plan to be in the US for 30 days or longer, but these rules were never applied to Canadians entering the US via land borders.It's now that the administration is moving to implement these rules for Canadians as Trump is engaged in a bitter trade war with Canada. The tariff war is now paused as both sides decided to sit across the table to address the situation.","Canadians staying in the us will now have to register themselves with the authorities.

Who is David Weldon?



David Weldon, 71, is an internal medicine physician best known for serving as a congressional representative for a central Florida district from 1995 to 2009.

Though he maintained a relatively low profile in recent years, he resurfaced in the public eye when President Trump nominated him for CDC director in November.

Weldon's stance on vaccines made him a favored candidate among allies of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Secretary of Health and Human Services.

He has expressed skepticism toward established vaccine science, and as recently as 2019, he promoted the unsubstantiated theory that vaccines could cause autism.

In 2007, Weldon co-authored a "" vaccine safety bill"" alongside former Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney.

bill"" alongside former Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. The proposed bill aimed to ""provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, free from conflict of interest criticism, and broadly accepted by the public at large,"" Weldon said in a press release announcing the bill.

The White House has withdrawn US President Donald Trump's nomination of former Florida representative Dr David Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as announced by the Republican-controlled Senate health committee on Thursday.The decision to withdraw the nomination came less than an hour before he was set to appear before the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for his confirmation hearing.The decision was made because Weldon lacked the necessary votes for confirmation, two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.Earlier, Senator Patty Murray, a health committee member, expressed grave concerns about Weldon following their meeting. ""I was deeply disturbed to hear Dr Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines,"" the Democrat said in a statement.""It's dangerous to put someone in charge at CDC who believes the lie that our rigorously tested childhood vaccine schedule is somehow exposing kids to toxic levels of mercury or causing autism,"" Murray continued.""As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,"" she added.Weldon is the third Trump administration nominee to withdraw before a confirmation hearing, following former US Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Chad Chronister for the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to the Associated Press.","David weldon, 71, is an internal medicine physician best known for serving as a congressional representative for a central florida district from 1995 to 2009.

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah wynn-williams served as director of public policy under sheryl sandberg for six years at facebook.

Colin Cowherd draws surprising comparison between one superstar NFL quarterback and Donald Trump in bizarre analogy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/colin-cowherd-draws-surprising-comparison-between-one-superstar-nfl-quarterback-and-donald-trump-in-bizarre-analogy/articleshow/118987797.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Colin Cowherd says Aaron Rodgers reminds him of Donald Trump — here’s why



NFL free agency is in full swing, with teams across the league reshaping their rosters, particularly at the quarterback position. Major moves have already been made — Sam Darnold has joined the Seattle Seahawks, Justin Fields has landed with the New York Jets , and Geno Smith has been traded to the Las Vegas Raiders. However, one notable name remains without a new home: Aaron Rodgers . Following his departure from the New York Jets, Rodgers is now a free agent, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his next move.Aaron Rodgers' uncertain future has stirred up intense discussion among sports commentators. On Wednesday's episode of ""The Herd,"" Fox Sports 1 analyst Colin Cowherd made headlines by comparing the four-time NFL MVP to former President Donald Trump — a comparison bound to create waves.“I think Aaron is a little like Trump, they give off the same energy that they receive,” Cowherd remarked to co-host Jason McIntyre. “I’ve known people who I wouldn’t think would get along with Trump, who have gotten along with Trump. If you give Trump a certain energy, you can get along. I think Aaron gives you the energy that you give him, and that’s his personality.”Cowherd’s comparison stems from Rodgers’ perceived polarizing nature, which has mirrored Trump’s divisive public persona. Both figures have cultivated loyal followings while simultaneously alienating others. Rodgers' outspoken stance on controversial issues, including his friendship with anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has added to this perception. Interestingly, RFK Jr. had reportedly considered Rodgers as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election — a proposal Rodgers turned down to remain focused on football.Rodgers’ time with the Jets unraveled during the 2024 season after he failed to return to peak form following his Achilles injury in 2023. The Jets' struggles on the field, combined with Rodgers’ perceived lack of accountability, seemingly convinced the organization that it was time for a fresh start. The team has since appointed a new general manager, a new head coach, and a new starting quarterback, signaling a clear desire to move forward without Rodgers.At 41 years old, Rodgers’ playing window is closing fast. His personality and history of turbulent exits — first from Green Bay and now from New York — have made potential suitors cautious. While Rodgers’ talent is undeniable, his strong personality and the potential for off-field drama could deter teams from taking a chance on him.Also Read: Texas judge grants protective order to woman who accused Chiefs’ WR Xavier Worthy of assault A decision on Rodgers’ future will likely need to be made soon, both by the quarterback himself and any interested teams.
