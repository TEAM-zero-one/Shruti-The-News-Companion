What is The Resistance Front (TRF)?



The United States on Thursday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), an offshoot of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).The TRF -- the group responsible for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people.The US department of state, led by secretary Marco Rubio , said in a statement that TRF is a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy and front, and that it had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack.The statement said the group has also carried out multiple assaults on Indian security forces, including as recently as 2024.""Today, the Department of State is adding The Resistance Front (TRF) as a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). TRF, a Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) front and proxy, claimed responsibility for the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack which killed 26 civilians. This was the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks conducted by LeT. TRF has also claimed responsibility for several attacks against Indian security forces, including most recently in 2024,"" the statement read.The statement added that the action reflects the Trump administration’s commitment to protecting national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing US President Donald Trump's call for justice for the Pahalgam attack.TRF and its aliases have been added under LeT’s designation as an FTO and SDGT, under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224, respectively. The department of state also reaffirmed the FTO status of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.The Resistance Front was formed in 2019 as a proxy of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and was banned by the central government in 2023.It has been actively involved in recruiting youth online, facilitating the infiltration of terrorists, and smuggling weapons and narcotics from Pakistan into Jammu and Kashmir.TRF had also claimed responsibility for several attacks targeting civilians, political leaders, and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Its founder and commander, Sheikh Sajjad Gul, has been designated a terrorist under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.According to security agencies, TRF’s operations are backed by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which uses the group as part of its strategy to keep the Kashmir region unstable.The April 22 attack, carried out in the Baisaran Valley, a popular tourist destination often called ""mini Switzerland"" -- is being described as the worst terror strike on civilians in Kashmir since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.","The resistance front (trf) is an offshoot of the banned lashkar-e-tayyiba.

My rate vs your rate: Govt vs central banks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-rate-vs-your-rate-govt-vs-central-banks/articleshow/122707532.cms,"Trump on powell

Trump dissing Fed chief Powell is new only to the extent that the former is rude. Plenty of govt bosses, in the West or in India, have had a go at chiefs of central banks. Govts like cheap money, it’s feel-good.

Central banks hate inflation. There lies the tension

‘CRAZY’, ‘LOCO’

INTERESTED PARTIES

NIXON WAS WORSE

INDEPENDENCE DAYS

Ex-US President Nixon

TUSSLE CONTINUES

Ex-RBI governors

Jerome Powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with Trump. He called Powell “Too Late” for dithering in the face of the 2022 inflation surge. Also, “low IQ”, “very stupid”, “average mentally person”, and declared, “I think he’s doing a terrible job.” Yet, Trump is at a loss: “I do it every way in the book. I’m nasty. I’m nice. Nothing works.”Now, Trump’s aides are trying a pincer over the alleged $700mn cost overrun in the Fed building’s renovation that might let them pin Powell to the mat in his last year as Fed chair. Or not. Powell, after all, has been here before.When Trump picked Powell over Janet Yellen late in 2017, he was, in the President’s words: “strong, committed, smart”, someone who would provide the Fed “the leadership it needs in the years to come”.But six months into his first term, he was already out of favour.A non-economist — Powell’s a lawyer by training — he was expected to toe Trump’s line on interest rates. Basically, keep interest rates low to spur growth, boost stock prices, and ensure Trump’s re-election in 2020. Powell turned out to have a spine, and by Aug 2018 Trump was calling the Fed “crazy”, “loco”, “gone wild”. He told The Wall Street Journal: “(Powell) was supposed to be a low-interestrate guy. It’s turned out that he’s not. ”The crux of the Trump-Powell feud is the cost of money, or interest rates. Govts universally want money to be cheap, so that businesses don’t hesitate to borrow for expansion. Expanding businesses add jobs, GDP grows, stock markets zoom, and everybody lives happily ever after.However, cheap money can also drive up prices, or inflation, and when things cost more, people buy less, so businesses put off expansion. And if demand falls too much, jobs are lost, and everybody is miserable.So, central banks universally aim to keep price rise in check with interest rates. But because interest rates, unlike Schrodinger’s cat, can’t be in two states — high and low, in this case — at the same time, govts and central bankers with a spine must agree to disagree.History repeats itself. In 1969, Nixon picked Arthur Burns to head the Fed. Like Trump, he believed Burns would prove pliant, and just to be sure he told him: “I know there’s the myth of the autonomous Fed…” To ensure everyone else also got this, he declared at Burns’s swearing-in: “I respect his independence. However, I hope that, independently, he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.”Nixon wanted low rates with an eye on the 1972 election, and we know from the “Nixon tapes” that he told Burns in Oct 1971: “Liquidity problem (too much money in the system)... is just bullshit”. Burns obliged. His rate cut stimulated the economy in the short term and handed Nixon a landslide victory, but then caused an inflation problem that lasted a decade, and became the strongest argument for central bank independence (CBI).Central banks like RBI and the US Fed are a relatively recent development. Before WW-2, they were merely the lenders of last resort. After the war, setting interest rates became their job, but with plenty of govt interference. In India, RBI governor Benegal Rama Rau quit in 1957 after a face-off with finance minister T T Krishnamachari. During the Vietnam war, President Johnson summoned the Fed chair to his ranch and criticised the prevailing monetary policy.Even Milton Friedman, who coined the term ‘central bank independence’ in 1962, wasn’t in favour of all-powerful central banks. He wanted govt to set central bank objectives, and banks to attain them using policy instruments like interest rates — without further interference. CBI was important for central banks to function without fear of criticism from a man like Trump, especially since there’s a lag between policy implementation and results.Over a century from 1923, CBI has risen around the world. Trinity College professor Davide Romelli’s analysis shows 370 banking reforms across 155 countries — 279 of these increased CBI and 91 reduced it. Globally, the CBI index rose from 0.35 in the 1970s to 0.6 by 2020.That’s why Trump, when he brought “independent” govt agencies under his thumb with an executive order, made it clear that “This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.”Still, the old tussle for control over monetary policy continues. The Chidambaram-Subbarao standoff over interest rates in 2012, RBI governor Urjit Patel’s resignation in 2018, resignations of two Argentine central bank chiefs — Martin Redrado in 2010 and Juan Carlos Fabrega in 2014 (Luis Caputo’s 2018 resignation was under IMF pressure) — and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s choice of a “like-minded” central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, in 2013, are all examples of govt’s upper hand.But govt assertiveness over central banks takes a toll on stocks and bonds. For example, the S&P 500 dipped 2.4% when Trump called Powell a “major loser” in April. That’s why he can’t use a hammer to dislodge the Fed chief. What he can do is try to pry Powell off with a screwdriver, and that’s what he’s doing.","Jerome powell may still be a marked man. Trump now says he won’t sack him. But you never know with trump.

NEW DELHI: The US Department of State on Friday designated The Resistance Front (TRF), which claimed responsibility for the April 22 Pahalgam massacre, a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).Highlighting the TRF's involvement in multiple attacks against India, including the deadly Pahalgam attack, the state department said the decision reflected the Trump administration’s ""commitment to protecting US national security, countering terrorism, and enforcing President Trump’s call for justice following the Pahalgam attack"".""TRF and other associated aliases have been added to LeT’s designation as a FTO and SDGT pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Executive Order 13224, respectively.

Amendments to FTO designations go into effect upon publication in the Federal Register,"" the statement read.The April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy hatched by Pakistan spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) on the directions of the country’s political and military brass, and executed exclusively by Pakistani terrorists.In what sources have described an LeT-ISI joint project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) gave specific directions to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings in Pahalgam’s Baisaran valley.To ensure complete secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorists were taken on board, and instead, LeT foreign terrorists operating in J&K for sometime were told to execute the killings while ensuring minimal local involvement on a “need-to-know” basis.The Pahalgam attack squad was led by Sulaiman, a suspected former Pakistani special forces commando, who had trained at the LeT Muridke hub in Pakistan’s Punjab province before crossing the LoC in 2022 with his M-4 weapon to enter the Jammu region. Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident. Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission.Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley. Only one local terror recruitment has been reported so far this year.","The us department of state on friday designated the resistance front (trf) as a foreign terrorist organisation (fto) and a specially designated global terrorist (sdgt) the april 22 terrorist attack in pahalgam's baisaran meadow, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122683606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-449979,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Time For Revival...': Russia's Big Unity Call To Rivals India & China | 'RIC Troika Will...'

(With inputs from agencies)

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: China on Thursday expressed its support for Russia’s initiative to revive the dormant Russia-India-China (RIC) troika.Russian news portal Izvestia on Thursday quoted Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying that Moscow expects the resumption of the RIC format and is negotiating on this issue with Beijing and New Delhi.“This topic appears in our negotiations with both of them. We are interested in making this format work, because these three countries are important partners, besides being the founders of BRICS,” Rudenko said.“Therefore, the absence of this format, in my opinion, looks inappropriate. In this regard, we expect that the countries will agree to resume work within the framework of the RIC — of course, when relations between these states reach a level that allows them to work in a trilateral format,” he said.In India, the ministry of external affairs said RIC is a consultative format where the three countries discuss global issues and regional issues of interest to them. “As to when this particular RIC format meeting is going to be held, it is something that will be worked out among the three countries in a mutually convenient manner,” said the spokesperson.Asked for his reaction to Rudenko’s comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Thursday said, “China-Russia-India cooperation not only serves the respective interests of the three countries but also helps uphold peace, security, stability and progress in the region and the world.”China stands ready to maintain communication with Russia and India on advancing the trilateral cooperation, he said.The Russian and Chinese interests in the revival of RIC followed the recent visit of foreign minister S Jaishankar to China to take part in the SCO foreign ministers meeting, during which he held talks with his Chinese and Russian counterpaerts Wang Yi and Sergei Lavrov.Joint work in the RIC format was stalled, first because of the Covid pandemic and then by the India-China military standoff at eastern Ladakh in 2020.",China expresses its support for russia’s initiative to revive the dormant russia-india-china troika.

I am not worried at all. If something happens, we will deal with it. There is sufficient supply available,” Puri said at an industry event.Separately, the foreign ministry said govt’s overriding priority was to secure the energy needs of its people, while also cautioning against any double standards on the issue.The comments, in response to media queries, followed NATO chief Mark Rutte’s threat, echoing the US, that countries like India, China and Brazil would take a battering for buying Russian exports.“Let me reiterate, and I have said this in the past as well.

India has in the past too accused the West of having double standards on the issue, saying that European countries have themselves benefited from importing Russian energy for prolonged periods.Puri said India has built up “navigational resilience” by expanding the sourcing of oil from 40 countries against 27 countries earlier. “India has been clear that it will buy oil from wherever it has to. The prime minister’s commitment, in the final analysis, is to the Indian consumer,” he said.In addition, Puri said, more oil was coming into the global market from countries such as Brazil, Guyana and Canada that are not members of the OPEC+ grouping. “If a major source goes off the market, you diversify. The current debate in the oil market is whether prices will be in the range of $65-70 or $60-65 (per barrel),” he said.","Petroleum minister hardeep singh puri said india can arrange alternative supplies if russian oil exports are sanctioned.

NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav took a dig at Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan on Thursday for hosting a ‘mutton party’ in Lakhisarai — part of his Munger Lok Sabha constituency.""BJP would now say that it is 'punya' that Lalan Singh is feeding mutton to his people & workers, because he is their ally & a Union minister. They won't say anything now. When PM comes here tomorrow, I hope he will speak on Lalan Singh, that he is feeding mutton in Sawan,"" Tejashwi told PTI Video, in a sarcastic response to PM's earlier criticism of Tejaswi over a similar issue.There is a history of such controversies in Bihar politics. Last year, Tejashwi faced backlash — including from PM Modi — after a video showed him eating fish fry during Navratri. Interestingly, the video in question was posted by Tejashwi himself, who later clarified it was shot before the festival and meant to expose what he called the “low IQ” of his critics.Two years ago, BJP leaders including had slammed a mutton feast hosted by RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav during Saawan, which was attended by Rahul Gandhi. Prime Minister Modi , addressing an election rally in Jammu and Kashmir's Udhampur, had said, ""They visit a criminal's house, a convict out on bail in Sawan to cook mutton. They make videos to mock people, echoing the Mughal era mentality. They aim to provoke citizens and secure their vote bank, now they'll rain bullets on me, abuse me.

India tests new weapons system for China border,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-new-weapons-system-for-china-border/articleshow/122676664.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: The Army will soon begin inducting two regiments of the Akash Prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China, with the force testing the new weapon system in Ladakh twice on Wednesday.The Akash Prime missiles successfully destroyed two high-speed unmanned aerial targets at an altitude of around 15,000-feet during the trials, which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as “a significant milestone and boost” for India’s air defence capabilities, especially for high-altitude operational requirements.The existing Akash air defence systems with the Army and IAF were extensively used against drones, loitering munitions and the like launched by Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor Both Akash and Akash Prime have the capability to intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters and drones at a 25-km range, but the latter is the upgraded customised version for high-altitude areas above 4,500-metre with modified ground systems and radars as well as new radio frequency seekers in the missiles.“Various upgrades have been made in the Akash Prime system, designed by DRDO and produced by defence PSU Bharat Dynamics, based on operational feedback from the Army to improve its operational effectiveness.Wednesday’s trials were conducted as part of the first production model firing to enable timely induction,” an official said.Under a Rs 8,160 crore contract in March 2023, the Army Air Defence (AAD) is now raising the two new regiments for the Akash Prime system, which also have a reduced footprint with 360° engagement capability, to add to its two existing Akash regiments. The IAF, in turn, already has 15 Akash squadrons ordered for Rs 10,900 crore, with more being in the pipeline, as reported by TOI earlier.The DRDO has also developed the Akash-NG (new generation) weapon system, with an initial interception range of 30-km that will be progressively enhanced. Tested for the first time in Jan 2021, the Akash-NG consists of more compact missiles with advanced radio frequency seekers, launchers, multi-function radars, and command, control and communication systems.“The Akash-NG is a canister-based system for much greater operational flexibility. Each canister can carry six missiles. Once inducted, it will be a major force-multiplier to ensure that the kill or hit probability goes up further,” another official said.The MoD said the improved Akash system “marks a major step forward for India’s missile development programmes, which are now gaining increasing attention in the global defence market”.While Armenia was the first foreign customer for the Akash systems, India also offered them to the UAE when Dubai crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum visited India in April.The AAD, incidentally, is also slated to get three regiments of the new indigenous quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems for Rs 36,000 crore. These highly-mobile QRSAMs, with interception ranges of up to 30 km, and the Akash systems will add to India’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.","The army will soon begin inducting two regiments of the akash prime surface-to-air missiles designed for air defence in high-altitude areas along the frontier with china.

NEW DELHI: The US embassy in India has warned that “committing assault, theft, or burglary in the United States won’t just cause you legal issues — it could lead to your visa being revoked and make you ineligible for future US visas”. The warning was issued days after a video of an Indian woman who tried to leave a store with a cart full of items without paying went viral. This also prompted the embassy to say, “The US values law and order and expects foreign visitors to follow all US laws.”Responding to queries on the issue, the ministry of external affairs said that “whether a person is living in any country—whether they are a citizen of that country or a foreign national—it is their responsibility to abide by the laws there”. “I would say that whenever our people go abroad, we always urge them to respect and follow the laws of that country, so that they can build a good and positive image for themselves, and through them, also project a good image of our country,” ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.The Indian woman had spent several hours in the store of a famous chain on May 1. She allegedly picked up items worth $1,300 and then tried to leave the store without paying.Her video of a staff confronting her when caught had gone viral.“Are you allowed to steal things in India? I did not think so,” a woman police officer who is buzzing the woman is heard saying. According to the video, she’s facing felony charges, and although she hasn’t been arrested yet, charges are anticipated.","The warning was issued days after a video of an indian woman who tried to leave a store with a cart full of items without paying went viral.

NHL trade news: Bowen Byram’s Buffalo deal fuels more drama despite contract extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-news-bowen-byrams-buffalo-deal-fuels-more-drama-despite-contract-extension/articleshow/122665859.cms,"Bowen Byram stuns NHL fans by inking new deal with Buffalo Sabres (Credit: Getty Images)

Trade rumors return as teams circle

Sabres risk déjà vu at the next deadline



A restless fanbase watches and waits

Just days ago, the Buffalo Sabres avoided arbitration with defenseman Bowen Byram, agreeing to a two-year, $12.5 million deal. The situation had finally calmed. However, it has only added fuel to the fire regarding Byram’s long-term future with the franchise.Despite the promising potential, Byram’s stint in Buffalo has been filled with uncertainty. Earlier in the season, speculation rose that he was unhappy with his role on the third defensive pairing. Although he never officially requested a trade, rumblings were loud enough for General Manager Kevyn Adams to take notice.The short-term nature of Byram’s contract raises eyebrows. While it avoids the messy process of arbitration, it also walks him directly into unrestricted free agency in 2027–28. It’s a strategic move that allows both the player and team flexibility, but that flexibility has sparked renewed trade speculation.The Sabres’ front office is now walking a fine line. They can’t afford to let another high-profile asset leave without return, especially if Byram shows signs of being unsettled again. While the player is technically locked in, his long-term future in Buffalo is anything but guaranteed.This is not the first time the Buffalo Sabres have been caught in an “extend-and-hope” scenario. If Byram remains through the end of the 2025–26 season, he becomes eligible to sign an extension on July 1, 2026. If talks stall or his performance spikes, trade discussions will intensify, likely reaching a boiling point by the 2026 NHL Trade Deadline.While some fans are relieved that arbitration was avoided, many remain skeptical that this extension will bring true stability. With Byram’s contract offering Buffalo no long-term security, and a history of tension behind the scenes, there’s a growing sense this saga is far from over.As the NHL offseason progresses, all eyes will remain on Bowen Byram and the Buffalo Sabres because when the season starts, the trade talk could explode again.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Flames’ Rasmus Andersson linked to potential trade for Stars’ $31 million winger in wild proposal","Buffalo sabres avoided arbitration with defenseman bowen byram, agreeing to a two-year, $12.5 million deal.

Rishi Sunak: A journey from banker to Prime Minister to a job at Goldman Sachs — a return no one expected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-a-journey-from-banker-to-prime-minister-to-a-job-at-goldman-sachs-a-return-no-one-expected/articleshow/122344536.cms,"Image: Getty Images

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Now, as he re-enters the private sector, many will watch to see how Sunak’s unique blend of political insight and financial expertise influences Goldman Sachs’ global strategy. His move also raises broader questions about the crossover between public leadership and corporate influence in a post-pandemic world.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.When Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former uk prime minister rishi sunak is returning to goldman sachs as a senior adviser.

Who was Felix Baumgartner?



Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner, immortalised for his breathtaking 2012 skydive from the stratosphere, tragically died Thursday in a paragliding crash in Porto Sant’Elpidio, Italy. He was 56.Baumgartner, famously known as “Fearless Felix,” made history on October 14, 2012, when he became the first human to break the sound barrier in freefall - without the aid of a machine. The jump, conducted as part of the Red Bull Stratos mission, captured the world’s attention and remains one of the most iconic feats in extreme sports.In the now-legendary video, streamed live to millions, Baumgartner stands on the edge of a tiny capsule 24 miles (39 kilometers) above Earth, looks down at the curve of the planet, flashes a calm thumbs-up, and leaps. What follows is four minutes of pure human daring - as he plummets at speeds reaching 843.6 mph (1,357.6 km/h), eventually deploying his parachute and landing safely in the New Mexico desert.“Sometimes you have to go really high to understand how small you are,” Baumgartner said moments before the jump, words that still echo across time.From his teenage skydives to BASE jumps off skyscrapers and canyons, to flying across the English Channel in carbon wings, Baumgartner lived a life above ground - and far beyond the ordinary.But it was his 2012 leap that cemented his place in history.More than a decade later, that jump still inspires awe. Watch the moment below and remember the man who dared to fall faster than sound - and made the world hold its breath.Felix Baumgartner was an Austrian skydiver, BASE jumper, stunt pilot, and extreme sports icon known for pushing the limits of human flight. Born in Salzburg in 1969, he began skydiving in his teens and honed his skills in the Austrian military. Over the years, he became famous for daring stunts - from jumping off skyscrapers to gliding across the English Channel in carbon wings. In 1999, he gained international attention by performing the world’s lowest BASE jump from the hand of Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue.However, it was his 2012 Red Bull Stratos mission that truly defined him: a 24-mile skydive from the stratosphere, making him the first person to break the sound barrier without mechanical assistance. Known as “Fearless Felix,” he combined precision, planning, and bravery in everything he did. Baumgartner was also a licensed helicopter pilot and balloonist, embodying a lifelong passion to be, quite literally, above it all.","Felix baumgartner, 56, died in a paragliding crash in porto sant’elpidio, italy.
