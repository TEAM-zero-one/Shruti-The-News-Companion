waqf bill

accepted, set to vote in support

NEW DELHI: Defying resistance from opposition parties and Muslim bodies like All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), the govt has decided to seek passage of Waqf (Amendment) Bill in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, clearing the way for a showdown in the House.With the numbers arrayed on its side thanks to support from 'secular' allies TDP, JD(U) and LJP, the govt has also decided to push for the bill to be passed by Rajya Sabha on Thursday.The INDIA bloc met on Tuesday evening and decided to participate in the debate and oppose it with gusto, with the leadership agreeing against any disruption or boycott when the legislation is taken up.Sources said there was complete unanimity that opposition should put forth its viewpoint on Waqf (Amendment) Bill forcefully. They will seek voting on the bill.Govt's urgency and determination, significant in view of the 'black armband' protest by Muslim organisations in different parts during Eid prayers, was evident at the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting Tuesday with govt not agreeing to opposition's demand for a 12-hour discussion in LS, something which would have raised doubts about passage of the bill in Parliament by Friday when the Budget session concludes. Lok Sabha will now have an eight-hour debate which, by all accounts, is going to be a stormy affair.A teaser of what could unfold was on display at BAC meeting when opposition, unhappy with Speaker Om Birla's assurance that he was open to extending the debate depending on the views of the House, walked out.Majority of the parties, including BJP, Congress and their respective allies, have issued whips to their MPs to attend the House for the next couple of days, beginning with Wednesday noon when minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju is scheduled to introduce the bill, redrafted in accordance with the suggestions made by a joint parliamentary committee.However, the political heat and length of the debate are unlikely to have any bearing on the final outcome as the numbers heavily favour NDA. The strength of the alliance in LS is 293, comfortably ahead of the majority mark in the 542-member House.Even in Rajya Sabha, NDA has surpassed the majority mark with 126 members on its side in the House of 236 members, including two independents and six nominated members, who invariably vote in support of the govt. A few abstentions are not ruled out, sources said.Meanwhile, opposition bloc dubbed the bill ""unconstitutional, anti-minority and anti-Muslim"". It said the bill was brought with the idea of harassing one religious community. Led by Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, it was decided that opposition should rebuff the possibility of disruption, and should not boycott or walk out. ""The House should run smoothly and all should speak on the bill,"" sources quoted Kharge as saying at INDIA bloc meeting.Arvind Sawant of Sena UBT said, ""Opposition is united. This bill is divisionary. We will take part in the discussion and see if govt has incorporated our suggestions and amendments in the bill.""BJP allies TDP, JDU and LJP, which had initially expressed reservations over some aspects of the bill, came around claiming that their suggestions, based on feedback from their Muslim constituents, were incorporated in the new bill.","Tdp, jdu & ljp say their suggestions on waqf (amendment) bill have been accepted.

Speaking on the occasion, Misri said such celebrations would become even more meaningful if “promising beginnings” in the relationship are translated into tangible benefits for the people of India and China.The foreign secretary said that the road ahead – of rebuilding ties based on mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interests – was not going to be an easy one but India was prepared to walk on it. “We are looking at the next steps to resume practical cooperation between our two countries, and amongst the first of these steps is the resumption of the Kailash Mansarovar yatra this year,’’ he said.According to a Chinese readout, Modi told Li in his message that progress in bilateral relations will contribute not only to global stability and prosperity but also to the emergence of a multipolar world.In his message to Murmu, Xi said both India and China are important members of the Global South and at a critical stage in their efforts to modernise, reiterating China’s position that an elephant-dragon tango will completely serve the fundamental interests of both countries. According to a Chinese readout, the 75th anniversary of ties was an opportunity to promote “strategic mutual trust…jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in China-India border regions, advance China-India relations on the track of sound and stable development”.Ties between the 2 countries have improved considerably since the agreement in October 2024 to complete the troop disengagement process in eastern Ladakh and the first Modi-Xi bilateral in 5 years in Russia’s Kazan that took place on October 23. Russian ambassador Denis Alipov was present at the event hosted by the Chinese embassy.Modi said recently in a podcast that normalcy had returned in the border areas since his meeting with Xi and he expected trust to return too in the relationship slowly but surely.Misri said that India and China had resolved several issues along the border areas, adding peace and tranquillity in the border areas is critical for the smooth development of overall bilateral relations.“And it is on the basis of this fundamental understanding, which was shared in the meeting between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping in Kazan, that both of us are now working together to chart a road map for our bilateral relations to return to a stable, predictable, and amicable path,’’ said Misri. In an interview with Global Times on Tuesday, the Chinese ambassador said that China was ready to import more goods from India to strengthen trade but also expected India to create a fair and transparent business climate for Chinese companies.","The nascent warmth in sino-indian ties was on full display again tuesday.

Just incredible to look at night as well as during the day, highlighted, of course, by the Himalayas, which is just incredible as a forefront going down into India.”“Every time we went over the Himalayas, and I'll tell you, Butch got some incredible pictures of the Himalayas. Just amazing,” Williams said.William's praise for India brought back the memories of Sqn Ldr Rakesh Sharma, who had told the then Indian PM Indira Gandhi from space in 1984 that the country from space looks like “Sare jahan se achcha”.The view of India from space felt like a personal connection to Williams’s heritage. “I have described it before like this ripple that happened when the plates collided, and then, as it flows down into India, it is many-many colours,” she explained.Expressing happiness at Indian astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla going to the ISS under Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), Williams said, “I'm gonna be going back to my father's home country and visiting with people and getting excited about the first, or not the first, but the Indian national who's going up on the Axiom Mission coming up, pretty awesome.” Williams's father Deepak Pandya hailed from Gujarat and came to the US in 1958 where he did his internship and residency training in Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio. She was born in Ohio to Deepak and Ursuline Bonnie Pandya.On Shukla, she said, “They'll have a hometown hero there of their own who will be able to talk about how wonderful the International Space Station is from his perspective. But I hope I can meet up at some point in time. We can share our experiences with as many people in India as possible because it's a great country, another wonderful democracy that's trying to put its foot in space... We'd love to be part of that and help them along.”Lucknow-born Shukla will be India's second astronaut to go to space after former IAF officer Rakesh Sharma, who flew aboard Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984 as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme.It is likely that she will meet PM Modi when she visits India in the near future. PM Modi had welcomed Williams and her fellow Crew-9 members when they returned to Earth after the prolonged mission to the ISS, saying their unwavering determination will forever inspire millions. “Welcome back, Crew9! The Earth missed you,” Modi had then posted on X.Williams joked about taking space crew members on a trip to India. “You might stick out a little bit. That is okay. We will get you all primed with some spicy food,” she said with a laugh.When asked if he would fly again aboard the Starliner that faced a technical issue in space and had to return to Earth without them, Wilmore said, “Yes, because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work. Boeing is completely committed. Nasa is completely committed, and with that, I'd get on in a heartbeat.""",Indian-origin nasa astronaut sunita williams on returning to earth after her 286-day-long stay at the international space station.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday strongly condemned the statement made by Bangladesh government's chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus, claiming that Bangladesh is the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean for the region, as the seven northeastern Indian states are ""landlocked."" Sarma called Yunus' comments ""offensive"".""The statement made by Md Younis of Bangladesh's so called interim government referring to the seven sister states of Northeast India as landlocked and positioning Bangladesh as their guardian of ocean access, is offensive and strongly condemnable,"" Sarma said in a post on X.Chief advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, during his four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to expand its presence in the region. He highlighted that India's seven northeastern states are landlocked and suggested that Bangladesh could serve as a key gateway to the ocean for the region.In a widely shared video on social media, Yunus encouraged China to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, saying that Dhaka holds strategic access to the sea. He said, ""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.""Yunus further said, ""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world.""Responding to Yunus's statement, Assam CM said, ""This remark underscores the persistent vulnerability narrative associated with India’s strategic “Chicken’s Neck” corridor. Historically, even internal elements within India have dangerously suggested severing this critical passageway to isolate the Northeast from the mainland physically.""Sarma also called for building alternative road routes to Northeast India. ""Therefore, it is imperative to develop more robust railway and road networks both underneath and around the Chicken’s Neck corridor . Additionally, exploring alternative road routes connecting the Northeast to mainland India, effectively bypassing the Chicken’s Neck, should be prioritized. Though this may pose significant engineering challenges, it is achievable with determination and innovation,"" he said.Earlier, on Monday, the Congress party called Yunus's statement ""very dangerous"" for the security of the Northeast region and alleged that the government is not taking care of the region including Manipur. ""Bangladesh is inviting China to encircle India. This attitude of the Bangladesh government is very dangerous for the security of our North East region. The government is not taking care of Manipur and China has already settled villages in Arunachal,"" Congress's head of media and publicity department Pawan Khera said in a post in Hindi on X.""Our foreign policy is in such a pathetic state that the country, in whose creation India had a major role, is also today engaged in rallying against us,"" Khera added.Khera's Congress colleague, Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi, also criticized the government for its foreign policy.""It is unfortunate that India’s foreign policy has weakened to the point where even a nation whose independence India actively supported is now leaning toward strategic opposition.

'Not joking': Why Donald Trump is repeatedly talking about a third term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-joking-why-donald-trump-is-repeatedly-talking-about-a-third-term/articleshow/119872811.cms,"Why it matters

This isn’t just about ego or political theatre. Trump’s repeated third-term teases fit a pattern seen in countries where leaders dismantle democratic norms to hold on to power. From Russia to China to Turkey, term limits have become mere suggestions — and Trump, who’s already bent many American norms, appears intrigued by that model.

He’s long admired authoritarian leaders , from Vladimir Putin to China’s Xi Jinping to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman . All have one thing in common: they’ve either abolished term limits or rule with no real political competition.

, from to China’s to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince . All have one thing in common: they’ve either abolished term limits or rule with no real political competition. As Trump himself once said of Xi, “He’s now president for life... maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.”

The big picture

Trump’s fascination with authoritarian strongmen isn’t new. But in the context of a second term where he’s already consolidating power, weakening institutional resistance, and facing no internal GOP challenge, his third-term talk hits differently.

Putin sidestepped term limits by becoming prime minister before returning to the presidency and later rewrote the rules entirely.

Xi amended China’s constitution in 2018 to remove the two-term limit, clearing the way to rule indefinitely.

Erdogan in Turkey used constitutional changes and a new presidential system to entrench power.

Orbán in Hungary has manipulated courts and elections to turn a democracy into a one-party state in all but name.

Trump isn’t hiding his admiration. He calls them “tough” and “smart” and frequently contrasts their power with what he claims are the shackles of American democracy.

What they’re saying

“There are methods by which you could do it, as you know,” Trump told NBC. He did not elaborate. “I’m not joking.”

“Don’t underestimate Donald Trump’s willingness not only to socialize the unthinkable in American politics but actually to act on it,” said Susan Glasser, New Yorker journalist and author on Putin.

“It reads like somebody who doesn’t want to be treated like a lame duck,” said Derek Muller, Notre Dame law professor.

Even some Republicans are publicly brushing off the idea. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Trump was “probably having some fun with it.” Others, like Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN), are taking steps — proposing a constitutional amendment to allow non-consecutive three-term presidencies, tailored specifically to Trump.

Look, you guys continue to ask the president this question about a third term, and then he answers honestly and candidly with a smile, and then everybody here melts down about his answer. “It’s not really something we’re thinking about. He has four years. There’s a lot of work to do. We’ve done a lot, nearly for 100 days. And the American people love what this president is doing. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary

Floating the impossible, freezing the field

The authoritarian playbook

The impulse to cling to power is not unique to Trump. What’s more concerning is how familiar his behavior has become, a CNN report said.

Susan Glasser, a New Yorker writer and Putin biographer, called it “socializing the unthinkable”—pushing past norms until the impossible starts to feel plausible. This is how authoritarianism creeps in: not with coups, but with drift.

Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, once seen as a European reformer, turned his democracy into a one-party state through a mix of legal manipulation, court-packing, and media intimidation. Trump has praised Orbán too.

The American system has guardrails. But guardrails don’t matter if they’re not enforced—and Trump has spent much of his time in office weakening those very institutions that could stop him. He’s attacked the judiciary, threatened universities, punished law firms that oppose him, and floated executive orders to federalize election oversight.

The destruction of the civil service is already under way, pressure on the press and universities has begun, and thoughts of changing the Constitution are in the air... America is spinning quickly in the direction of Hungarian populism, Hungarian politics, and Hungarian justice. But that means Hungarian stagnation, Hungarian corruption, and Hungarian poverty lie in our future too. Anne Applebaum in Atlantic in an article titled 'America’s Future Is Hungary'

The legal reality

The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment is unambiguous: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

As per a WSJ report, Trump’s allies have floated workarounds: running as VP and then taking over, serving as Speaker and ascending through resignations — but constitutional scholars say none of those hold up.

The 12th Amendment blocks anyone ineligible for the presidency from being vice president.

A constitutional amendment to allow a third term would require two-thirds support in Congress and ratification by 38 states — mathematically out of reach in today’s polarized climate.

Still, Trump doesn’t have to succeed legally to win politically. As he’s shown repeatedly, the spectacle is often the point.

What’s next

US President Donald Trump has openly mused about serving a third term, brushing off the 22nd Amendment’s clear prohibition and declaring recently, “I’m not joking.” In an NBC interview, he even hinted at unspecified “methods” that could allow him to stay in power beyond 2029.While Trump has often used provocations to troll critics or dominate headlines, this time feels different. He sounds serious — and that has legal scholars, political strategists, and democracy advocates paying attention.It’s a pattern Trump has refined over years in public life. Say the outrageous. Let the media chase it. Watch his rivals squirm. The more he repeats the idea of a third term, the more it does exactly what he wants: it keeps Republican challengers at bay, distracts from scandals, and re-centers himself in the political universe.“It reads like somebody who doesn’t want to be treated like a lame duck,” Derek Muller, a constitutional law professor at Notre Dame, told the NYT. And he’s right. For Trump, “lame duck” is a fate worse than losing. It means losing the spotlight, the leverage, the illusion of inevitability.By teasing the idea of sticking around past 2029, Trump discourages potential successors from gaining momentum. Noem, DeSantis, Vance—why take the risk of running a national campaign when Trump might simply decide he’s not done?As per a NYT report, this strategy was laid bare when Trump’s musings coincided with a news cycle dominated by an embarrassing leak: top Trump advisers had accidentally included a journalist in a private Signal chat discussing a military operation. The media was primed to dig into the implications. Instead, the oxygen shifted to a new circus: What if Trump runs again?What seemed laughable in 2016 is now a live national conversation. If Trump can convince millions of Americans that the Constitution is flexible, that the presidency is his birthright, and that elections are optional — then the third term may not need to be legal. It just needs to be normalized.“You won’t have to vote anymore,” Trump once said at a rally. “It will be fixed.” That line — half-laugh, half-threat — may say more about his third-term ambitions than any formal plan ever could.Trump will likely continue teasing a third term, both to rally his base and to maintain his dominance over a distracted political class. His allies, like Steve Bannon, hint they’re “working on” legal avenues — despite the overwhelming constitutional roadblocks.“A man like this comes along once every century,” Bannon told NewsNation. “We’re working on it... a couple of alternatives.”Whether serious or symbolic, the implications are real for American democracy.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump’s repeated third-term teases fit a pattern seen in countries where leaders dismantle democratic norms to hold on to power.

Three U.S. Soldiers Found Dead Along With M88 Hercules Near Belarus; Big International Conspiracy?

Trump Flips On Putin After SURPRISE Criticism; ‘He’ll Live Up To…’ | Big U-Turn Jolts Zelensky

Three of the four US soldiers who went missing in Lithuania last week have been confirmed dead after rescuers retrieved their armored vehicle from a peat bog, the US Army announced. The fourth soldier remains unaccounted for.The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near Pabradė, an area located close to the Belarusian border. Lithuanian authorities were alerted to their disappearance on Tuesday, prompting an intense search operation.Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie , commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, expressed deep sorrow for the fallen soldiers, saying, “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘dogface soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”A six-day recovery mission, involving US, Polish, and Lithuanian military personnel, ultimately led to the discovery of the three soldiers' bodies after their armored vehicle, an M88 Hercules, was found in the bog. The recovery process involved the use of heavy equipment and excavators to remove the thick silt and water surrounding the vehicle before it was pulled out early Monday morning.According to US Army Europe and Africa ’s public affairs office, the soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division.“Three US Army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” the statement read, adding that their identities would be withheld until their families were notified.The recovery operation was extensive, with hundreds of local and foreign personnel involved, including engineers, divers, and rescue workers. The Lithuanian Armed Forces contributed military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and specialized personnel. Heavy construction equipment and technical experts were also mobilised to assist in the effort.US Navy divers played a crucial role, maneuvering through thick layers of mud and sediment with zero visibility to attach steel cables to the 63-tonne vehicle. Despite challenges, including the vehicle losing traction during the extraction, additional bulldozers were brought in to assist. The vehicle was finally freed after two hours of intense work.As the search continues for the fourth soldier, Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor , commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division, thanked all those involved in the operation, describing their efforts as “heroic.” The US Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed on a rotational basis, strengthening the alliance's presence in the region.","The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near pabradė.
