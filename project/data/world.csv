India imposes anti-dumping duties on five Chinese products to protect local industries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-imposes-anti-dumping-duties-on-five-chinese-products-to-protect-local-industries/articleshow/119378432.cms,"India has imposed anti-dumping duties on five products imported from China, including vacuum flasks and aluminium foil, to protect local industries from unfairly low-priced imports. These goods – Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks , aluminium foil, Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid , and Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin – were found to be sold in India at prices below normal market value.According to notifications from the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, the duties will be applicable for five years on imports of Soft Ferrite Cores, vacuum insulated flasks, and Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid. A provisional anti-dumping duty, up to USD 873 per tonne, has been levied on aluminium foil imports for a duration of six months, news agency PTI reported.The government has also imposed duties ranging from USD 276 per tonne to USD 986 per tonne on Trichloro Isocyanuric Acid, a chemical used for water treatment, imported from both China and Japan. For Soft Ferrite Cores, used in devices like electric vehicles, chargers, and telecom equipment, a duty of up to 35% of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) value will be applied.In the case of vacuum insulated flasks, an anti-dumping duty of USD 1,732 per tonne has been imposed, while duties on Poly Vinyl Chloride Paste Resin imports range from USD 89 per tonne to USD 707 per tonne. These duties apply to imports from China, Korea, Malaysia, Norway, Taiwan, and Thailand, and will remain in effect for five years.These measures follow recommendations made by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the investigation arm of the Ministry of Commerce. Anti-dumping duties are imposed by countries to protect domestic industries from a surge in imports at unfairly low prices, in accordance with the rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO).India has previously imposed similar duties on various products to counteract cheap imports from countries like China. As both India and China are WTO members, this action reflects India’s ongoing concerns about the growing trade deficit with its neighbouring country, which reached USD 85 billion in 2023-24.","India has imposed anti-dumping duties on five products imported from china.

"India-EU FTA game changer for German industries, investment into India: German envoy Philip Ackermann",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-eu-fta-game-changer-for-german-industries-investment-into-india-german-envoy-philip-ackermann/articleshow/119388492.cms,"German ambassador Philipp Ackermann

EU’s most powerful state Germany believes the 2025-end deadline for the India-EU FTA , potentially the largest deal of its kind in the world, can be met, leading to an agreement that would be a game changer for many of its industries while also attracting more investments into India. In an interview to TOI, German ambassador Philip Ackermann said the last round of FTA talks, held after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s visit last month during which the deadline was announced, was “quite fruitful and better than the previous rounds”.As Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz looks to preside over a “sea change” in Germany’s security policy, shunning longstanding austerity measures to dramatically boost defence spending amid fears of a US retreat, the ambassador ruled out any dilution of Berlin’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, saying it will continue to be actively involved in the region, including through potential joint military exercises. The conservative leader, who is expected to be elected chancellor next month as a new coalition government takes over, is seeking a stronger European focus on defence and more “independence” from Donald Trump’s America.“Progress on the FTA was one of the substantive outcomes from European Commission president’s visit. The end-of-2025 deadline now seems possible. You have to now reach that goal and I understand the last round of talks after the visit was quite fruitful and was better than the previous rounds. I am cautiously optimistic that we will achieve a good agreement. Germany is hugely interested in this agreement. I think it would be a game changer for many of our industries. It would certainly attract more investment to India. We feel that it would change important parts of our economy,’ said Ackermann.Asked about the Indo-Pacific and India-Germany ties under Merz, the ambassador said Germany has been very clear that Indo-Pacific is an important area for security and trade where India has turned out to be a very good partner. “We think along the same lines, and you can be sure that Germany will continue to be committed to the Indo-Pacific. Like you saw last year with the Tarang Shakti air exercise. Germany will continue to be active along with European, American partners and Indian partners. India with common navy and air force exercises is growing closer to European security and armed forces,’’ said Ackermann, adding there’s a clear continuity now in Germany’s India policy and the 2024 ‘Focus on India’ paper will prevail.Asked about Trump’s indifference to Europe and conflicting signals on NATO, the ambassador said there was a clear signal from Washington that it would like to see European countries spending more on defence but added Europe-America alliance isn’t in any imminent danger. Describing Merz as a Transatlanticist, Ackermann said the new government will make a lot of efforts to keep that alliance meaningful.“Outside Europe, America is our closest ally and we don’t see that changing quickly. At the same time, we have to take into account the discourse in Washington is now different from what it was earlier and we have to adapt to that. Europe has to spend more. You have seen von der Leyen’s Rearm Europe programme that means defence production must increase and small countries should pay more. We feel threatened. Russians have shown they have no scruples, or shame in invading other countries. Why should they stop at Ukraine? It’s important to be better prepared,’’ said the ambassador, talking about what he called a sea change in Germany’s defence policy.While backing all efforts to end the war, he said Russia had basically not accepted the ceasefire proposal and it’s important to understand there can be no peace without Ukraine. “And I think Americans also understand that as they have involved Ukraine in the latest talks in Jeddah,’’ said Ackermann.","Germany believes 2025-end deadline for the india-eu fta can be met.

'India has potential to play global role in nuclear technology market',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-has-potential-to-play-global-role-in-nuclear-technology-market/articleshow/119396395.cms,"International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi

Rafael Mariano Grossi

, director-general of the

International Atomic Energy Agency

(IAEA), was in India recently and met with top policymakers. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Grossi discussed the situations in Iran and Ukraine and praised India’s

nuclear energy initiatives

. Excerpts:

How do you view the nuclear situation in Iran?

The engagement you talked about... Is there a possibility of that taking place with the top powers to find a solution?

You have made a number of visits to Ukraine. How is the situation there now?

How do you see India's move to use nuclear energy in the country's energy transition plan?

And how do you see the recent announcement of allowing the private sector in the small reactor segment?

We still have a lot of work to do. I have said many times that Iran does not have nuclear weapons at the moment, but they are enriching uranium at almost weapon grade level and that they have not provided clear answers on a number of things to IAEA for quite a long time. We are being fair, but at the same time firm in that we do not want to exaggerate anything, but neither do we want to banalise any situation. Iran has a very important, ambitious, technologically developed nuclear programme and they have to provide the answers. We see that there is a movement around the issue. We have witnessed an important meeting in Beijing recently between Russia, China and Iran. We think it's positive. We see that there has been an exchange or at least a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to the Supreme Leader. Even with the polemic around the contents and the replies, etc it means that there is a recognition that there has to be an engagement of some sort. So yes, it is a global concern for the reasons I explained. At the same time, this should be an incentive for all of us to work together to avoid an escalation which, against the backdrop of what is happening in the Middle east, would be tragic.There is a possibility, but this will not be endless or the time will not be limitless. There should be a sense of finality. We want an issuance which is positive, which is diplomatic and non-violent, but at the same time one that provides the international community with assurances. It's in everybody's interest. This is what I say when I talk to my Iranian counterparts.It continues to be fragile. And for as long as combat continues, it will still be the case. Let's never forget the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on the front line. It's very exposed. It has been targeted in the past. There have been many blackouts, situations where the power supply to and from the station was completely interrupted. You remember one of the cooling towers last summer was up in fire. So it is clearly a target. The presence of IAEA there has mitigated the risks, but not eliminated them. We look with expectation, like everybody else, the possibility of a dialogue and negotiation leading to a ceasefire and possibly and hopefully to peace. But until that happens, our concern is that no nuclear accident takes place.I see this very positively. India has top notch technology which it derived initially from western technology. Then you went into your own indigenous development with very good reactors, 20 of them operating flawlessly. But still nuclear is a minute percentage of the national electricity production. And I was happy to see that govt is aiming at going much, much higher - 100 gigawatts, which is possible. I see India as a country that has enormous internal potential, but also, if I may, I see India playing a role globally. Nuclear technology is being exported. And I don't see why India should not be joining the family of vendors who are active in the global market.That for me is a fundamental piece of the puzzle that shows that govt is adjusting its approach and trying to attune to the realities in the world. Nuclear is capital intensive, and not everything can come from public or public utilities. And when you have the needs that you have in India, you have to explore public-private partnerships or even private ownership of plants, including small modular reactors. I see this change in the legal and policy approach from India as a step, a huge step in the right direction.","Rafael mariano grossi was in india recently and met with top policymakers.

The Sisyphus Clause



The Myth of Sisyphus

I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart. The absurd depends as much on man as on the world. Albert Camus

So maybe Pakistan is happier.

Not because it is richer, freer, safer, or better—

But because, like Sisyphus, it has made peace with the mountain.

And it no longer asks why.

Long before he became a meme for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars for a joke that seemed like a punchline for Big Pharma to sell some follicular solutions, Will Smith acted in some remarkable movies. One of the most moving was, a fine film on paternal-filial relationships. In a rather dark moment, he wonders if Thomas Jefferson gaslit America by stating in the Declaration of Independence that every American would be endowed with certain rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He says in the movie: “And I remember thinking: how did he know to put the pursuit part in there? That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it. No matter what.”It’s a sentiment that theappears to agree with—at least for Indians , who have been rankeddespite the fact that it’s a rising global power—one of the few, to borrow a line from the proverbial egg-faced Shashi Tharoor , whose leader can hug both the premiers of Ukraine and Russia.But that’s hardly surprising, because it completely fits into the WENA (Western Europe and Northern American) idea of India. If one were to learn about India solely from Anglosphere coverage, one would assume that India was a genocidal hellhole where the living conditions were worse than sub-Saharan Africa.The fact is that if irony could be measured, the World Happiness Report 2025 would be a more shoddily written Don Quixote. India is ranked 118th—below Saudi Arabia (32), Libya (79), Venezuela (82), Uzbekistan (53), Rwanda (116), China (68), Iran (99), Lebanon (104), Palestine (108), Pakistan (109), Ukraine (111), Iraq (101), Cameroon (104), a list that includes war zones, authoritarian regimes, debt-ridden states, and nations facing civil unrest. Even if one were to accept that there are enough citizens of the world who prefer being a fed sparrow to a hungry songbird, even Pakistanis would be shocked to learn that they are ranked above India and would wonder if the only person surveyed for this poll was Osama Bin Laden So, before we get into the problem with the methodology, let’s do a simple headcount between India and Pakistan. Currently, India’s GDP is $3.7 trillion—the fifth largest in the world and the only one after the US to outstrip its former colonial rulers. Pakistan, meanwhile, is a $375 billion economy—not even 10% of India’s size. India’s digital economy is booming, startups are thriving, and infrastructure is expanding at a record pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s economy is lurching from one IMF bailout to another like a tippler looking for his next drink.Pakistan is essentially running on loans. The country has over $125 billion in external debt, with crippling inflation and foreign reserves barely enough to cover a few weeks of imports. It defaulted on several payments before being saved by yet another IMF bailout. India, by contrast, is not only managing its debt prudently but has become a net lender to the IMF.As for the contrasting militaries, there’s a delightful anecdote from 1957 recalled by Anvar Alikhan in apiece titled, where he draws parallels between the militaries of the two countries.He writes: “A true story: In 1957, the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , visiting the office of General Thimayya, the Chief of the Army Staff, saw a steel cabinet behind his desk and asked the general what it contained. The general replied that the top drawer contained the nation’s defence plans. And the second drawer contained the confidential files of the nation’s top generals. And what about the third drawer, enquired Nehru. Ah, said the general with a straight face, the third drawer contains my secret plans for a military coup against you. Nehru laughed, but there was apparently a tinge of nervousness to his laughter.”While the idea of a military coup in India remained a joke locked in a cabinet, in Pakistan, the military was so good at dealing with law and order and other issues that whenever martial law was declared, people would rejoice: “” playing on the termWhile India became a nuclear-armed democracy—warts and all—Pakistan devolved into a de facto military state whose generals always had more power than elected officials. Coups happened with the alacrity of Friday prayers. In fact, Imran Khan was propped up by the military to counter mainstream politicians, but the former World Cup winner soon became more powerful than his puppeteers intended. Yet, a country where the army decides your prime minister, your policies, and sometimes even your breakfast menu is apparently living its best life.Yes, India’s secularism is under scrutiny and faces legitimate criticism. But it still remains a constitutionally enshrined, functioning democracy with an independent judiciary, regular elections, and a diverse press. Pakistan, in contrast, is a state founded on religious identity and has institutionalised discrimination against minorities. Ahmadiyyas can’t even call themselves Muslim, and Hindus are regularly persecuted. Minorities live under a blasphemy law that’s been used more as a weapon than a shield.So, how exactly does a theocracy with enforced religious conformity and institutional bigotry outscore a pluralist democracy—even if imperfect?India is seen as a rising power on the global stage. It’s hosting G20 summits, mediating in global conflicts, and pushing for a multipolar world. Pakistan, meanwhile, is often the subject of IMF reports, FATF warnings, and UN human rights resolutions. India’s passport opens doors; Pakistan’s passport raises eyebrows.In fact, the contrast between India and Pakistan can even be seen in both nations’ favourite pastimes: cricket. In recent years, much to the chagrin of English and Australian columnists, India has become the de facto Trump of world cricket —big enough to call the shots—so much so that when Pakistan finally got the chance to host a Champions Trophy, India refused to set foot. While the Pakistani team went out dismally in the group stage, India romped home to pick up the trophy without as much as breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury, India’s dominance meant that Pakistan (the hosts) had to travel to Dubai to play its match, and India reaching the final robbed Pakistan of the spectacle.India’s changed standing on the global stage can be summarised by the contrasting online reaction to a tweet from an American commentator with a Ukraine flag (a marker of online inanity), which wondered why there was no outrage when Prime Minister Modi (like Zelenskyy) wasn’t dressed in a suit. Most commentators pointed out that Modi was dressed in traditional garb (a kurta pyjama and a jacket) as opposed to Zelenskyy’s cosplay sweatshirt and khakis. However, the real kicker was even white Americans—who often spend time mocking JD Vance’s wife —defended the Indian Prime Minister because he wasn’t in America asking for more funds and weapons.The implication that India—a growing economy, a space-faring democracy, and a hub of innovation—is less “happy” than war-torn or economically collapsed nations raises serious questions about the methodology behind these rankings. The report relied heavily on subjective self-assessments, primarily via Gallup’s “Cantril Ladder,” where respondents rated their lives on a scale from 0 to 10. These were then modelled against six variables: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. However, many of these variables were based more on perceptions than hard data. In societies where expectations are low, or media is tightly controlled, people often report higher satisfaction. In contrast, in dynamic democracies like India, rising aspirations, political noise, and media scrutiny tend to yield harsher self-assessments—even in the midst of tangible progress.All of this brought renewed attention to the flaws of international perception-based indices—something Sanjeev Sanyal and Aakanksha Arora had flagged in a 2022 working paper . They had offered a pointed critique of three influential global indices: Freedom in the World (by Freedom House), Democracy Index (by the Economist Intelligence Unit), and the V-Dem Indices (by the University of Gothenburg)—all of which had routinely rated India poorly.Sanyal-Arora had argued that these indices were largely opinion-driven, relying on small, opaque pools of anonymous “experts” whose identities, qualifications, and nationalities were often undisclosed. Freedom House, for instance, used 25 subjective questions assessed by internal analysts and external advisers, but published no transparency on scoring mechanisms. The EIU claimed to use public opinion, yet India’s last World Values Survey input dated back to 2012—meaning more recent assessments were based almost entirely on expert opinion. V-Dem, meanwhile, used 473 variables, many of them highly subjective, including notions like “self-censorship” or “deliberative quality of governance.”They also noted that many of the questions used were ill-suited for cross-country comparisons, such as “how pervasive is corruption?” or “to what extent is direct popular vote utilised?”—metrics that penalised democracies like India and the US for not holding national referendums, while awarding higher scores to one-party states like Cuba.India and Pakistan are on two different trajectories, and even the honest Pakistani knows that. If Albert Camus was right, then perhaps the secret to happiness lies not in prosperity, democracy, or purpose—but in the acceptance of futility, the repetition of struggle, and the knowledge that there is no divine reward at the summit.In, Camus describes a man condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain, only for it to roll back down each time. It is an absurd fate, but in contemplating it—knowing it is his, accepting it as unchangeable—Sisyphus becomes, paradoxically, free. Camus writes: “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”Perhaps this, then, explains Pakistan’s higher ranking in the World Happiness Report 2025. Perhaps Pakistan is the Sisyphus of South Asia. A nation locked in a cycle of economic collapse, military coups, IMF bailouts, energy shortages, and cricketing heartbreak, and yet—it smiles on the way back down the hill.Where India fights, debates, builds, reforms, and aspires—Pakistan accepts. It no longer expects the summit. Its happiness is not driven by achievement but by survival, not by growth but by repetition. Where India agonises over its democracy, Pakistan no longer pretends to have one. Where India chases global leadership, Pakistan is content negotiating its next loan. There is peace in low expectations, freedom in detachment. If happiness is the absence of disillusionment, then what better strategy than to stop being illusioned in the first place?And so, while Indians grumble through traffic jams in growing cities, rage against corruption, or demand better governance, Pakistanis return to their rock each morning, lift it with muscle memory, and smile—because nothing else was promised. As Camus wrote: “Each atom of that stone... forms a world.”Every bailout is a new beginning. Every coup, a cosmic reset. Every World Cup loss, a philosophical cleansing. They roll the rock. It rolls back. The absurd cycle is complete.

Donald Trump extends White House invite to Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes in unexpected move



The Kansas City Chiefs are set to receive a long-overdue honor as former President Donald Trump has extended an invitation to celebrate their Super Bowl LIV victory at the White House. The unexpected move comes five years after the Chiefs’ championship win was overshadowed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, preventing them from visiting Washington, D.C., at the time. Now, Trump aims to rectify the missed opportunity by welcoming Patrick Mahomes , Travis Kelce , and the rest of the Chiefs roster after hosting this year’s Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles .On February 2, 2020, the Chiefs secured a historic victory over the San Francisco 49ers at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, lifting their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. However, just weeks later, the world was brought to a standstill by the coronavirus outbreak, leading to the cancellation of their traditional championship visit to the White House. While other Super Bowl winners in subsequent years were able to partake in the ceremonial tradition, Kansas City was left without the recognition that many teams before and after them received.In a conversation with OutKick founder Clay Travis aboard Air Force One, Trump addressed the situation and outlined his plans for upcoming celebrations. ""I look forward to having the [Philadelphia Eagles],"" Trump stated, adding, ""And one other thing, we're going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that because they missed their turn because of COVID."" The Chiefs, who recently suffered a heavy defeat against the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, are yet to publicly comment on the invitation, but the possibility of finally closing this chapter in their franchise history remains on the table.The announcement adds an interesting dimension given the political backdrop surrounding key figures within the Chiefs organization. Travis Kelce, who is in a highly publicized relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, finds himself at the center of intrigue. Swift was an outspoken critic of Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 election, openly endorsing Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party. Kelce, on the other hand, maintained a neutral stance on political matters, emphasizing his excitement about the game itself when asked about Trump’s attendance at the Super Bowl. ""That's awesome. It's a great honor,"" Kelce said at the time. ""I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life.""Trump's admiration for the Mahomes family also adds another layer to the story. The former president has been vocal about his appreciation for quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ mother, Randi, and his wife, Brittany. ""I love those two women. They're so great and so loyal. I met Patrick's mother... at the game [the Super Bowl],"" Trump remarked. ""She came over. And Brittany, I've seen so much of Brittany that just, you know, being so loyal and great and beautiful.""The Chiefs’ previous White House visits came under President Joe Biden in 2023 and 2024 after their consecutive Super Bowl victories. Now, under a different administration, the dynamics surrounding their potential visit introduce an element of curiosity and speculation. If they do accept Trump’s invitation, the event will undoubtedly generate significant public and media attention.Also Read: ""My heart goes out to you!”: Donna Kelce shares heartfelt message to Kylie Kelce after tragic loss As of now, no official date has been set for the Chiefs’ White House visit, and the team has yet to publicly confirm their acceptance of Trump’s invitation. With many eyes on how the players, particularly Kelce, will navigate this political landscape, the visit—if it takes place—will be more than just a sports celebration. It will be a moment of historical reflection, political undertones, and perhaps, a testament to the unifying power of sports despite personal and ideological differences.","Donald trump extends white house invite to travis kelce and patrick mahomes in unexpected move.

Northville coach fired after controversial incident

Brett Favre applauds the school’s swift action

A shocking incident in high school basketball has sparked widespread outrage, with former Northville coach Jim Zullo fired for grabbing a player’s ponytail after a championship loss. NFL legend Brett Favre weighed in, applauding the school's swift action.During the New York Class D state championship game, Northville suffered a tough loss to La Fargeville. However, what happened after the game became an even bigger story.As the players walked off the court, Jim Zullo was caught on video grabbing senior player Hailey Monroe by her ponytail. The footage quickly went viral, sparking outrage from the public and sports figures alike.In response to the backlash, Northville School District released a statement emphasizing that they are taking the matter seriously and will be following up with the affected players and their families.""We assure the public that this matter is being taken extremely seriously, and the District is actively addressing it. The District will be following up with the affected players and their families to provide support and outline the actions we are taking in response to this incident.""Among those who reacted strongly to the situation was NFL Hall-of-Famer Brett Favre, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his disapproval. ""This one really surprised me. No room for this, and good on the school for acting quickly,"" Favre posted.Zullo later defended his actions, claiming that Monroe had directed an expletive at him after he told her to shake hands with the opposing team. However, this explanation did little to change the public’s perception of the incident.The swift firing of Zullo signals the school district’s zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior toward student-athletes.In a separate controversy involving Brett Favre, former New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau has filed a $25-million lawsuit against ESPN for using footage of his confrontation with Favre without permission.The encounter, which took place at the Chicago Sports Spectacular event in 2023, stemmed from a long-standing grievance. Gastineau confronted Favre over an infamous moment in 2001, when Favre seemingly took a dive to allow Michael Strahan to break Gastineau’s single-season sack record.Also Read: ""You can't stop me"": Kylie Kelce reveals bold plan to induce labor by running sprints at 38 weeks pregnant with baby No. 4 The footage of this heated exchange was later featured in ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary, The New York Sack Exchange.

As of now, ESPN has not commented on the lawsuit.","High school basketball coach jim zullo was fired for grabbing a player's ponytail after a championship loss.

Police are now investigating the sudden death of the high-profile lawyer, who was just 43 years old.According to reports, officers from the Alexandria police department discovered Aber’s body shortly before 9:20 am after receiving a call about an ""unresponsive woman."" The circumstances surrounding her death remain under investigation, and the official cause will be determined by the Virginia medical examiner’s office, as per the New York Post.Aber, a Biden appointee , resigned from her position in January following the transition of power to President Donald Trump. She had a distinguished legal career, serving as an assistant US attorney in the district from 2009 before taking on a role as counsel to the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Criminal Division in 2015. In 2021, she was nominated by President Joe Biden for the top prosecutor role in the Eastern District of Virginia and was confirmed unanimously by the senate.US Attorney Erik Siebert, who currently holds the position, expressed deep sorrow over Aber’s passing in a statement on Saturday afternoon.“We are heartbroken beyond words to learn of the passing of our friend and former colleague, US Attorney Jessica Aber.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them. Around 200 members of Venezuela's notorious prison gang Tren de Aragua have been sent to El Salvador, though according to claims some among them are not gang members.The UK government's ""foreign travel advice"" for the US warns travelers to ""comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry.

What is US Gold Card?



Donald Trump's Gold Card visa needs an individual to pay straight $5 million to get US citizenship while the administration is concentrating on sweeping the 'illegal' ones out. While the program triggered discussions on whether it is too expensive for US citizenship, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said he sold 1,000 Gold Cards a day. ""There are 37 million people in the world who are capable of buying the card... The president thinks we can sell a million,"" Lutnick said speaking on All-In Podcast.Lutnick said Trump got the idea of the Gold Card during a meeting he had with investor John Paulson. Lutnick was then taken in the loop to figure out how to do it. Elon Musk is building the software, Lutnick said.On why anyone should buy the Gold Card, Lutnick said had he not been an American, he would have bought six Gold Cards, one for him, one for his wife and other family members -- so that if something happens like war or any other crisis, he could have come to the US and start afresh -- starting a new business.Lutnick elaborated that the Gold Card would replace the traditional green card, granting holders permanent US residency. While cardholders could pursue citizenship, he suggested most would opt against it to avoid US global taxation. Priced at $5 million each, the cards would offer the right to live in the US indefinitely.Prices at $5 million, the Gold Card program would replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa program. EB-5s were created in 1990 as a method for immigrants to obtain green cards in which a person must invest at least $1 million in a company –or $800k in a low-income area – that employs at least 10 people. In 2024, more than 4,500 EB-5 visas were issued.Trump said there would be no cap on the number of gold cards issued.","Commerce secretary howard lutnick said he sold 1,000 gold card a day.

There is an urgent need to safeguard the sect from disappearing.""Ranjeet Singh, a former Member of Parliament from Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, representing Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), informed that the Bhagat Panthi sect is also referred to as ‘ Mona Sikhs ’ in the region. He said that their population is now primarily concentrated in cities such as Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Kohat.“There are around 150 to 200 families of Bhagat Panthis in Jogia Wala Mohalla of Dera Ismail Khan. They practice both Sikhism and Hinduism, recite Japji Sahib, and maintain the parkash of the Geeta in the Jogi Wala Temple, while also paying obeisance to Sri Guru Granth Sahib,” he added.The majority of Bhagat Panthis are now shorn and continue to practice their traditions. They do not perform the ""shradh"" rituals for the deceased, and they reject the concept of untouchability. However, over time, they faced persecution, which led many of them to either convert to Islam, embrace Hinduism, or migrate to the Punjab province of Pakistan, where there is a significant Sikh population, or to India. Despite these challenges, they managed to retain certain elements of their cultural and spiritual practices.Dalip Singh said that they held a meeting with senior members of their sect to discuss the decline of various Sikh sects, particularly those that once flourished in Pakistan. ""Regarding the Bhagat Panthis, we are considering sending a delegation to Pakistan to visit areas such as Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Kohat, where a significant population of Bhagat Panthis once resided, but there is no trace of them left today,"" he said.Extending their support to the Bhagat Panthis, Dalip Singh said that their goal is not to impose keeping hair or initiation upon them, but to ensure that the Bhagat Panth continues to thrive and follow the traditions they have upheld for generations, rather than disappearing. He said that while 'kesadhari' (with hair) Sikhs number approximately 2.5 crore worldwide, the followers of Guru Nanak (whether turbaned or not) number over 50 crore globally.A Sikh leader from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sant Singh Kumar, said that the Bhagat Panthis celebrate both Gurpurabs as well as festivals like Holi, Diwali, and other cultural occasions, and now identify themselves as 'Mona Sikhs.'He said that since they live in terrorist-infested areas which are in close proximity to Afghanistan, many of them embraced other religions, including Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity, for safety and survival. Kumar also praised the efforts announced by a Dalip Singh-led faction of the Namdhari sect, aimed at supporting the Bhagat Panthis and preventing their disappearance.","The bhagat panthi sect once thrived in the sindh region of bharat (undivided india), but today, only a handful of its members remain due to various challenges.

Why Netanyahu dismissed Shin Bet chief

Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara , on Sunday, days after the High Court of Justice, Israel's highest court, temporarily blocked the cabinet's dismissal of internal security head Ronen Bar over his failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas in Israel.Baharav-Miara had openly cautioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against trying to replace Bar, the director of Shin Bet , whose dismissal from service was the first in the agency's history.Ahead of the vote on Baharav-Miara, protesters held demonstrations outside the Knesset and the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem, leading to scuffles with police, according to news agency AFP.Netanyahu's office, citing a cabinet meeting agenda, had said the government would hold the vote on Baharav-Miara ""due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and its legal adviser"".The unprecedented moves to dismiss the Shin Bet chief and now the attorney general have widened divisions in Israel amid the resumption of its military operations in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.Netanyahu has cited an ""ongoing lack of trust"" in Bar, who is expected to testify on April 8. The Israeli premier has insisted repeatedly ""it is up to the government"" who will head the Shin Bet.However, critics see two main reasons behind Netanyahu moving against Bar.The first was the latter's criticism of the Israeli government over the security failure that allowed the Hamas attack on October 7, the deadliest day in the country's history. The second was Shin Bet's investigation of Netanyahu's close associates on suspicion of receiving money linked to Qatar.Netanyahu's office has dismissed such accusations as ""fake news"".Following the court's initial ruling on Bar, Baharav-Miara said Netanyahu cannot name a new internal security chief.""According to the decision of the Supreme Court, it is prohibited to take any action that harms the position of the head of the Shin Bet, Ronen Bar. It is prohibited to appoint a new head of Shin Bet, and interviews for the position should not be held,"" she said.","Israel's cabinet passed a vote of no confidence in attorney general, gali baharav-miara.
