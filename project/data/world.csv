"Collegium preserves judiciary’s autonomy, say CJI B R Gavai, Justice Kant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collegium-preserves-judiciarys-autonomy-say-cji-b-r-gavai-justice-kant/articleshow/124772986.cms,"NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Thursday stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges and said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.CJI Gavai was speaking at Royal Institute of Management in Thimphu, Bhutan, while Justice Kant was addressing Sri Lankan Supreme Court in Colombo. The CJI cited SC’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission and said granting primary control over judicial appointments to the executive would imperil the independence and autonomy of the judiciary.Justice Kant said the judiciary’s dominant role in appointment of judges to HCs and SC is a compelling “illustration of the doctrine of separation of powers”. The judiciary’s independence and autonomy help it to go beyond simple resolution of disputes or defending constitutional boundaries; it has allowed constitutional courts actively “shape the democratic imagination of a society and to function as architects of democratic life”, he held.Justice Kant said that if separation of powers is the framework of India’s constitutional democracy, then judicial review — Article 32 (a person can approach SC directly over violation of fundamental rights) and Article 226 (a person can file a writ petition in an HC) — is the sustaining force of democracy.The ambit of judicial review extends to constitutional functionaries like EC, Lok Sabha speaker and governors, as well as legislative assemblies. “No act of governance is beyond the purview of judicial oversight,” he stressed.“This expansive power of review is a cornerstone of India’s constitutional democracy and a part of our basic structure, affirming that legality and constitutionality are fundamental preconditions to the exercise of public power,” Justice Kant said.In what reflects the judiciary’s transformative potential to give voice to the voiceless, Justice Kant said, judicial interpretation has resulted in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, leading to legislative action.CJI Gavai said that apart from the broad and purposive interpretation of Article 21 (right to life), SC has consistently held the state accountable for safeguarding and promoting the rights of citizens, compelling govts to translate constitutional guarantees into tangible actions.Public interest litigation (PIL) has evolved as an instrument for protecting human rights and the rights of marginalised and vulnerable communities like bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, migrant workers, manual scavengers, sex workers and pavement dwellers. SC has also brought in electoral reforms by acting on PILs, the CJI said.Justice Kant disagreed with criticism that judicial activism often results in encroachment of the turfs of legislature and executive, and said, “When courts act to empower the powerless, grounded in constitutional text and moral clarity, they do not usurp democracy, they deepen it.”Both the CJI and Justice Kant referred to SC’s landmark 13-judge judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973 that established the doctrine of ‘basic structure of the Constitution’. “That judgment transformed the judiciary from a mere interpreter of the Constitution into its guardian,” Justice Kant said.","Cji b r gavai and justice surya kant, the next cji, stoutly defended the much-criticised collegium system for selecting constitutional court judges. They said it has helped the judiciary preserve its autonomy and independence in administration of justice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124772954,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24012,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

""They are going to stop..."" Trump Reiterates Claim That India Is Cutting Down Russian Oil Imports





NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending Russian crude imports after the US on Wednesday sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, the largest exporters of those barrels.Reliance, the single-largest Indian consumer of Russian oil, will be the biggest loser as it buys most of those barrels directly from Rosneft under a term contract. Russian crude makes up about half of the feed at the company's 35-million-tonne complex.“Recalibration of Russian oil imports is ongoing and Reliance will be fully aligned to GOI (Government of India) guidelines,” a Reliance spokesman told Reuters.The curbs on Rosneft will also make life harder for Nayara Energy, which is half owned by the Russian giant and struggling to stay afloat since September when the EU imposed sanctions. Analysts said selling products from its 20-million-tonne refinery at Gujarat's Vadinar will be tough.Importers can receive contracted shipments till November 21. Unlike previous sanctions, when Russian oil could be traded within the $60 price cap, this time the curbs are directed at the companies, making their barrel tainted after the cut-off date.So far this year, 36% of India’s crude has been from Russia, with Rosneft and Lukoil supplying nearly 60% of this.A senior executive of IndianOil, one of the largest consumers of Russian oil among state-run refiners, said those barrels make up 15-18% of their crude basket.“It is too early. We are looking at the fine print. But it will not be too difficult to arrange alternative supplies from West Asia or other geographies such as Africa, the US etc. But others will also be crowding those markets, which will jack up benchmark prices and premia on other crude. This will impact margins. But Russian oil somehow finds its way into the market as we have seen in the past… but banking issues may crop up,” he said.Sure enough, benchmark Brent crude price shot up 5%, or by $2.9 a barrel, to 65.50 on Thursday. ""The good thing is prices are in their 60s. Even if they rise to $70, it will be manageable.""US President Donald Trump has been mounting pressure on countries such as India and China to lower oil imports from Russia as part of a plan to squeeze Moscow to come to the negotiating table on the Ukraine conflict. Trump imposed secondary tariffs of 25% on India, in addition to 25% reciprocal tariffs, citing Russian crude purchases.Late Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hit back at the US. “This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure.” He said breaking the balance in the global energy markets could lead to a hike in prices that would be uncomfortable for countries such as the US.As a country, the loss of discounted Russian oil could potentially cost India, which meets 85% of its crude requirement through imports, an estimated annual savings of about $4-5 billion on its oil import bill. Ratings agency ICRA estimates that replacement supplies at market prices would increase the oil import bill by 2%, potentially impacting the macroeconomic parameters.Sumit Ritolia, analyst at global real-time data and analytics provider Kpler, said the term arrangement with Rosneft could “introduce some near-term friction, especially from a compliance standpoint for RIL. The company would understandably wish to avoid any exposure to OFAC (US Office of Foreign Assets Control) and it will need to look at its Russian crude strategy.”The immediate operational impact on state-run refiners, he said, ""should remain limited"" as they buy Russian crude through tender from third-party traders. “However, secondary sanctions related to logistics and financing could pose indirect challenges.”","Reliance industries and state-run refiners are looking at suspending russian crude imports.

Poll Should law enforcement agencies take stronger measures against organized crime? Yes, definitely No, it's not necessary





NEW DELHI: Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara, highlighting an ongoing transnational gang feud.In a social media post, the men named Mahender Saran Dilana, Rahul Rinau, and Vicky Phalwan said Kahlon was targeted for allegedly supplying weapons and money to rival gangs and acting as an informant.""We carried out the shooting in Canada at Teji Kahlon. He was shot in the stomach. If he understands, fine. If not, next time we will finish him,"" the statement read.The post accused Kahlon of providing financial support and arms to competing gangs and of informing on their members. Local authorities in Canada are investigating the attack.Earlier this month, 40-year-old businessman Ramesh Rulania was shot dead while exercising at a gym in Rajasthan’s Kuchaman town.Police said the assailant entered the gym around 5:20 am and shot Rulania at close range before fleeing. CCTV footage captured the gunman entering the premises shortly before the attack.Officials suspect the murder may be connected to an extortion threat Rulania had received from the Rohit Godara gang, which operates across western Rajasthan, including Didwana and Kuchaman districts. Several other businessmen in the region have reportedly received similar threats.Rohit Godara, also known as Rawatram Swami, is a notorious gangster from Lunkaransar in Bikaner.Police say he may be linked to several high-profile killings, including the December 2022 murder of gangster Raju Thehat in Sikar, the May 2022 killing of popular Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, and the December 2023 killing of Karni Sena chief Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi—both of which Godara reportedly claimed responsibility for.",Punjabi singer teji kahlon was shot in canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster rohit godara.

"PM Modi to attend Asean summit virtually, Congress takes a swipe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-attend-asean-summit-virtually-congress-takes-a-swipe/articleshow/124772222.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi spoke to his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim and conveyed that he will virtually attend India-Asean summit Sunday, scotching speculation of a meeting with US President Donald Trump on the margins of Asean and East Asia summits in Kuala Lumpur.The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by Modi might be preoccupation with Bihar assembly elections but it also spares him the discomfiture of running into the mercurial president in the middle of a US-India trade deadlock and growing differences over Pakistan-related issues.According to Ibrahim, Modi told him he would attend virtually “given Deepavali festival was still being celebrated in India at that time”. “I respect the decision and extend my Deepavali greetings to him and all the people of India,” said Ibrahim on X. In his own post on the same platform, Modi congratulated Ibrahim on Malaysia’s Asean chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits.“Look forward to deepening of Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Modi. MEA later said in a statement that foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent Modi at East Asia Summit on Oct 27.In their conversation late on Wednesday, Ibrahim said India remains an important partner of Malaysia in trade and investment, technology, education and regional security sectors.Meanwhile, Congress on Thursday said the PM decided against visiting Malaysia to avoid “being cornered by Trump” and asked if this was the reason Modi did not travel to Egypt for Gaza peace summit helmed by Trump a few days back.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said Modi posting messages in praise of Trump on social media is one thing but to be seen hobnobbing in person with a man who has “claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and has claimed five times that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia” is another matter which “is far too risky for him”.",The ostensible reason for the rare miss to the summit by modi might be preoccupation with bihar assembly elections.

GBMES will provide round-the-clock electronic intelligence of enemy emitters. HMVs, in turn, will significantly improve logistical support in diverse geographical terrains,” the official said.Apart from LPDs, the Navy will also get 30mm surface guns at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore for low-intensity maritime operations and anti-piracy roles; advanced light-weight torpedoes for anti-submarine warfare; electro-optical infra-red search and track systems; and smart ammunition for 76mm super rapid gun mounts on warships.","The biggest project to get the “acceptance of necessity’ (aon) was for the construction of four large amphibious warfare ships or “landing platform docks (lpds) another mega project to be cleared was the acquisition of a large number of surface-to-air missiles for the s-400 triumf air defence systems for over rs 10,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124770554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-717429,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The commission has also sought action taken reports from the authorities in this regard.Of the 3,639 deaths reported due to exposure to cold between 2019 and 2023, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data on accidental deaths, UP reported the maximum number (797), followed by Punjab (734), Bihar (589), Jharkhand (515) and Haryana (320). Among union territories, Ladakh reported as many as 58 deaths.If one looks at causes attributable to ‘forces of nature’ in NCRB’s latest ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ report for 2023, the number of deaths due to ‘heat/sun stroke’, ‘exposure to cold’ and tornado increased over 2022.

NEW DELHI: India may soon adopt stricter rules for power banks on board aircraft following recent instances worldwide, including one in the country, of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.On Sunday, a passenger’s power bank caught fire on a Dimapur-bound IndiGo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at Delhi airport. Now, Directorate General of Civil Aviation is “taking up this issue”, said a senior official.The regulator is learnt to be taking technical inputs on the issue. Foreign airlines are increasingly putting restrictions on power banks. Some require the power bank to be kept in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front and not in overhead bins.From Oct 1, Dubai-based Emirates “prohibited” use any power bank. While it allows a passenger to carry one power bank under 100 Watt Hours, they can neither use it to charge a device, nor charge the power bank in the aircraft cabin. The new regulations also mandate that “all power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available”.Most phones and sophisticated lithium battery-powered devices have an internal trickle system that slowly adds current into the battery to prevent overcharging, but many basic power banks may not have this safeguard.Singapore Airlines from April 1 did not allow flyers to charge power banks via onboard USB ports, or use them to charge their devices.Last week, there was a lithium battery fire on an Air China flight from China to South Korea, forcing it to be diverted to Shanghai.","On sunday, a passenger’s power bank caught fire on a dimapur-bound indigo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at delhi airport.

"No discussion on Pakistan in Modi-Trump phone call, says government; PM may address Asean virtually",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-discussion-on-pakistan-in-modi-trump-phone-call-says-government-pm-may-address-asean-virtually/articleshow/124747878.cms,"PM Modi Confirmed to Give ASEAN Summit a Miss, Avoids Trump Again: Here’s The Real Reason Why

Despite the recent show of bonhomie between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.It’s also learnt that India is exploring the possibility of Modi addressing the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings in Malaysia virtually later this week, apparently because of the elections in Bihar. This would rule out any likelihood in the near future of an in-person encounter with Trump. The US president said this week he will be in Malaysia for the annual event. He is unlikely to travel though to South Africa for the G20 summit next month, where Modi will be present.Modi has rarely skipped in-person participation in the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings. The PM had earlier this month declined Egypt’s invitation for the Gaza peace summit that was co-chaired by Trump. India has not been enthused by the prospect of a meeting with Trump in the absence of any breakthrough in the trade negotiations, as also the president’s claims ad nauseam about having ended a war between India and Pakistan, but government sources said the likely decision to opt out of in-person participation may also be related to the focus on Bihar elections Trump said at a Diwali event on Tuesday that he had spoken to Modi and that they had also discussed the need to avoid a war between India and Pakistan. The PM had later in a post on X expressed hope that the 2 countries will stand united against terrorism in all its forms, venting India’s concerns about Islamabad’s growing proximity with Washington under Trump but without naming Pakistan.“Pakistan was not discussed during the phone call between the PM and President Trump,” said a source here, on condition of anonymity.This was the second time in the past 2 weeks that India has denied Trump’s claim that he has tagged to conversations with Modi. India had said last week it wasn’t aware of the conversation between Modi and Trump during which, according to Trump, the Indian PM assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.The India-US relationship has been making headlines because of the differences over trade but Trump’s unabashed courting of Pakistan has also been a source of unease in bilateral ties for India. Even as India maintains that the ceasefire after Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the 2 militaries, Trump has not backed down from his claim that he ended the conflict with his threat to impose trade tariffs on India and Pakistan. The relationship saw a dramatic downturn after Modi declined Trump’s invitation in June this year to visit the White House. The visit was always a non-starter for Modi, as Pakistan army chief Asim Munir was also being feted there at the same time.",India and the us again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders.

As the United States faces its second-longest government shutdown in recent history, Democrats are urging President Donald Trump to cancel his upcoming trip to Asia and focus on resolving the domestic crisis.The MAGA chief is scheduled to depart late Friday for Malaysia, with stops in Japan and South Korea, where he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next Thursday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “outrageous” for Trump to leave the country while Americans suffer.“Shouldn't the president listen to the cares of the American people and their desperate need on health care, rather than taking a foreign trip?” Schumer asked.Senator Jeff Merkley, who held a marathon speech on the Senate floor in protest of Trump administration policies, described the planned trip as “horrific.”“He absolutely should be sitting down right now and holding a conversation with you about how we solve this problem for millions of Americans,” Merkley said.Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries requested a meeting with Trump earlier this week to discuss ending the shutdown, but Trump responded that he will only meet with Democratic leaders once the government reopens.""I would like to meet with both of them, but I said one little caveat, I will only meet if they let the country open,"" Trump told reporters earlier this week, according to USA Today. Republican lawmakers have largely refused to negotiate until the shutdown ends, while Democrats continue to demand health care reforms in exchange for reopening the government.This will be Trump’s first trip to Asia since returning to the Oval Office in January. In the past, presidents have cancelled international travel during shutdowns. In 2019, amid a 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first term, he reportedly made then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cancel a trip to Brussels and Afghanistan. Similarly, former President Barack Obama cancelled a trip to Indonesia and Brunei during the 17-day 2013 funding impasse, citing the need to press Republicans to allow a vote to reopen the government.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump will depart Friday and meet leaders in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, including Xi Jinping.","President donald trump is scheduled to depart friday for malaysia, with stops in japan and south korea.

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.",President donald trump will meet chinese president xi jinping on october 30.
