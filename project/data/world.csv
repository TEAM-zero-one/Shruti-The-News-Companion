Pakistan train hijack: Jaffar Express a hot target for BLA & TTP for years now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistani-train-hijack-jaffar-express-a-hot-target-for-bla-ttp-for-years-now/articleshow/118910821.cms,"Jaffar Express Hijack (Generative AI image)

In the autumn of 2018, Punjab-bound Jaffar Express had narrowly escaped twin blasts after Baloch rebels attempted to blow up the passenger train using remote-controlled explosive devices. The devices had exploded when the train was about 200 feet away.Tuesday’s attack isn’t an isolated incident. The train often carries personnel of Pakistani forces from Quetta to Punjab and vice versa, making it a hot target for groups like Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan). In 2023, the train was attacked twice in two months and at the same spot.On Jan 19, at least 13 people were injured after a bomb blast derailed the train when it was passing through Bolan district, around 150 km away from Quetta. About a month later, another blast was reported on the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar, killing at least one passenger and injuring a dozen. In Nov last year, at least 26 persons were killed and over 40 were injured, including women and children, in an explosion at Quetta railway station.For over 20 years, BLA has been waging a low-intensity insurgency in Balochistan, relying on traditional guerrilla tactics. However, a significant shift is being witnessed since 2018 as the group has begun employing suicide attacks and planned operations.The first testament to this shift in strategy was seen in Aug 2018 when BLA attacked a bus carrying Chinese engineers. This marked the revival of BLA’s suicide bombing unit, Majeed Brigade, named after a BLA commander killed by Pak military in Quetta in 2010.Since the 2018 attack, BLA has carried out over a dozen major suicide bombings in areas like Gwadar, Karachi, Turbat, Bolan, sending the Pak govt in a tizzy.BLA has also launched an offensive against China-Pakistan Economic Corridor .Last Oct, the Majeed Brigade carried out a ‘suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device’ attack targeting a Chinese convoy of engineers and investors departing from Jinnah International Airport, Karachi. The explosion resulted in around 50 deaths, including Chinese nationals and their security personnel. Bombings at Darul Uloom Haqqania aka ‘University of Jihad’ and killings of clerics like Mufti Shah Mir are recent examples.In 2016, the military had established a “Special Security Division” to protect Chinese expansionist projects and target Baloch political and social activists. Mir was heading one of the death squads formed for this purpose. While BLA poses a significant challenge, it is not the only concern for the Pakistani govt. TTP has also escalated its offensive against Pakistan this year. Last week, over a dozen security personnel were killed in twin suicide bombing attacks at a military base in Bannu.","Train often carries personnel of pakistani forces from quetta to punjab.

Lalit shares Vanuatu broadcaster statement saying citizenship call only after court order

LONDON: Lalit Modi , who is wanted for criminal offences in India, has challenged Vanuatu govt's decision to revoke the passport it had granted him and will argue his case in a court in the south-western Pacific island in person.UK sources close to Modi told TOI on Tuesday that he has filed a case in the Vanuatu court appealing the decision of PM Jotham Napat to cancel his citizenship. Modi, an Indian national, is currently in Vanuatu fighting the case, from where he has been tweeting photos of its beaches and praising it as a “heavenly country”.TOI has learnt that there is no extradition request for Modi as of now. “He went to the high commission of India in London to surrender his Indian passport in order to take up Vanuatu citizenship but they refused to give him a surrender certificate. They said it was because of due diligence and checks had to be made,” a source said.The Vanuatu PM’s office issued a statement on Monday saying Napat had instructed Citizenship Commission to “begin proceedings” to cancel Lalit Modi’s Vanuatu passport. The commission is a constitutional body responsible for reviewing, approving, deferring or rejecting citizenship applications. It also has the power to revoke citizenship if granted in violation of Citizenship Act, or other relevant laws.Lalit shared a statement on his X handle, written by Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation on Facebook in Bislama. The English translation read, “The chairman of Vanuatu Citizenship Commission said his office will wait for outcome of court before making a decision on Lalit Modi’s citizenship as a NiVanuatu. Chairman of citizenship commission Charles Maniel made this statement following an order issued by PM Jotham Napat to Citizenship Commission to start the process of cancelling Lalit’s Vanuatu passport due to some allegations that he is facing in court. Chairman Maniel said if the court finds him guilty, the commission will start the process of cancelling his passport and citizenship as a Ni-Vanuatu. Lalit, who is originally from India, bought his Ni-Vanuatu citizenship through citizenship programme of Vanuatu govt.”",Lalit modi has challenged vanuatu govt's decision to revoke the passport it had granted him.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average pm2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) it was more than 25 times higher than who-recommended level and over three times more than indian ambient air quality standards.

"Air India reputation down the drain? Aging aircraft, old ducts, scaling in pipes and passenger behaviour lead to stink",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aging-aircraft-old-ducts-scaling-in-pipes-and-passenger-behaviour-lead-to-stink/articleshow/118906475.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Clogged toilets are not new to Air India flights, but the legacy of the old govt-run airline has been flushed across to the new Tata Group-owned company, right in the middle of its modernisation and expansion spree.For years, cleanup crew of Air India’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels, plastic bags, underwear and even small pillows given on board.Just as the Chicago-Delhi flight was forced to return to O’Hare International Airport last Wednesday when eight of its 10 lavatories were clogged, over the years, several of the airline’s Europe and US flights have been forced to divert or return after flying for hours with hundreds of bursting bowels and bladders for similar reasons.The dumping has gone on regardless of clear signage asking flyers not to throw anything in the commode as that could “clog the toilet and cause inconvenience to you and your fellow passengers”.As Air India’s legacy Boeing 777s, used for North America nonstops, age, the problem is worsening as the old ducts find it increasingly difficult to suck in whatever indiscreet passengers flush away. “These aircraft are very old. The lavatory ducts or suction pipes have got scaling due to which their available width has reduced. External particles like shawls, sheets or towels easily and immediately clog them up,” said an engineer who has spent decades maintaining aircraft. Aircraft toilets use a vacuum system to remove waste into a storage tank.According to Air India’s former executive director Jitender Bhargava, the airline got 21 of its 23 B777s between 2007 and 2010. The other two were inducted much later and are now used as dedicated long-haul VVIP planes operated by the Indian Air Force. The B787 Dreamliners, used on the Europe, Far East and Australia routes, came in a few years later, starting 2010, and are also getting old now.The problem of clogged toilets has shown up on both these long-haul planes in the airline’s fleet. Due to night curfew in Europe, Air India’s affected B777s have in the past returned to either India or North America after flying hours. An engineer explained, “A B777 has two waste tanks. If a duct leading from a lavatory gets clogged, it will affect only that particular lavatory. But if the duct close to the waste tank inlet gets clogged, it will affect all lavatories connected to it.”On AI 126 being forced to return to Chicago on March 5, Air India said in a statement on Monday, “Our teams found polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing. This led the lavatories to become unserviceable. While not found on AI 126 of March 5, 2025, our teams have previously also found objects such as blankets, innerwear, and diapers, among other waste, having been flushed down the toilets on other flights. We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for.”Is this problem faced by airlines of other countries as well? TOI spoke to officials of multiple leading foreign airlines, who said they have only experienced this problem sporadically. This suggests passengers behave differently in an Indian carrier than when they are aboard a foreign airline.“This is a very, very rare occurrence that can happen anywhere. Sometimes, a couple of lavatories may become unserviceable. If detected before taking off from a place that is not our engineering base, we resort to denied boarding and proportionately reduce the number of passengers on that aircraft,” said an official with a foreign airline.Apart from educating passengers, aircraft maintenance engineers have a word of advice for Air India. “Small bottles are kept in lavatories by AI and almost all other global airlines operating medium to ultra-long hauls. However given the peculiar situation of AI, it will be better to have bigger fixed dispensers that can be refilled by crew as a lot of small bottles end up getting flushed. Ditto for dental hygiene kits but those have to be given,” said an engineer.Crew members say passengers ignore the waste bins, which are right there, below or beside the wash basin, and flush everything down the toilet instead. Toilets in the economy section are more prone to clogging simply because the passenger load is higher. “Given the impact on reputation for Air India, the management must take a call on whether pre-flight instructions by crew should also include what not to flush in the lavs,” said a crew member.","For years, cleanup crew of air india’s long-haul flights has found in holding tanks of blocked lavatories everything from socks to hand towels.

Vanuatu PM drops the hammer

Interpol rejection raises eyebrows

NEW DELHI: Just hours after Vanuatu Prime Minister Jotham Napat ordered the cancellation of Lalit Modi’s passport, the former IPL chief shared breathtaking pictures of the island nation, calling it a “heavenly country” and urging people to visit.""Vanuatu is a beautiful country. You must put it on your bucket list. Away from all the pollution and noise. Truly heavenly country,” Modi wrote, seemingly unfazed by the storm brewing over his citizenship.Earlier today, PM Napat directed the Citizenship Commission to revoke Modi’s passport, citing concerns that the fugitive ex-cricket administrator was attempting to dodge extradition.Also read: 'Attempting to avoid extradition': Vanuatu PM orders cancellation of Lalit Modi's passport Modi, who fled India in 2010 and has been living in London, had filed an application on March 7 with the Indian High Commission in London to surrender his Indian passport. His Vanuatu citizenship—once a safe haven—now appears to be at risk.What makes the case even murkier is that despite India’s efforts, Interpol has twice rejected requests to issue an alert notice against Modi, citing a “lack of substantive judicial evidence.”“While all standard background checks, including Interpol screenings, conducted during his application showed no criminal convictions, I have been made aware in the past 24 hours that Interpol twice rejected Indian authorities' requests,” the Vanuatu PM said in a statement.","Vanuatu pm orders cancellation of lalit modi's passport.

Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





IndusInd Bank's shares dropped 20% on Tuesday, reaching a new 52-week low of Rs 720.50. Multiple brokerages have reduced their ratings and price targets following the discovery of accounting irregularities in the bank's forex derivatives portfolio. On the BSE, IndusInd Bank's shares plunged 22.8 per cent, reaching the lower circuit at Rs 695.25 per piece, marking its 52-week low. The company's shares dropped 21.67 per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), touching a 52-week low of Rs 705.35 apiece. The shares became the biggest decliner amongst the 30 constituents of BSE Sensex.The bank revealed a potential post-tax impact of Rs 15.8 billion, which is 2.35% of its net worth. This has sparked worries about corporate governance and future earnings clarity. IndusInd Bank issued a statement stating that its profitability and capital adequacy levels remain robust enough to withstand this singular impact.The sharp decline in share price followed the bank's disclosure on Monday evening regarding valuation inconsistencies in internal foreign exchange derivative transactions over a 5-7 year period. The financial impact will be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to an ET report.This revelation coincides with existing investor concerns after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) limited IndusInd Bank's CEO Sumant Kathpalia's extension to one year, despite the board's request for a three-year term.Also Read | Elon Musk, world’s richest person, loses $120 billion! Why Tesla CEO’s net worth is taking a hit In light of recent events, Motilal Oswal has revised downwards its stance on IndusInd Bank to 'Neutral', adjusting the target price to Rs 925. The firm acknowledges that whilst accounting irregularities will affect short-term results, the bank's future leadership planning and resolution of governance issues could facilitate improvement.""The recent accounting discrepancies related to derivative transactions have further dampened sentiments and are likely to drive losses in 4QFY25 as the bank absorbs the impact through its P&L. We expect the stock to react negatively to this development. However, we believe the board will expedite the process of evaluating both internal and external candidates for a suitable successor, which should help alleviate concerns and improve confidence in the bank's operations,"" the brokerage was quoted as saying.Following multiple adverse developments, including the CFO's departure, limited CEO tenure extension and forex derivative markdown, Nuvama has reduced its rating for IndusInd Bank to 'Reduce' from 'Hold'. The target price has been lowered to Rs 750, with expectations of sustained pressure on earnings.Also Read | RIL shares plunge 25% from peak!

Emkay Global downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Add' from 'Buy' and slashed its target price by 22% to Rs 875, citing the forex derivative loss and the uncertainty surrounding the final external audit report due in Q4FY25.Given the substantial decline of 47% over the past year and an additional 20% decrease on Tuesday, some brokerage firms anticipate limited potential gains from present valuations, whilst concerns regarding trustworthiness and uncertain profit outlook continue to pose significant challenges.Financial experts emphasise that improvement in share performance will be contingent upon three crucial factors: the results of the independent audit assessment, leadership transition arrangements, and the institution's capability to demonstrate robust corporate governance practices to its stakeholders, says the report.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch!","Multiple brokerages have reduced their ratings and price targets.

Jaffar Express hijacked

NEW DELHI: Following the deadly attack on the Jaffar Express in Balochistan, former Jammu and Kashmir director general of police (DGP) SP Vaid has claimed that Pakistan's government and military have lost control over the region.""Pakistan's army and government have no control over Balochistan. In such a situation, it is not surprising that all this is happening. Pakistan is on the verge of breaking up,"" he said.He further pointed out that just days ago, various militant organisations in Balochistan and Sindh joined forces to challenge the sovereignty of the Pakistani government and army. ""I will not be surprised if Pakistan breaks into four pieces,"" he added.Speaking on the ongoing insurgency, Vaid elaborated how Pakistan’s Senate member Maulana Fazlur Rehman had earlier admitted that six to seven districts in Balochistan were entirely under the control of terrorists.Echoing similar concerns, retired Indian Army officer Major General GD Bakshi said that Balochistan had slipped out of Pakistan’s control, exposing the weakness of its military. He described the train attack as a major development that revealed deep-seated instability.""The train hijack in Balochistan is very significant. A train has 450-500 people, and they have taken them as hostages. Hostage rescue is a very delicate operation, and I don’t think the Pakistan Army can carry it out without major casualties. These are precision operations that our NSG does well, but the Pakistani army's approach is crude, often relying on heavy artillery.""Bakshi also suggested that the Baloch insurgency had reached a tipping point, with militant groups openly challenging the state. ""I think the time for the birth of Balochistan has come,"" he said, warning that the Pakistan Army may resort to drastic measures to divert attention from its failures.""We have to remain careful at our borders because the Pak Army may do anything to shift focus"", he added.The crisis in Balochistan escalated on Tuesday when the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) derailed the Jaffar Express in Bolan, attacking the train and taking over 100 passengers hostage. The group claimed to have killed 20 Pakistani soldiers and even shot down a military drone.According to a statement by the BLA, ""Among the hostages are active-duty personnel from the Pakistani military, police, Anti-Terrorism Force (ATF), and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), all of whom were traveling to Punjab on leave. If the Pakistani forces attempt any military intervention, all hostages will be executed.""The Baloch insurgency has been a long-running issue, with separatist groups demanding independence and greater control over the province’s rich natural resources. With the latest train attack, tensions have further intensified, raising concerns over Pakistan’s ability to maintain its territorial integrity.","‘won’t be surprised if pakistan breaks into four pieces,’ says ex-j&k dgp after balochistan train hijack.

She wondered whether Gogoi would also apologise for abusing the PM on previous occasions.Sitharaman said the opposition has abused Modi who has not even been allowed to speak in the House on occassions. ""They stood in the Well and shouted. Will the honourable member Gogoi apologise for the number of times they have abused the prime minister. Today, he is whitewashing all that. That is not allowed.

He had a heated exchange with opposition members and asserted that he cannot be shouted down by them, to which Gogoi finally addressed Birla to ask whether he was chairman or it was Dubey. That saw Dubey going silent and remained seated till the end of Gogoi’s speech.Birla advised Gogoi to keep to the topic listed for discussion and not deviate, to which the Congress MP contended that, he was speaking on Manipur and wanted to know why the budget had to be passed in Parliament and not in the state assembly.","Sitharaman said the opposition has abused modi who has not even been allowed to speak in the house on occassions.

What is the row over Mahmoud Khalil? What we know so far

Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter questioned the arrest and the following discussion over the possibility of deporting Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student who was arrested for pro-Palestinian protests on campuses last year. Khalil was arrested by the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) over the weekend and even President Donald Trump made a social media post mentioning Khalil's name -- blowing the issue out of proportion as his administration is trying to make an example out of Khalil. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said visas or green cards of such Hamas supporters will be revoked so that they can be deported.Khalil's lawyer Amy Greer said Khalil is a green card holder and he was arrested even after she mentioned the legality of his citizenship to the administration.“There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the First Amendment?” Coulter said on the social platform X in response to a report from the New York Post. The First Amendment is the right to free speech.After Ann Coulter's post, social media users noted that even Ann Coulter, known for her hard-line anti-migration stance, is uneasy with the Trump administration's plan to deport a green card holder.Mahmoud Khalil completed his master's degree from Columbia University in December. Before Columbia, he held multiple roles in international development including with the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. He studied for his bachelor's degree in computer science from Lebanese American University, Beirut. Born in Syria, Khalil is a green card holder and is a US citizen, married to an American.Khalil was at the forefront of the pro-Palestine protests that rocked the campuses last year. He was suspended by his university and was then reinstated.Trump said Khalil's arrest is the first arrest of many to come. ""Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,"" Trump wrote.A federal judge in New York blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil for the time being -- until the court's next order.",Right-wing commentator and writer ann coulter questioned the arrest and the following discussion over the possibility of deporting mahmoud khalil.

Wayne Gretzky’s role and the impact of celebrity endorsements

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.
