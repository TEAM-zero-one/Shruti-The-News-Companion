NEW DELHI: Taking note of the days-long ordeal faced by passengers due to mass cancellation of IndiGo flights, the parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders, including sector regulator DGCA and officials from aviation ministry. The panel, headed by Sanjay Kumar Jha of JDU, will not only seek explanations but also explore solutions to ensure that such disruptions do not occur again, sources said.TOI learnt that while some panel members themselves faced inconvenience due to sudden flight cancellations, others received calls detailing how the crisis derailed travel plans of thousands of passengers.“This is an unprecedented situation in the history of India’s aviation sector. Both the airlines and the regulator will have to explain why such a situation occurred and why they failed to anticipate it,” said a member of the panel.Another member said the episode has exposed deeper systemic issues of the aviation sector, including manpower shortages, strained crew-management systems and gaps in regulatory oversight. The panel will also discuss how rival airlines ‘increased fares abnormally to make undue profit’.","The parliamentary panel on transport, tourism and civil aviation will soon summon all airlines and other stakeholders.

Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

MUMBAI: An Embraer E175LR private jet was rushed to Guwahati on Saturday to bring back 36 children of top corporate executives after they were stranded in Kaziranga when IndiGo cancelled its flights. The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in India as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.“Typical movements included Delhi-Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, all popular wedding destinations, apart from Hyderabad and Chennai,” said Gautam Sahni of Noida-based Subha Aviation, which specialises in airline charters. He described the spike as “unprecedented”, driven entirely by destination wedding groups and smaller groups of 50-180 whose scheduled flights were cancelled at short notice: “Look for 50-seater airline jets and you will find that nothing is available in the market today because, ultimately, you have to take aircraft away from a scheduled carrier’s flow. ”“Every airline does charters, but none can support this kind of sudden demand, especially at a time their scheduled flights are flying packed because of IndiGo disruptions,” he said.In one instance, he added, an eight-seater aircraft had to be flown empty from Delhi to Kolkata to pick up a wedding party after their airline connection broke down.Mandar Bharde, of Mumbai-based MAB Aviation, said past four days had brought a flood of enquiries, led largely by destination weddings and year-end travel.“Every day we are getting requests from destination wedding hosts in Jaipur and Udaipur. Dec is peak vacation season and all charter flights are full,” he said. Bharde added that Mumbai has about 8-10 charter aircraft while Delhi has about 20, but most operators were already busy before the airline disruptions worsened the crunch.Rahul Muchhal, of Accretion Aviation, said: “We’ve been getting 200-250 calls daily over the past three days, not much from Mumbai, and mostly for Delhi-Goa, Delhi-Udaipur and Mumbai-Delhi. But today, nothing is available. The actual bookings were mainly from corporate houses who needed to shift people urgently.”So, how much do these charters cost? A 30-seater Delhi-Udaipur charter was quoted at about Rs 17.6 lakh plus taxes, touching Rs 20 lakh all-inclusive; the operator did not divulge the aircraft type. Smaller aircraft such as the 7-seater King Air B200 on the Delhi-Vadodara sector cost Rs 11 lakh for a round trip. Aircraft type also dictates the price.A 13-seater Embraer Legacy aircraft cost Rs 20 lakh to charter, including 18% GST, and a 7-seater Bombardier Learjet went for Rs 18-19 lakh.","The scramble has become emblematic of the sudden rush for charter aircraft in india as disruptions at the country’s largest airline ripple through the peak travel and wedding season.

'Like Pole Star': PM Modi Lauds Strong Ties With Russia; Hails Moscow's Support In War On Terror

Relationship built on trust has stood test of time: PM

NEW DELHI: Amidst the turbulence the world has witnessed in the past 8 decades, the India-Russia relationship has remained like the pole or a guiding star resting on mutual respect and trust, said PM Narendra Modi as both sides reaffirmed their commitment to upgrading the economic partnership in the summit with President Vladimir Putin.The 2 countries signed over a dozen agreements and MoUs, including in areas like health, migration and maritime cooperation, and adopted a framework for economic cooperation that is expected to boost trade to $ 100 billion in the next 5 years, as Putin said that Russia is ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy.Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India's energy, said Putin while hailing India’s “independent and self-sufficient"" foreign policy. The Indian side maintained its energy partners, whether old or new, understood the need for diversification given its focus on securing its energy interests and the need to maintain stability in oil prices.While there was a “general discussion” on defence including the Make-in-India initiative and legacy cooperation, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the focus in the summit was mainly on economic cooperation and efforts to ensure balanced and sustainable trade by facilitating more Indian exports to Russia.Both leaders also strongly backed ongoing efforts for early conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. Modi underlined the significance of civil nuclear cooperation, saying energy security has been a strong and vital pillar of the India-Russia partnership.“Over the past eight decades, the world has witnessed many ups and downs. Humanity has faced numerous challenges and crises. Yet, through all of this, the India-Russia friendship has remained steady like a guiding star. Built on mutual respect and deep trust, our relationship has stood the test of time,” said Modi, adding that the new economic cooperation programme till 2030 will make trade and investment more diversified and balanced. He said cooperation in critical minerals is vital for ensuring secure and diversified supply chains across the world.India announced a free 30-day e-Tourist Visa and a 30-day Group Tourist Visa for Russian citizens. The manpower mobility agreement will create new strength and new opportunities for both countries, said Modi, who also raised the need for early release of Indians serving in the Russian army with Putin.According to a joint statement - as both sides called for comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council to reflect contemporary global realities and to make it more representative, effective and efficient in dealing with issues of international peace and security - Russia reiterated its steadfast support for India’s permanent membership in a reformed Council.Putin also said that Russia and India are conducting independent foreign policy together with the like-minded countries in BRICS and SCO and promoting a more “just and democratic multipolar world order”.“We are defending the main principles of the international law enshrined in the UN Charter. Among them, the right of any country for its own way of development and the preservation of their cultural civilizational identity, respect for sovereignty, careful balance of interests of all participants of the world community,” said Putin.On defence cooperation, the joint statement said that responding to India’s quest for self-reliance, the partnership is reorienting presently to joint research and development, co-development and co-production of advanced defence technology and systems. “Our country for the last half a century has been helping to arm and modernize the Indian army, including the air defense forces, aviation, and the navy. In general, we are undoubtedly satisfied with the results of the negotiations we just had,” said Putin in his media statement after the meeting.On international issues, the leaders endorsed their cooperation in keeping Afghanistan free of terrorism and stressed the importance of resolving the Iran nuclear issue through dialogue. They also expressed concern, according to the joint statement, over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and strongly stressed the importance for all parties concerned to remain committed to agreements and understandings reached between them for cessation of conflict, humanitarian assistance and a sustainable peace.","The 2 countries signed over a dozen agreements and mous, including in areas like health, migration and maritime cooperation.

Sheikh Hasina, UK MP Tulip Siddiq Convicted in Corruption Case, Raising Concerns Over Fair Trials

Unreasonable for nations to expect say in our foreign ties: EAM

NEW DELHI: Amid calls by Bangladesh for ex-PM Sheikh Hasina ’s extradition, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said Saturday her stay in India is her personal decision influenced by what transpired in the country last year.India has so far not acceded to Dhaka’s demand for the extradition of Hasina, who was sentenced to death last month for crimes against humanity.Asked if she could stay as long as she wanted, the minister said this was a different question. “She came here in a certain circumstance, and I think that circumstance clearly is a factor in what happens to her. But again, that is something in which she has to make up her mind,” he said. He also said India is a well-wisher of Bangladesh.“As a democratic country... we would like to see the will of the people ascertained. I’m quite confident that whatever comes out... would have a balanced and mature view about the relationship and, hopefully things would improve,” he said at Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.On the visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin , he said the India-Russia partnership has been among the “steadiest big relationships” in the last 70-80 years.Foreign minister Jaishankar disagreed that Putin’s visit could complicate India’s negotiations with the US on a bilateral trade agreement.“I think everybody knows that India has relations with all the major countries in the world,” Jaishankar said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. “I think for any country to expect to have a veto or a say in how we develop our relations with others is not a reasonable proposition,” he said.Jaishankar was asked if Putin’s two-day visit to New Delhi that focused largely on significantly enhancing the economic dimension of India-Russia ties will have a bearing on the negotiations with the US for the proposed trade deal. “Because remember, the others can expect the same. I think we’ve always made it very clear that we have multiple relationships. We have a freedom of choice,” he said. “We talk about what is called strategic autonomy and that continues and I cannot imagine why anybody would have reason to expect the contrary,” he added.The minister acknowledged that the focus of the Trump administration has been on trade and noted that India’s approach in navigating it is totally driven by national interests. “I think clearly right now trade is the most important issue there. We have, it’s clearly very central to the thinking in Washington, much more than it was to earlier administrations, which is something which we have recognised and we are prepared to meet,” he said.“But we are prepared to meet it on reasonable terms. I mean, for those of you who think that diplomacy is about pleasing somebody else I’m sorry, that’s not my view of diplomacy. I mean, to me, it is about defending our national interests,” he said.The India-US relations are going through possibly the worst phase in the last two decades after Washington imposed a whopping 50% on Indian goods, including 25% levies for New Delhi’s procurement of Russian crude. The two sides are currently holding negotiations for the proposed a trade deal “We believe that there can be a landing point for our respective trade interests. Obviously, that is something which will be negotiated hard because it has an implication for livelihoods in this country,” he said.“At the end of the day, for us the interests of the workers and the farmers and the small business and the middle class matters. When we look at a trade agreement with a country like the US, you have to be extremely judicious about your position, about what you put on the table,” he said.On President Putin’s trip to India, Jaishankar said for a “big” and “rising” country like India, it is important to maintain good cooperation with as many important players as possible in the world in line with freedom of choice.",External affairs minister s jaishankar said sheikh hasina's stay in india is her personal decision influenced by what transpired in the country last year.

"Govt caps flight fares, gives IndiGo 2 days to normalise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise/articleshow/125812074.cms,"Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

Cap on fares comes too late for lakhs

NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees and taxes extra). In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed.

'Maligning Hindu Way Of Life': PM Modi Calls Out Colonial Mindset Over 'Hindu Rate Of Growth' Label

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Saturday said India was witnessing a “psychological renaissance” as it shook off the slavery mindset, which was reflected in its slow pace of development being termed as Hindu rate of growth, and asserted that the country was now the growth-driver of the global economy.The PM said India was being showered with plaudits like “global powerhouse” or “global growth engine” when it was the fastest growing major economy. But when it gr-ew at a rate between 2% and 3%, the term “Hindu rate of growth” was coined to describe its slow pace, he said.“Do you think the act of linking a country’s economic growth to the faith of its people and their identity was without any reason? No, it was reflective of the mindset of slavery,” he said at the HT Leadership Summit, adding no one was using the term when India clocked a high rate of gro-wth. GDP grew at a robust 8.2% in the second quarter.The so-called intellectuals saw no communalism in a phrase like “Hindu rate of growth” that made Hindu civilisation and culture synonymous with poverty and unproductivity, he said.The British mocked Indian tradition to strip people of self-confidence, Modi said, adding that his govt was working to restore the country’s prominence in a host of sectors. Modi said India was now in a different league at a time when the world was talking of a slowdown. India was scripting the chapter of growth and has become a pillar of trust amid “crisis of trust” in the world, he added. “India’s journey today is not merely about development. It is also about a change of mindset. It is also a journey of psychological renaissance,” the PM said.","Pm narendra modi said india was witnessing a ‘psychological renaissance’ as it shook off the slavery mindset.

Red Fort Blast Had A Bigger Plan: Faridabad Doctor’s January 26 Recces Raise Chilling Questions

Slap UN sanctions on LeT, JeM: India, US

NEW DELHI: Even as uncertainty looms over the Quad summit, the grouping held a meeting of its counterterrorism working group and unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.In a joint statement, the members also expressed their condolences for the “heinous terror incident” near Red Fort in Delhi last month, called for the perpetrators, organisers and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice, and urged all UN member states to cooperate in doing so.With India and the US yet to finalise a bilateral trade agreement that is crucial for their relationship, the Quad summit could not take place this year, and there’s no formal word on when India might be able to host it in 2026. However, Quad has remained engaged at the level of officials on issues of interest in the Indo-Pacific. In Sept, Indiahosted counterterrorismworkshops that included a technical exchange on misuse of Unmanned Aerial Systems/drones by terrorists and a seminar on preventing terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technologies, including for terror-financing.During the meeting last week, the Quad member countries exchanged assessments on the terrorism threat landscape, including developments in the Indo-Pacific region.“They discussed the full spectrum of counterterrorism cooperation and measures that could be used to address existing and emerging challenges. They underscored the importance of ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains open and free from the threats of terrorism,” said the joint statement.A Tabletop Exercise (TTx) on “Counter Terrorism Operations in the Urban Environment” was also conducted. The TTx provided CT experts an opportunity to share their best practices and identify potential opportunities for joint operational preparedness to respond to complex terrorist scenarios, said the statement.“The Quad partners reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen cooperation in multilateral fora. They also emphasised the value of continued information sharing on terrorists, terrorist organisations and their proxies,” it said.India and the US have called for additional designation of IS and al-Qaida affiliates, and LeT and JeM and their proxy groups, supporters, sponsors, financiers and backers under UN 1267 sanctions regime, ensuring they face a global asset freeze. The two renewed their commitment to strengthen multilateral cooperation in countering terrorism including in UN, Quad, FATF.","Quad condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism.

After S-400 Gamechanger, Putin & Modi Set For S-500 Monster Missile Pact | Full Detail

Tough to give India S-500 systems as of now, says official

NEW DELHI: India and Russia on Thursday agreed to further enhance their expansive defence partnership, including through collaboration in niche military technologies and stronger defence-industrial cooperation, which is likely to see Moscow continuing as New Delhi’s leading arms supplier for the foreseeable future, reports Rajat Pandit.Ahead of the Modi-Putin summit, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrei Belousov stressed ties were based on “a deep sense of trust, common principles and mutual respect” while inking a protocol on “ongoing and prospective areas” of defence cooperation.The 22nd inter-governmental commission on military and military-technical cooperation, co-chaired by the ministers, underlined India’s intent to retain its strategic autonomy despite mounting pressure from the US and EU to distance itself from Russia.Sources said discussions ranged from India acquiring additional S-400 Triumf air defence systems and their surface-to-air missiles in large numbers to upgrading IAF’s Sukhoi-30MKI fighter fleet and arming them with long-range R-37 and RVV-BD air-to-air missiles.The joint production of advanced variants of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as procurement of short-range Pantsir and man-portable Verba air defence systems also figured in the talks.“It will be difficult for Russia to supply advanced S-500 air defence systems as of now even if India wants them. Its fifth-generation Sukhoi-57 fighters are also on offer, but India is yet to take a decision,” an official said.Taking note during the meeting of the special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia, Rajnath Singh said India is determined to expand the capacity of its indigenous defence industry for both local production and exports under the aegis of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ policy.Belousov, in turn, said Russian defence industry was ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in defence production, highlighting that both the countries were “united by many years of friendship and strategic cooperation”.India also wants Russia to expedite deliveries of critical military hardware that have been hugely delayed due to the Ukraine war. These include the two remaining squadrons of the five S-400 squadrons contracted for $5.43 billion in 2018 as well as the advanced Akula-class nuclear attack submarine, which was supposed to arrive this year on a 10-year lease under the $3 billion deal signed in March 2019. “Russia says the two S-400 squadrons will be delivered next year, while the submarine will come in 2028,” a source said.India plans to acquire another five S-400 squadrons, while defence ministry has also cleared the Rs 10,000 crore procurement of 280 of its missiles with interception ranges of 120km, 200km, 250km and 380km to replenish stocks used during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities with Pakistan as well as build reserves, as was earlier reported by TOI.IAF also wants R-37 air-to-air missiles, with a range of over 200km, and its advanced version called RVV-BD to arm its upgraded Sukhoi-30MKI fighters. This will counter Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 long-range missiles that initially caught it off-guard during Operation Sindoor.Advanced lighter versions of BrahMos missiles, whose strike range has already been enhanced to 450km from the initial 290km and will eventually go up to 800km, are also on the cards.While the heavyweight Sukhoi fighters armed with BrahMos missiles had carried out long-range precision strikes against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the plan now is to go for smaller air-launched BrahMos-NG missiles that can be carried by lightweight jets as well.The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles with a 2.8-Mach speed becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.","India and russia agree to further enhance their expansive defence partnership.

IndiGo says more cancellation in next few days

NEW DELHI: The Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise after IndiGo reported widespread operational disruptions and an unusually high number of flight cancellations across its network since late November 2025.Civil Aviation Minister reviewed the situation with senior MoCA officials and IndiGo’s top management, directing the airline and all relevant aviation bodies to take urgent steps to assist passengers and stabilise operations. The Ministry said it is keeping a “close watch” on the situation, according to DGCA's statement cited by ANI.""In addition, the Civil Aviation Minister has also held a meeting with senior officers of the Airport Authority of India and instructed AAI to inform all airport directors that they should constantly monitor the situation and provide all support to stranded passengers. He also directed DGCA to closely monitor the airfares during the flight disruptions/cancellations,"" according to the released statement.Apart from the ministry, DGCA, in a detailed review meeting chaired by the Director General (Civil Aviation), flagged concerns over IndiGo cancelling 170–200 flights per day, a level significantly higher than normal for the country’s largest airline.IndiGo attributed the disruptions to transitional challenges from the implementation of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) Civil Aviation Requirements, which came into effect in two phases — 01 July 2025 and 01 November 2025 — following court directions.The airline said the new fatigue-management rules, crew-planning issues, and winter operational constraints have sharply impacted scheduling stability.DGCA has directed IndiGo to normalise operations at the earliest and ensure that the current situation does not lead to fare increases.IndiGo has been instructed to submit:As DGCA released its statement assuring firm corrective action and close monitoring, IndiGo, however, informed the regulator that stabilising its network will require a short transition period. The airline told DGCA that additional cancellations will continue over the next two to three days as part of its schedule-reset effort aimed at restoring roster balance and preventing further last-minute disruptions, as reported by PTI.IndiGo has also conveyed that it will proactively scale down flight operations starting December 8 to minimise passenger inconvenience and allow crew-planning teams to rebuild buffers eroded over recent weeks. According to the airline, this controlled reduction in operations is essential to streamline rosters, align crew availability with revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) norms and ensure that fatigue-management standards are fully complied with.The carrier has assured DGCA that corrective measures are already underway and that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026. IndiGo said its recovery plan includes accelerated crew recruitment, intensified training cycles and a phased reintroduction of flights once adequate staffing and roster resilience are secured.",The civil aviation ministry and the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) have launched an intensive review and monitoring exercise.

Influencer Alix Earle splits with NFL’s Braxton Berrios as fans question what triggered the sudden end



Alix Earle has left her partner on the dance floor, marking the end of a relationship that once seemed to thrive even under relentless public attention. Multiple outlets report that the Hot Mess podcast host has parted ways with Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios, a year after they confirmed their romance in October 2023. The news arrives after weeks of speculation, silence and scattered hints that something had shifted between them.The breakup follows a season of questions during her time on Dancing With the Stars, where viewers noticed Braxton’s absence from the live shows. Alix shut down early rumors in November when a fan commented, “Ugh I hope u and Braxton are still together,” and she responded, “He couldn’t come bc of football.” His support came through a video aired during the November 25 finale, where he said, “I've watched you pour everything into this since the moment it has started, and I think it shows. Good luck. Have fun, babe.”The couple often opened up about the strain of long distance, and Alix shared how much she leaned on him during the competition. “I had a breakdown to Braxton the other night,” she told E! News. “I was like, ‘Braxton, I don't think I can be sexy.I don't know what to do. I need you to help me.’” She added, “He’s so supportive. I FaceTime him every day and every chance I get. He’s always supportive and I’m there to support him too. ”But finishing second on the show brought new distance. She stayed in Los Angeles instead of joining him for games, while he focused on the Texans’ season. Reports later suggested the two struggled to navigate their schedules. One source told US Weekly the “majority of their relationship was long-distance and it was hard for them to navigate.”Another insider told the Daily Mail that Alix “has not been happy with the direction their relationship is going in,” adding that they even spent Thanksgiving apart. Though they shared a warm moment in October when she surprised him with a birthday celebration, time and distance eventually caught up with them.Their split comes just weeks after celebrating their two year anniversary, closing a chapter shaped by effort, affection and the challenges of living in two different worlds.Also Read: Molly Qerim flaunts effortless tank top fashion on sunny getaway, fueling speculation after ‘First Take’ departure",Alix earle and braxton berrios have split after two years together.

Tammy Wilson calls out Trevone Boykin and clears up the Thanksgiving timeline

Russell Wilson’s rough Giants year, his family legacy, and why this clapback landed

Russell Wilson is having one of the toughest seasons of his career with the New York Giants, and somehow his Thanksgiving guest list ended up on the internet too. Former teammate Trevone Boykin recently went on a podcast and called a holiday dinner at Wilson’s house “weird” because the quarterback’s family was not there, which quickly turned into another round of think-pieces about Wilson’s personality and home life.This time, Wilson did not have to say anything. His mother, Tammy Wilson, logged on instead. In a string of viral comments on social media, she shut down Boykin’s version of events, defended her son, and reminded everyone that the Wilson family is not hurting for money or history.Boykin’s story has been making the rounds since late November. On his podcast appearance, he described a Thanksgiving at Wilson and Ciara’s home as the “weirdest feeling,” said the dinner was catered, and highlighted that none of Wilson’s family was there. He added that if he had Wilson’s money and airline connections, he would have flown everyone in.Once the clip hit social media, a familiar script followed. People questioned whether Wilson was close to his family and used a nine-year-old holiday to paint a picture of him as distant or out of touch.Tammy Wilson stepped into the comments and made it clear she was done watching strangers and former teammates dissect her son. In a comment captured by outlets like The Shade Room and others, she wrote:“I am his mom. It is none of your business. This is opportunistic I am so tired of you men cutting down my son.Jesus said, to all accusing the woman, ‘he who is without sin cast the 1st stone.’ Part of our family was in Fla at a tournament. I stayed planned to stay home bc I wanted to fast the 4 days before year end. Russ thought enough of you, who has a criminal history, to love you enough to invite you over. This why Russ keeps it moving. Folks not trustworthy. Russ though will forgive, but not again. I hope you felt relevant for a few minutes. Lord forgive him for he know not what he is doing.”Then she went back and added one more line that turned into a meme on its own: “and we got our own money.”Separate reporting has also clarified what Boykin left out. The Thanksgiving he was talking about was not from this season. The dinner was from 2016, when the Wilson family was in Florida supporting Anna Wilson and Stanford women’s basketball at a holiday tournament. Tammy’s explanation matches that timeline and helps explain why much of the family was not at the house that night.Boykin has his own off-field history, including past domestic assault allegations that ended his time with the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle released him in 2018.Tammy did not spell that out in a press conference. She did it in a comment box, directly under a post about her son, and made it clear that inviting him into their home was an act of grace that will not be repeated.All of this is happening while Russell Wilson is already under a microscope on the field. The Giants are 2-11 heading into their Week 14 bye, and Wilson has slid down the depth chart to QB3 behind starter Jaxson Dart and backup Jameis Winston. His future as a starting quarterback is already in question, and he has even dipped his toe into broadcasting with a guest spot on “The NFL Today” earlier this season.Off the field, he is in a different kind of headline. Wilson and Ciara just listed their Rancho Santa Fe estate in California for $54.9 million, a price that could set a residential record in San Diego County if they get anywhere near the ask. The couple bought the nine-acre property for $14.5 million in 2021 and turned it into “Amor Estate,” a 30,000-square-foot Mediterranean compound with a private football field, recording studio, full gym, and a long list of luxury amenities.That is the backdrop for Tammy’s final flex about having their “own money.” It is not a random brag. It ties back to a family that has stacked degrees, leadership roles, and real estate for decades. Her late husband, Harrison Wilson III, built his own path in law and sports. Russell’s grandfather, Dr. Harrison B. Wilson Jr., spent 22 years as president of Norfolk State University.So when Boykin implies that the absence of extended relatives at one catered Thanksgiving says something about Russell’s character or his relationship with his family, Tammy is not just defending a quarterback. She is defending a legacy and pushing back on a narrative that has followed her son for most of his career, where every story about him being “different” or “corny” becomes an easy punchline.The public reaction shows why her post hit so hard. Fans on social media quickly shifted from dissecting Wilson’s dinner menu to praising his mother for speaking plainly, quoting her lines back to each other, and calling out Boykin for talking about a private invite years after the fact.There is no scheme or film breakdown here. It is simple. Wilson opened his doors, Boykin went public with his opinion about the vibe, and Tammy Wilson decided that would be the last time someone tried to get clicks by dragging her son’s name into a holiday story.If there is a takeaway from this week, it is that Russell Wilson might be QB3 in New York right now, but his mother is still first-team when it comes to pass protection online.","Trevone boykin said a thanksgiving dinner at russell wilson's house was 'weird' because his family was not there.

Khamzat Chimaev, Pavel Durov and what comes next for ‘Borz’

Khamzat Chimaev posted on X this week asking Telegram founder Pavel Durov to be in his corner for his next fight. The message came while Chimaev is off the fight list for a foot surgery and a planned recovery that will stretch into and after Ramadan 2026.Khamzat Chimaev said he wants a big name with him when he steps back into the Octagon. The post read in part, “Brother @durov in my corner next …” and the invite quickly made headlines across MMA sites and social feeds. Promoters and media now watch to see if Durov, the billionaire Telegram CEO will accept.Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot, sources say. He told reporters he will pause full training until after Ramadan.That timing means he likely will not fight until late March or April 2026, depending on recovery. While he heals, Chimaev has named Nassourdine Imavov as a possible next challenger and has also answered calls for a superfight with Alex Pereira.Chimaev’s public invite to Pavel Durov adds a new twist. Durov is a tech billionaire (listed at about $17.1 billion by some outlets) and he has recently worked with former fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov on Telegram projects.Khabib sold digital papakha collectibles on Telegram and helped raise roughly $4–4.5 million in November 2025, showing how the platform can link fighters and rich backers. That history makes Durov a logical target for Chimaev’s request.There is also history between Chimaev and Team Khabib. The two sides had a near-brawl after UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi in October 2022 when Chimaev pushed Abubakar Nurmagomedov.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Khabib later helped calm things down. Recently, Chimaev posted a message praising Islam Makhachev and showing he wants peace with the Dagestani group.That all makes a Durov cornering moment possible, since Khabib and Durov have worked together before.Chimaev’s X post and the reports appeared in late November to early December 2025.His surgery and plan to resume full training after Ramadan were reported during the same period by MMA outlets covering UFC offseason news.If recovery goes well, Khamzat Chimaev’s comeback fight could happen in spring or early summer 2026.Also Read: Joe Rogan Claims Jesus May Come Back As Artificial Intelligence And Sends Social Media Into Debate","Khamzat chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot.

Shilo Sanders’ NIL earnings and legal issues under review





Shilo Sanders’ NFL career and bankruptcy case raise questions about NIL earnings





Shilo Sanders, the NFL free agent and son of legendary coach Deion Sanders, is at the center of a growing financial and legal storm. The former Colorado safety, who recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is now accused of making unauthorized transfers totaling $250,000. The controversy revolves around money earned from his college football name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, raising questions about compliance with bankruptcy law.The dispute has attracted significant media attention, as Shilo Sanders’ attorney strongly challenges the claims. Keri Riley, representing Sanders, insists the allegations are fundamentally flawed and argues that the funds in question were legitimately earned after the bankruptcy filing. According to Riley, the earnings, processed through companies created by Sanders, Big 21 LLC and Headache Gang LLC, should not be considered part of the bankruptcy estate.The trustee handling Sanders’ bankruptcy case claims the NFL player improperly transferred funds post-petition, potentially violating federal bankruptcy rules. These transfers, linked to Sanders’ NIL income during and after college, are now under legal review.Riley maintains that the money was generated legitimately and was separate from any pre-bankruptcy liabilities, emphasizing that Sanders’ NIL agreements are a modern revenue source increasingly used by college athletes.Adding complexity, Sanders faces a longstanding financial obligation stemming from a 2015 lawsuit. A former high school security guard in Dallas alleged Sanders caused injuries during an incident, and a default judgment of nearly $12 million was awarded. While Sanders filed for bankruptcy to manage this liability, the current allegations over NIL transfers complicate his path to financial resolution.Despite off-field challenges, Sanders briefly joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. Reports indicate he signed a three-year contract worth roughly $2.97 million, although he earned just $1,572 in guaranteed money after being released during the preseason. His professional prospects now remain uncertain, with both legal and career questions looming.As this case unfolds, it highlights the intersection of bankruptcy law and modern NIL earnings, an emerging issue for athletes navigating financial and legal obligations. With Sanders’ attorney disputing the trustee’s claims, the outcome could set an important precedent for how post-bankruptcy NIL income is treated in the future.Also Read: “Never seen a call like that”: Dak Prescott slams referees after controversial penalty in Lions’ 44-30 win over Cowboys","Nfl free agent shilo sanders faces $250k nil transfer dispute amid bankruptcy case.
