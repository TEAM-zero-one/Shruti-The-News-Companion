Kash Patel to be fired for Charlie Kirk probe blunders?

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Kash patel, the fbi director, made a series of wrong moves in the charlie kirk incident.

Daylight Saving Time: Change ends sooner than usual; when will the clocks fall back?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daylight-saving-time-change-ends-sooner-than-usual-when-will-the-clocks-fall-back/articleshow/123863573.cms,".





Daylight saving time (DST) will end sooner than usual this year on Sunday, November 2, 2025, at 2:00 am local time.With it, Americans will have an extra hour of sleep, and also earlier sunsets in many regions. This year’s change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift since daylight saving time falls on the first Saturday in November, the earliest possible date is November 1.Experts often remind people to use the extra hour to reset sleep schedules, check smoke detector batteries, and prepare for the shorter days ahead, making the shift a small but useful reminder to prioritize health and safety.Daylight saving time, observed from March to November, was introduced to make better use of daylight. In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates. The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe DST to maintain consistent time across its territory. Five US territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, also do not follow DST.For many Americans, shifting the clocks requires changes to daily routines. Longer daylight in spring is generally seen as a benefit, while the fall shift brings darker mornings and earlier sunsets, disrupting commutes, outdoor plans, and schedules.","Daylight saving time (dst) will end on sunday, november 2, 2025, at 2:00 am local time.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh called on the armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare and remain prepared for ""invisible challenges"" such as information, ideological, ecological, and biological warfare.His remarks came at the Combined Commanders’ Conference 2025 in Kolkata on September 16, according to a Ministry of Defence press release.Emphasising the rapidly shifting global order, regional instability, and emerging security threats, Singh said constant reassessment of the world’s changes was critical for India’s security. He underlined that the “nature of warfare is continuously evolving,” with recent global conflicts highlighting the need for a “technology-friendly” military.“Wars of today are so sudden and unpredictable that it is extremely difficult to foretell its duration. It can be two months, a year, or even five years. We need to be prepared. We need to ensure that our surge capacity remains sufficient,” the Defence minister said, according to news agency ANI.Terming India’s defence posture an amalgamation of offensive and defensive capabilities, Singh urged commanders to proactively shape strategies and “strive to build the Sudarshan Chakra as envisioned by PM Modi.”A committee has been formed to examine the project and prepare a “realistic action plan,” he said, suggesting a five-year medium-term plan and a ten-year long-term plan to make the vision a reality.He also called for adopting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of “JAI (Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation)” to drive modernisation, operational readiness, technological superiority, and credible deterrence.Stressing the importance of partnerships, Singh batted for deeper engagement with industry and academia to develop future-ready technologies. He reaffirmed PM Modi’s vision to expand the private sector’s role in building a robust defence innovation ecosystem and making India’s domestic industry “the biggest & best in the world.”Equally vital, he said, was synergy among the Armed Forces and civil agencies. Calling jointness “essential” to confront future challenges, Singh pointed to initiatives such as the creation of Tri-Service Logistics Nodes and a Tri-Service Logistic Management Application to enhance integration.Highlighting India’s growing self-reliance, Singh said: “Operation Sindoor has demonstrated that Strength, Strategy and Self-reliance are the three pillars that will give India the power it needs in the 21st century. Today, we have the capability to face any challenge with the help of indigenous platforms and systems coupled with the indomitable courage of our soldiers. This is the real strength of Aatmanirbhar Bharat .”Reiterating that self-reliance is “not a slogan, but a necessity,” Singh argued that defence indigenisation under Aatmanirbhar Bharat is fueling economic growth, generating jobs, and boosting capacities of shipyards, aerospace clusters, and defence corridors.He announced his approval of the Defence Procurement Manual 2025 to streamline acquisitions, while noting that the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 is also being revised to “simplify the processes, reduce delays, and provide operational strength to the forces quickly.”The conference was attended by Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, DRDO Chairman Dr Samir V Kamat, and other senior officials.",Defence minister rajnath singh called on the armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare.

We need to ensure that our surge capacity remains sufficient,"" he said.The defence minister also said that a committee has been set up to prepare ""a realistic action plan"" to build an air and missile defence shield under 'Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)'.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the MSC on Aug 15, declaring that comprehensive security cover would be provided under it to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.India will from next year onwards begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO under Project Kusha, which will be one of the key elements of MSC. The M1 (150-km interception range), M2 (250-km) and M3 (350-km) missiles as well as associated systems are expected to be ready for induction by 2030, as was first reported by TOI.Singh, on his part, called upon the commanders to be ""proactive in their approach"" and strive to build the Sudarshan Chakra. ""Devise a medium-term plan for the next five years and a long-term plan for the next 10 years to bring the PM's vision to fruition,"" he said.","The armed forces should go beyond the traditional concepts of war, says rajnath singh. A committee has been set up to prepare ""a realistic action plan"" to build an air and missile defence shield under 'mission sudarshan chakra' prime minister narendra modi had announced the msc on aug 15.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123932700,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22086,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
India rejected 3rd-party role to end conflict: Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-rejected-3rd-party-role-to-end-conflict-pakistan/articleshow/123932677.cms,"Pakistan's deputy PM and foreign minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar has revealed that India categorically refused any third-party mediation in resolving bilateral issues with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor , contrary to claims made by US President Donald Trump.During an interview with Al Jazeera, Dar stated that Islamabad had raised the issue of third-party mediation with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, to which the US official responded that India did not support any outside involvement.Dar recounted a specific interaction with Rubio regarding Trump's claims of mediating the May 10 ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed nations. ""Incidentally, when the ceasefire offer came through Rubio to me on May 10... I was told that there would be a dialogue between Pakistan and India at an independent place... When we met on July 25 during a bilateral meeting with Rubio in Washington, I asked him 'What happened to those dialogues?' He said, 'India says that it is a bilateral issue,'"" Dar said.Dar's remarks contradict Trump's repeated assertions that the US brokered the ceasefire between the two neighbours amid heightened tensions during Operation Sindoor - India's precision military strikes on nine terrorist infrastructures in Pakistan and PoK - which came in retaliation to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 26 people.Since May, Trump has been claiming that his administration's mediation averted a potential ""nuclear war"". India has categorically denied that there was any third-party intervention, stating that the ceasefire was achieved through direct talks between Directors General of Military Operations of the two nations.The Pakistani foreign minister also stressed Islamabad's willingness to engage in talks, but added that Pakistan refused to ""beg"" for an engagement with India. ""It takes two to tango,"" he said.""We don't mind, but India has categorically been stating it's bilateral. We don't mind bilateral. However, the dialogue must be comprehensive, encompassing terrorism, trade, economy, and Jammu & Kashmir,"" he said.""So, unless India wishes to have dialogue, we can't force dialogue. We don't wish to force dialogue,"" Dar added.He stressed that Pakistan remained committed to eliminating terrorism from its soil and had made the highest sacrifices in this fight.On water issues, Dar cautioned that future wars would be fought over water and reminded that under Indus Waters Treaty, India could not unilaterally suspend or revoke water distribution. ""Pakistan has made it clear that any attempt to stop water will be considered a declaration of war."" When asked about Pakistan's nuclear capability, Dar said its nuclear force is purely defensive, has never been used, and there is no intent to use it; but if Pakistan's sovereignty is attacked, it will defend itself at all costs.The Express Tribune reported Dar also described the recent Israeli strike on Qatar as a grave action against international law, the UN Charter, and sovereignty of Muslim countries. ""You have seen Lebanon, Syria, Iran and now Qatar attacked. This approach is unacceptable,"" he said, adding that the attack was intended to sabotage that process.",Pakistan's deputy pm and foreign minister mohammad ishaq dar has revealed that india categorically refused any third-party mediation in resolving bilateral issues with pakistan during operation sindoor.

'Parliament's decision upheld': Centre reacts to SC's Waqf order; Opposition says 'government conspiracy stopped',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliaments-decision-upheld-centre-reacts-to-scs-waqf-order-opposition-says-government-conspiracy-stopped/articleshow/123895452.cms,"



'Law made in Parliament can't be rejected'



Poll Do you agree with the Supreme Court's decision to stay key provisions of the Waqf Amendment Act 2025? Yes, it protects citizens' rights No, it undermines parliamentary decisions

'Govt's conspiracy stopped'



What was SC's order?



NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju interpreted the Supreme Court's order on Waqf Amendment Act 2025 in Centre's favour, saying that the apex court ""upheld the decision made in the Parliament."" SC stalled key provisions of the act, including the clause that only practising Muslim of five years can dedicate a property as Waqf.Meanwhile, Congress viewed the judgement from an opposite lens saying that the order put a ""complete stop to government's conspiracy"", welcoming it as a relief for hose who feared their lands will be grabbed.Welcoming the judgement, Kiren Rijiju called it a win for ""democracy"" noting that ""when any law is made in the Parliament, it cannot be rejected.""""I welcome the order passed by the Supreme Court today after a full hearing on the Waqf Amendment Act. The Supreme Court knows the entire subject,"" Rijiju said.""I believe that whatever the Supreme Court bench has decided is a very good sign for our democracy, because when any law is made in the Parliament, it cannot be reject and this is what the Supreme Court has approved today... I am satisfied with the judgment of the Supreme Court, and because it is the highest court of the country, whenever any decision comes from the Supreme Court, it has an impact, and in a way, the decision of the Parliament of India has been upheld.We will see the case of a practising Muslim and what should be included in the rules,"" he added.Viewing the judgement as against the central government's ""attempt to grab land"", Congress MP Imran Pratapgarhi pointed to SC's take on ""practising Muslim for five years"" clause and welcomed the stay on the provision.""This is a really good decision. The Supreme Court has put a complete stop to the conspiracy and intentions of the government. People who donate their land were fearful that the government would attempt to grab their land. This is a relief to them. How will the government decide who has been a practising Muslim for five years? This is a matter of faith. The court took note of all these aspects. We will continue the fight,"" he said.Expressing similar sentiments, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""The Supreme Court’s order today on the Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 represents a substantial victory not just for the parties that opposed this arbitrary law in Parliament but all those members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee who submitted detailed dissent notes which were then ignored but now stand vindicated.""""The Order is an important one because it goes a long way towards undoing the mischievous intentions underlying the original statute. Counsels for the opposition parties had argued that the law would result in the creation of a structure where anyone and everyone could challenge the status of the property before the Collector, and the status of the property would be in limbo while in such litigation. Additionally, only a ‘Muslim’ practising for 5 years could donate to a Waqf. The intention behind these sections was always apparent - to keep the voter base inflamed and create an administrative structure to indulge those seeking to foment religious disputes,"" he added.Among the key provisions stayed was the clause requiring a person to be a practising Muslim for five years before dedicating property as Waqf, with the court noting the absence of any rules to fairly determine such status.The bench also pressed pause on provisions vesting wide powers in government collectors to decide whether a property qualifies as Waqf, warning that such authority would amount to the executive determining citizens’ rights, in violation of the principle of separation of powers.The order further limited the role of non-Muslim members in Waqf institutions, directing that the Central Waqf Council should not have more than four non-Muslims out of 20 members, and State Waqf Boards not more than three out of 11.While refusing to stay provisions on the registration of Waqfs or appointment of board CEOs, the bench observed that, as far as possible, efforts should be made to appoint CEOs from the Muslim community. The court clarified that its directions were interim in nature, issued to safeguard rights until the law’s constitutional validity is examined in full at the final hearing.","Parliamentary affairs minister kiren rijiju welcomes the supreme court's order on waqf amendment act 2025 in centre's favour.

Alix Earle, already a TikTok sensation, had built an enormous following through her candid videos and unfiltered storytelling. Together, they’ve become one of the most-watched young couples, merging the worlds of sports and social media into a story fans can’t get enough of.Berrios admitted early on that dating a high-profile influencer came with new challenges. “Obviously when I met her and we started talking and then dating, I knew that [her being an influencer] came with it,” he shared on SiriusXM Sports. But he also drew a surprising parallel between their careers, pointing out the similarities in work ethic. “We as athletes, we dream of this and do so many things our whole life to get to where we are. And I think there’s a wrong connotation about a lot of the creators or social media stars, because … they do the same thing. Maybe it didn’t take as much time, maybe it didn’t take as many years. But it still takes thought, it takes planning, it takes sacrifice.”Fans first spotted the couple together in 2023, when a TikTok video of them meeting a fan in Miami went viral.Their red carpet debut came at the ESPY Awards that same year, cementing their status as one of sports and entertainment’s rising power couples. By April 2025, the relationship reached another milestone when Alix moved into Berrios’ Miami home.Their romance stirred headlines after Berrios’s ex, model Sophia Culpo, accused him of cheating around the time he began seeing Earle. Despite the noise, the couple continued to grow stronger, even moving in together in Miami in April 2025. Both the Miami Dolphins star and the TikTok personality have insisted that their relationship did not begin while Braxton was still with Sophia.Born and raised in New Jersey, Alix carved her own path after graduating with a marketing degree from the University of Miami in 2023. Her career took off when she started posting “get ready with me” videos, sharing not just her makeup routines but also personal struggles, including acne and anxiety. That honesty resonated with millions, helping her grow to 7.5 million TikTok followers and 4.5 million on Instagram.She later launched her podcast, Hot Mess with Alix Earle, which briefly topped Spotify’s charts, even surpassing The Joe Rogan Experience. In 2025, she was named to the Time100 Creators list, solidifying her influence. Now, she’s preparing to take on a new challenge—competing on season 34 of Dancing With The Stars.From TikTok star to mainstream personality, Alix Earle has built a career on authenticity.

Tyler Robinson in court today: What to expect







The FBI announced a $100,000 reward for any information in connection with the person who shot Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University -- before the arrest of Tyler Robinson. While the manhunt was on, several private individuals, including Trump advisor Alex Bruesewitz, conservative activist Robby Starbuck and billionaire Bill Ackman, offered to increase the amount.But it was Tyler's father, Matthew Robinson or Matt Robinson who turned him in after he identified his son from the videos and photos that the FBI released. Tyler threatened his father that he would end his life rather than getting arrested but his father convinced him and they got in touch with the law enforcement, making Tyler's arrest possible.In custody, Tyler has not yet confessed to the crime and will make his first court appearance today.But questions are being raised as to what will happen to the reward money. Tyler's father is officially eligible to get the money as FBI guidelines allow rewards for tips from family members if the information directly aids the investigation.But claims are floating on social media that he refused to take the money and offered to donate it to Charlie Kirk's Foundation. However, there is no confirmation of the same and it is not yet confirmed whether he got the money or not.Matt Robinson received praise for his brave act to hand his son over to the law enforcement at a time when he could face the death penalty for killing Charlie Kirk. Matt is a registered Republican and a Trump supporter. The family cooperated with the investigation and told cops that Tyler had become more political in recent years and hated Kirk.Utah Governor Spencer Cox earlier said that Tobinson would be formally charged today. ""There will be much more information that is released in the charging documents as they're bringing that together. I'd just like to remind people that press conference on Friday, we had been up all night trying to get as much as we could in a very short amount of time. We're collecting much more, including forensic evidence that is coming back from Quantico that will help us tie the shooter to the weapon and everything else. That is all being processed right now, and there will be much more information on Tuesday when that document is filed with the courts,"" Cox said.","Tyler robinson's father turned him in after he identified his son from the videos and photos that the fbi released.
