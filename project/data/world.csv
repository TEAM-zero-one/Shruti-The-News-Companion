Trump’s announcement said PM Modi agreed to “stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela.” Congress asked whether the government has formally accepted this condition. Buy American commitments: It also said according to the announcement, India would purchase over USD 500 billion of American goods, including energy, technology and agricultural products – raising questions in New Delhi about how this squares with the “Make in India” initiative.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday urged the Centre to “take the Parliament and the entire country into confidence” over details of the India-US trade agreement after US President Donald Trump publicly announced and outlined its key components. Adding Indians have the right to know the full terms of the pact.In a post on X, Congress laid out several concerns, including claims that the deal was announced by Trump “on Modi’s request” and raised questions about its impact on Indian industry, traders and farmers.The grand old party flagging some issues fired four questions at the government demanding a complete clarity and details over the deal:In his post announcing the deal, Trump wrote: “It was an Honor to speak with Prime Minister Modi… He agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela… effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India… whereby the United States will charge a reduced Reciprocal Tariff, lowering it from 25% to 18%… They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO. ”Responding to Trump’s announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the US President, saying he was “delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%” and that stronger cooperation between the two democracies would benefit their people.Congress leaders have also questioned why key aspects of the trade deal were publicly disclosed from Washington, rather than jointly announced by both governments, and called for full disclosure of the agreement’s terms to lawmakers and the public.The government has not yet issued a comprehensive official statement detailing the full terms of the agreement beyond what was shared by Trump and acknowledged by PM Modi.","Congress leaders have also questioned why key aspects of the trade deal were publicly disclosed from washington, rather than jointly announced by both governments.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on feb 1 at london heathrow during engine start of b787 (vt-anx) air india flight ai-132 to bengaluru. Fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off” the safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127870959,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-93692,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Trump Announces India-US Trade Deal, Reduces Reciprocal Tariffs On Delhi To 18%; PM Modi Reacts

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh on Monday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump announced an ""immediate"" India-US trade deal from Washington, adding New Delhi would move to cut tariffs and non-tariff barriers on American goods while the US reduces reciprocal tariffs on India.In a post on X, Ramesh alleged that key announcements impacting India, including the halt of Operation Sindoor, updates on India’s crude purchases from Russia and Venezuela, and now the trade deal itself, were being made from the US capital.""He announced the halt of Op Sindoor from Washington DC. He announced the updates on India’s oil purchases from Russia and Venezuela from Washington.

He also said the US would lower reciprocal tariffs from 25% to 18% and that India would move to reduce its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the US to “zero”.Later, PM Modi thanked Trump for the tariff announcement.

'India Showed...': Ex-Army Chief Naravane's Remarks On Galwan Clash Resurface After Lok Sabha Row

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane has shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Senior military officials, particularly those dealing with classified information, are subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act that restrict the publication of books or information even after retirement to prevent such classified material from becoming public.While a general one-year “cooling-off” period exists for taking up commercial or private employment, regulations for publishing secret content require prior govt clearance.""Four Stars of Destiny"", a memoir of Naravane, who was Army chief from Dec 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, remains unpublished due to pending clearance from the defence ministry regarding sensitive details on the 2020 LAC standoff and Agnipath scheme.The book was slated to hit the stands in Jan 2024, but the Army and the defence ministry asked the publisher not to go ahead until they had reviewed its contents.There has been no official word from the publisher, author, or even the ministry on the status of the book.If the said rules and regulations are violated, govt can take legal action and such violations can also lead to the withholding of part or all of the pension of the military official concerned, as per CCS (Pension) Rules. There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas. As of today, the situation along LAC is characterised by a “thaw” following a series of disengagement agreements, yet high-level military forward deployment from both sides persists.",Rahul gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former army general manoj mukund naravane has shone spotlight on rules and regulations.

Showdown In Parliament As Rahul Gandhi Quotes Ex-Army Chief Naravane’s Book on China

In a bid to embarrass govt, Rahul has made it a habit to demoralise armed forces: BJP

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice on Monday, and finally for the day, after Opposition and Treasury benches clashed over Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi insisting on raising the issue of India-China confrontation of Aug 2020 on the basis of purported extracts from a yet-to-be published book by former Army chief M M Naravane.He was interrupted repeatedly by defence minister Rajnath Singh and later home minister Amit Shah, who asked him not to quote from any unverified source. Gandhi was speaking on the motion for thanks to the President’s speech.Speaker Om Birla failed to defuse the situation even after he gave a ruling asking Gandhi not to refer to news articles or extracts from an unpublished book and speak only on what could be authenticated by placing it on record. The LoP maintained that he should be allowed to speak on the issue, saying excerpts of the unpublished book had been published in Caravan magazine and were authentic.When the clashes continued even after two adjournments, the chair finally adjourned the proceedings for the day.The ruckus began in LS as Gandhi was called to speak on the motion just after BJP’s Tejashwi Surya spoke, recalling how presidential addresses during the 10 years of UPA regime were marked with references to Left wing violence and bomb blasts across the country, and about sinking economic growth.As per the report cited by Rahul, in the unpublished book, Naravane, the Army chief from 2019 to 2022, had given some accounts of the closed-door discussions he had had with the authorities seeking permission to act against the advancing Chinese Army after the Galwan clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Gandhi said he was forced to rake up the issue after BJP made references to Congress’s functioning during the previous UPA regime.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju interrupted Gandhi every time he mentioned the clash with the Chinese army, saying the chair has already given its ruling and the same is binding on all members, and the discussion should be confined to the motion of thanks to the President’s address.But Rahul said it was legitimate for him to answer as the defence minister, HM and PM often raise questions on “our character”. The article raised questions about the PM, HM and defence minister, and he was not being allowed to speak, he said.Later, accusing PM Narendra Modi of avoiding a decision in the face of Chinese aggression, Rahul said the Modi govt is afraid that General Naravane’s book would reveal to the people the “reality”— the reason govt is not allowing the publication of the book and permitting the leader of the opposition to speak in Lok Sabha.Congress MP KC Venugopal accused the Modi govt of distorting parliamentary rules to stop Rahul Gandhi from raising a genuine issue. He said rule 349 being cited by govt to stall Rahul’s speech states that a member “shall not read any book, newspaper or letter except in connection with the business of the House”. He said the business of the house is the President’s joint address, of which national security is a central issue.BJP on Monday accused Rahul Gandhi of weaponising national security to demoralise the armed forces in his bid to embarrass govt and sought to turn the tables by citing past comments of former Army chief Gen M M Naravane in which he had stressed that not an inch of Indian land was lost to China during the recent conflict.“Rahul Gandhi’s conduct was shameful. It has become his habit to demoralise the armed forces and using them to embarrass the govt,” BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters, emphasising that there were dozens of videos of Gen Naravane highlighting how India stood up to the “bully” China and gave it a befitting reply during the 2020 conflict. Not an inch of land was lost, he said quoting the ex-Army chief.BJP’s strident attack on the Congress leader came after his attempt to quote from a magazine that claimed to have accessed Gen Naravane’s unpublished memoir created a ruckus in Lok Sabha, drawing strong protests from ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh and a ruling from Speaker Om Birla that he cannot refer to a book which is not published.Rahul later attacked the govt in comments to media outside Parliament after Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day as he kept returning to the article.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju alleged that Rahul was using the sensitive issue of national security as a weapon for political reasons. “Don’t play with national security by speaking the language of anti-India elements,” he said, accusing Rahul of defying the chair.Rijiju then referred to the loss of Indian territory to China during the 1962 war to seek Rahul’s apology. “Does he think is he is above Parliament as he does not follow rules?” he asked.","Lok sabha was adjourned thrice on monday, and finally for the day, after opposition and treasury benches clashed.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

NEW DELHI: Air India Monday grounded one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner (VT-ANX) after the crew operating this aircraft from London to Bengaluru reported an issue with the locking mechanism of the fuel control switch.Boeing says it is ""in contact with AI and supporting their review of this matter.""The aircraft had taken off from London at 9.19 pm Sunday from Heathrow and landed in Bengaluru Monday 11.54 am (all timings local). Airline sources say the pilot observed an issue with the switch after landing and reported the same.However according to Safety Matters Foundation: “On Feb 2, 2026, during the operation of Air India Flight AI132 (London Heathrow to Bengaluru), the crew reported abnormal behaviour of the LEFT engine fuel control switch on Boeing 787 VT-ANX. During engine start, the switch failed to remain locked in the RUN position on two attempts, moving towards CUTOFF—a malfunction that could, under specific conditions, lead to an inadvertent engine shutdown in flight. ”""Left fuel control switch slips from on to cut off when pushed down slightly. It does not lock in its position,"" says the pilot in his report filed with the airline.This development assumes significance as on June 12, 2025, an AI B787 (VT-ANB) operating as AI 171 had crashed in Ahmedabad seconds after take off killing 260 people, because of fuel supply to its engines drying up as the switch had moved from run to cut off.It is not yet conclusively known why the switch was cut off — whether due to a mechanical fault or otherwise.Also read| Air India plane crash: What are the fuel control switches under scrutiny? What they do and why they matter About the Bengaluru grounding, AI said in a statement: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. At Air India, the safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority.”The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing this latest scare and has sought information from the airline. Comments have been sought from Boeing as well.Boeing Dreamliner’s Fuel control switches came into sharp focus after the Ahmedabad crash. “In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff (the fuel control switch). The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” says AI 171 crash preliminary investigation report of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.After the crash, AI had checked the fuel control switches of all its Dreamliners and had found no issues with them.Aviation safety expert Captain Amit Singh said: “What makes this (Monday scare) deeply troubling is not only that it happened, but that it occurred after Air India publicly stated it had conducted precautionary checks across its 787 fleet and found no issues. This raises urgent questions: Were the checks thorough? Is this a new, recurring defect? Passengers and crews deserve unambiguous answers.”Singh’s Safety matters Foundation said in a statement, “This incident is especially alarming as it mirrors a known risk previously identified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In 2018, the FAA issued safety alert for operators, explicitly warning that certain fuel control switches, including those on Boeing 787s, could malfunction in this exact manner, increasing the risk of accidental engine shutdown. The FAA recommended inspection and replacement of affected units.”","Boeing says it is ""in contact with ai and supporting their review of this matter"" the aircraft had taken off from london at 9.19 pm sunday from heathrow and landed in bengaluru monday 11.54 am.

He said that the move followed legal reforms in Venezuela that have opened the oil sector to private investment after the US capture of President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.India and the United States have been holding trade talks since March 2025.

Two suspects detained in Samba; searches launched in Udhampur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-suspects-detained-in-samba-searches-launched-in-udhampur/articleshow/127870532.cms,"Representative photo

JAMMU: Two terror suspects were detained in Cantonment Area in J&K’s Samba district on Monday, even as multiple cordon-and-search operations continued across several regions of Jammu division, including snowbound Kishtwar’s Chatroo-Dolgam-Dichhar belt, where Operation Trashi-I entered its 16th day. Late Sunday, a search operation was launched in Joffer area in Udhampur’s Rampur sector following reports of suspicious movement.“Terrorist movement was reported in the upper reaches of Udhampur. Search operations are also underway in the high-altitude, forested areas of Poonch, Rajouri, Kathua, Doda, and Reasi districts,” an official said.Around 10.30am Monday, a Quick Reaction Team caught two men near an old quarter of the Army in railway area. “One person was sleeping outside, near the shaft, while the other was found inside. Both were taken into custody and sent to Bari Brahmana PS for further action,” an official source said. “One of the men was identified as Muneer Khan from Chang, in Jammu district. He said he works in Flaxfour Company, Bari Brahmana. The other man was identified as Pawan Singh from Neeli village in Udhampur district,” the source added.On Jan 6, Punjab Police detained a minor in Pathankot on charges of spying and for allegedly sharing confidential information via social media to terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers. The detention prompted a statewide alert for similar espionage activities involving children.Due to its proximity to the international border, Samba serves as a gateway for terrorists to reach Kashmir Valley via the upper reaches of Samba-Udhampur-Doda-Kishtwar. The district remains a hotspot of terrorist activities.Under Operation Trashi-I, security forces have engaged in four encounters with terrorists in the past fortnight.

On Jan 22, another gunfight broke out with holed-up ultras in Singhpora. Yet another firefight followed on Jan 24, in which a Pakistani Jaish terrorist was shot dead. A brief gun battle occurred in Dolgam on Jan 31.Braving inclement weather, troops have been trudging through hostile, forested terrain to track and kill a group of three holed-up ultras. Security agencies were also trying to trace terrorist sympathisers who may have helped the ultras with food and shelter. Mobile internet services (all bandwidths) have remained temporarily suspended within a 6km-radius covering Singhpora, Chingam, and Chatroo since Jan 30 as a security measure.Officials said the terrorists, on the run for more than two weeks now, had been continuously changing hideouts. Additional forces were roped in to fortify the cordon, and sniffer dogs were deployed to assist the troops on the ground. The region was put under aerial surveillance using drones and choppers to plug possible escape routes.",Two terror suspects were detained in cantonment area in j&k’s samba district on monday.

'I'm quoting an article': Rahul Gandhi reiterates his stance

NEW DELHI: The Budget Session of Parliament witnessed sharp exchanges on Monday after Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from an unpublished memoir of former Army chief Gen MM Naravane (retd) during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address.The incident triggered strong objections from the treasury benches, leading to repeated disruptions and adjournments. Following the prolonged deadlock, the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day and will reconvene at 11 am on Tuesday.The controversy erupted when Gandhi rose to respond to remarks by BJP MP Tejasvi Surya , who had questioned the Congress party’s nationalism. Gandhi said that he wanted to counter those allegations by citing passages related to the India-China border situation from what he described as the former Army chief’s memoir.However, defence minister Rajnath Singh objected, questioning whether the book being cited had been formally published or authenticated. He told the House that unpublished material could not be quoted and accused the Congress leader of misleading Parliament.Speaker Om Birla subsequently ruled that unpublished books or magazine articles not directly related to the proceedings could not be read out in the House.Despite the ruling, Congress leader maintained that the excerpts he was referring to were authentic and available through a published magazine article citing the memoir, triggering repeated protests from treasury benches and counter-sloganeering from the Opposition.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju later accused Gandhi of defying the Speaker and violating House rules. Speaking to reporters, Rijiju said the Leader of Opposition had ignored the Chair’s ruling repeatedly.“Right from the beginning, Rahul Gandhi flouted rules. Even after the Speaker’s ruling, he kept repeating the same mistake and wasted half an hour of the House,” Rijiju said.Union minister Giriraj Singh also criticised Gandhi’s conduct, calling it “childish behaviour.” He said the dignity of the House required members to adhere strictly to the agenda under discussion.“The way Rahul Gandhi is displaying indiscipline and refusing to obey the Speaker’s orders is unfortunate. He should have confined himself to the President’s Address,” Singh said.BJP MP Jagdambika Pal described the episode as unprecedented and embarrassing. “This must have happened for the first time since Independence that a member was asked repeatedly to stop and still continued. His address was condemnable and action should be taken,” Pal said.The Opposition, however, rallied firmly behind Gandhi, accusing the government of stifling debate on national security. Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Gandhi was not attempting to defame the armed forces.“He was not trying to defame the army. He was reading an excerpt attributed to a former Army chief. The government always reacts like this when something uncomfortable comes out,” she said.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, ""He never got a chance to lay out his concerns. The article does not blame the forces or the soldiers at all. The issue is about some of the decisions that were taken or not taken by the central government. And that clearly is what Rahul ji intended to raise. All I can say is I think the government did not need to overreact.""Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said that it was unfortunate that the Leader of Opposition was not allowed to speak on an issue of national importance. “National security is a crucial issue. Not allowing him to speak on this matter is not right. We hope the Speaker will give justice,” Hooda said.Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that Gandhi had raised substantive issues related to Doklam, Ladakh and India-China relations. Accusing the government of avoiding scrutiny, Singhvi said, “Instead of answering questions, you are blocking them. This suppresses matters of public interest.”Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee alleged that Parliament was losing its democratic character. “Every right of MPs is being taken away. If someone has violated rules, there are procedures, but this is not the way,” he said.Congress MP Karti Chidambaram questioned the demand for an apology over historical events. “What happened in 1962 happened in 1962. Rahul Gandhi was not part of the government then. We want to discuss the conduct of the present government, which the former Army chief has written about,” he said, adding that those views appeared “inconvenient” for the ruling dispensation.TMC MP Mahua Moitra widened the attack, alleging intimidation of Opposition voices both inside and outside Parliament. She cited restrictions faced by people at Banga Bhawan in Delhi as an example of shrinking democratic space.As tempers flared, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav urged the Speaker to allow the Leader of Opposition to speak, saying issues related to China were sensitive and deserved discussion.Despite interventions, the deadlock persisted, forcing multiple adjournments of the Lok Sabha before proceedings were finally suspended for the day.During the session, Gandhi defended his attempt to raise the issue, asserting that national security should not be curtailed in parliamentary debate. Speaking inside the House amid the uproar, he said that the matter had made the government uncomfortable.“I consider national security to be the most important issue in the country. I understand that it has made the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister uncomfortable. If they are not, they should allow me to speak. Rajnath Singh ji is sitting here and he is aware of this matter. He is the person who spoke to General Naravane,” Gandhi said.After the House was adjourned, the Congress leader reiterated his position while speaking to reporters outside Parliament, insisting that he was not expressing personal views but referring to the former Army chief’s account.“This is not me, this is what the Army Chief (former) has written in a book. The book is not being allowed to be published. It is languishing, and this is the Army Chief's perspective,” Gandhi said.Questioning the government’s objections, he asked why it was reluctant to allow discussion on the contents attributed to the memoir.“Why are they so scared of what the Army Chief has to say? We will learn something from it. Of course, we will learn something about a Prime Minister. We will learn something about Rajnath Singh ji. But we will also learn something about the Army and how it was let down by the political leadership of the country,” he said.Congress leader further claimed that the references to the memoir had already appeared in a published article and that he was quoting from that source.“I am quoting the article. They are not letting me speak. They are scared because if it comes out, the reality of Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh will be revealed to the people and what happened to the 56-inch chest when China was standing against us, advancing?” he asked.","Budget session of parliament witnessed sharp exchanges on monday after rahul gandhi attempted to quote from an unpublished memoir of former army chief gen mm naravane.

Ajit Pawar’s Sudden Air Crash Death Sparks Massive Shockwave Across Bollywood and Politics

Parliament panel on Ajit Pawar's death

MUMBAI: India’s charter aviation sector has grown steadily, filling a crucial gap left by airlines by connecting smaller towns & airports. But industry insiders say safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards. Implementation of pilots' flight duty time limits, maintenance standards & weather-related decision-making vary widely between operatorsCharter flying offers speed, flexibility and access to places far beyond an airline’s scheduled network, making it the fastest way to reach remote destinations. But this convenience, which is the very core that defines charter operations, also exposes a fundamental difference in how safety is prioritised. Unlike in airline operations, decisions on whether to operate or land are often taken closer to the cockpit, where passenger urgency and convenience can weigh heavily, sometimes pushing safety to the second place.“Non-scheduled flights carry high-net-worth passengers with a fixed objective, an event, a meeting, a function. That creates immense pressure on pilots to land at the intended destination at all costs, even when diversion would be the safer option,” said Capt Manoj Hathi, former senior flight operations inspector at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Capt R K Bali of the Business Aircraft Operators Association said India’s non-scheduled aircraft operators have a fleet of about 300 aircraft. “The need of the hour is a pre-flight open, clear communication between pilot and the passenger. The pilot should carry out an objective assessment of the risk involved for a given flight and brief the passenger especially when flying into a small uncontrolled airport with no landing aids in marginal weather conditions. The pilot should be under no duress from anyone to make the landing, because ultimately the buck stops at the pilot”.But that is often not the case. A senior pilot spoke about the pressure the crew comes under. “When a politician travels by road, traffic is stopped, junctions sealed and inconvenience is imposed on everyone else in the name of the VIP safety. When the same politician travels by air, the inconvenience quietly shifts to rest solely on the pilot. A chartered aircraft is expected to get in and get out, often to small airfields and on tight timelines because a meeting, a rally or a public appearance cannot be missed. ”Then there are other aspects that influence the safety standards in charter aircraft operations. Unlike scheduled airlines, where pilot flight duty time limitations are tightly monitored and crew can be replaced at short notice, charter operations operate with limited manpower. “There is an expectation that you should be able to fly whenever you want. Passengers are frequently late, and replacement crew are rarely available except at the main base,” said Capt Hathi. Irregular schedules also impact pilot proficiency. Charter pilots often lack the consistency that airline crew benefit from, affecting skill retention and operational discipline. The sector also struggles to retain experienced flight crew. “Many first officers and captains see charter flying as a steppingstone to airlines. Attrition is high. Many captains are older, retired from airlines, or were not selected elsewhere,” said an operator.Capt Hathi said, “Training infrastructure is another weak point. Most non-scheduled operators do not have dedicated training departments comparable to airlines, largely due to cost constraints. Refresher training and procedural updates are often left to self-study. The problem is compounded when operators maintain multiple aircraft types within small fleets, making standardisation of procedures difficult. ”Short-notice flights such as medical evacuations or emergency travel add another layer of complexity. “There is often insufficient time for proper briefing or preparation,” said a source. Compounding this, pilots in charter operations are responsible for tasks that airlines distribute across multiple departments. Flight preparation, loading calculations, technical documentation and coordination are often handled solely by pilots, meaning their effective duty begins hours before the recorded reporting time. These factors create a system where compliance depends heavily on individual operators and pilots rather than institutional safeguards as is the case with airlines.","Safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards.

How long you will live is mainly decided by your genes: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-long-you-will-live-is-mainly-decided-by-your-genes-study/articleshow/127873493.cms,"Representative image

How much do genes decide

NEW DELHI: You can eat right, exercise daily and avoid every bad habit — but your genes may still have a major say on how long you live. A major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics, challenging the belief that lifestyle and environment shape longevity the most.Published in Science, the research shows that once deaths caused by accidents, infections and other external factors are excluded, about 55% of the human lifespan is heritable, meaning that more than half of the observed variation in longevity across a population is attributable to genetics. That is a much greater proportion than the previous estimates of 10-25%, according to the research, published on Jan 29.The findings are based on an analysis of more than a century of lifespan data from large Scandinavian twin cohorts in Denmark and Sweden. Researchers studied identical and non-identical twins raised together and apart, as well as siblings of US centenarians. Most participants were born between 1870 and 1935, a period marked by high mortality from infectious diseases and accidents.By separating such “extrinsic” deaths from those linked to biological ageing, the study found the true influence of genetics on longevity had been masked. Once these external causes were accounted for, lifespan similarities between identical twins became far stronger.It also helps explain why genetic influence on lifespan appears clearer today. As deaths from infections, violence and accidents have declined over time, role of genes in determining longevity has become more visible.Indian experts say the findings carry important public health implications. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC, said genetics plays a major role in biological ageing but warned that Indian conditions could blunt this advantage. “About half of human lifespan is genetically determined once external causes are excluded, but poor nutrition, air pollution, and rising diabetes and obesity can override genetic advantages and accelerate biological ageing,” he said.Dr Ambrish Mithal, group chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Max Healthcare, said longevity reflects a balance between inheritance and environment. “Genetics provides a broad upper limit for lifespan, while epigenetics and lifestyle determine how close one comes to that limit,” he said, explaining that environmental factors can switch genes on or off without altering DNA itself. Scientists caution the findings do not mean that lifespan is fixed at birth. Nearly half of lifespan variation is still shaped by lifestyle, healthcare access and living conditions. However, the study suggests that genes set the biological ceiling — and the environment determines whether people reach it. Researchers say the findings could reshape debates on ageing and longevity, while reinforcing the urgency of tackling risks that shorten the biological lifespan.","Major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics.

'Regime Changes In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal Building Cases Of Bad Governance': NSA Ajit Doval

NEW DELHI: Justifying detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk under National Security Act, govt on Monday told Supreme Court that he was trying to create political and social unrest in Ladakh and was making an attempt to emulate what happened in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.Appearing before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the activist was appealing to Gen Z to come out on the street against govt to create a problem in Ladakh which is very sensitive as it shares borders with countries that are not very friendly. Responding to Wangchuk’s submission that he was holding a peaceful protest against govt on the line of Gandhian principles, the SG said, “Gandhi was just a facade to hide his real intention of instigating violence. ”Mehta said the activist was detained as per law and there was no violation in the procedure. He said the order of detention was served upon him which took almost four hours as he was shown all of his offensive video clips which was relied upon to detain him. The entire procedure was videograpped.Reading out Wangchuk’s speech, the SG told SC he was talking about the Arab Spring and what happened in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to instigate people to come out in large numbers against govt. “You are asking Gen Z to come out. You are anticipating or hoping for a riot-like situation in Nepal. It is a clear instigation... Comparison with Mahatma Gandhi is fallacious and only a facade to hide inflammatory and instigatory speech,” he told the bench.",Sonam wangchuk was detained under national security act.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk attempted to ""instigate"" Ladakh’s youth for protests inspired by regime-toppling movements in neighoburing Nepal and Bangladesh, the Centre and the Union territory administration said in the Supreme Court on Monday.Wangchuk was detained in September last year two days after deadly violence during pro-statehood protests in his native Ladakh. He is detained under the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and has been lodged in a prison in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.The NSA empowers the Centre and states to detain individuals to prevent them from acting in a manner ""prejudicial to the defence of India"". The maximum detention period is 12 months, although it can be revoked earlier.The Supreme Court is currently hearing a writ petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife, social entrepreneur Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention.“Wangchuk carefully crafted his speeches to mobilise Gen Z, urging agitations similar to those in Nepal and Bangladesh, while invoking Mahatma Gandhi’s speeches to mask his true intentions. He also referenced ‘Arab Spring’-style movements that led to the overthrow of multiple governments in the Arab world,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PV Varale.Mehta further alleged that the former educationist sought to create a rift between the central government and the people of Ladakh by framing the government as “them” and the people as “us.” He also claimed Wangchuk called for a “plebiscite” and “referendum.""“There is no ‘them’ or ‘us’—we are all Indians. Ladakh shares borders with China and Pakistan, making it a very fragile region. His speeches must be considered in their entirety. He was allegedly misleading young people while selectively invoking Mahatma Gandhi, who never incited people against their own government,” the SG told the bench.Mehta argued that the district magistrate of Leh—the Union Territory capital where violence erupted on September 24, 2025—had carefully reviewed relevant materials, including videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, before issuing the preventive detention order. “It took four hours for the detention order to be executed. After the district magistrate passed it, a DIG-rank officer briefed him and showed him videos of Wangchuk’s speeches, explaining the grounds for detention,” the SG noted.Addressing the petitioner's contention that the district magistrate relied on “borrowed material,” Mehta maintained that this argument is flawed. “The district magistrate is not required to witness every speech firsthand. Officials who heard the speeches recorded videos and submitted them as evidence. Based on these materials, the order was passed,” he contended.The arguments remained inconclusive and are set to continue on Tuesday.","Sonam wangchuk was detained in september last year two days after deadly violence during pro-statehood protests in his native ladakh.

Whether the land was taken or not, that's a different question. We'll come to that. But before we come to that, the leader of the country is supposed to give direction. The leader of the country is not supposed to run away from decisions and leave decisions to other people's shoulders. That is what the Prime Minister has done,"" Rahul told reporters after the lower house was adjourned repeatedly amid uproar over his speech.""I am not being allowed to speak. I just have to speak 2-3 lines. It is a matter of national security. These are the words of the Army Chief (former), and it is a conversation that he has had with Rajnath Singh ji and PM Modi.All I am saying is that I want to say in the House what the Army Chief (former) has written and what orders did Rajnath Singh and PM Modi give him,"" he added.Continuing his attack on the central government, Rahul said that the Army was ""let down"" by the political leadership during the Galwan clash. Rahul said that the PM and the defence minister was scared of ""one line"" that is there in the memoir which he was being denied to say, claiming that he would say it in the Parliament.""They are scared of a line. There is one line in it that PM Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh are scared of. I will say that line inside Parliament, and no one will stop me,"" he said.Citing Naravane's memoir which remains unpublished, Rahul asked why the Centre was ""so scared what the Army Chief has to say?""""We will learn something from it. Of course, we will learn something about a Prime Minister. We will learn something about Rajnath Singh ji. But we will also learn something about the Army and how it was let down by the political leadership of the country. I'm saying that Naravane ji has clearly written about the Prime Minister and Rajnath Singh ji in his book,"" he said.""It has appeared in an article. I am quoting the article. They are not letting me speak... They are scared because if it comes out, the reality of Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh will be revealed to the people and what happened to the 56-inch chest when China was standing against us, advancing?"" he added.The uproar in Parliament was triggered when Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from the unpublished “memoir” of former Army chief Gen M M Naravane on the 2020 India-China conflict during the Motion of Thanks debate, drawing strong objections from defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP MPs, who accused him of “misleading the House.”Gandhi said he was responding to BJP MP Tejasvi Surya’s remarks questioning the Congress’ nationalism and began citing what he claimed were excerpts from Naravane’s memoir on the 2020 India-China border clash.Despite repeated warnings from Speaker Om Birla that unpublished material could not be quoted, Gandhi insisted the document was authenticated, triggering sustained protests from the treasury benches. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju accused Gandhi of violating House rules, following which the Speaker adjourned the House multiple times amid continued deadlock.The BJP dismissed Rahul's claims as ""misleading"" with Amit Malviya sharing several videos of the ex-Army chief speaking on the Galwan clash.""Not only of the PLA itself, but I feel it diminished the stature of China as a country in the global eyes. After this clash occurred and we showed that it is possible to stand up to China, who tries to bully its smaller neighbours. Once we did that, from Canada to Lithuanian to Europe to Phillipines everyone got that feeling that if you are fighting for what is correct, if you have a principled stand, it is possible to take a stand even against China. And we don't have to always be cowed down by might that they try to project,"" Naravane was heard saying in one interview.In another, he confirmed that India had not lost even an ""inch"" of its territory to China. ""Firstly, we haven't lost out on any territory. We are where we were before this whole thing started. As a result of this agreement, it has been reached on the principle of mutual and equal security. I think that should be the whole disengagement process. It serves the interests of both the countries to have agreed to a stable LAC without any confrontation taking place. That should be the larger view of the deal,"" he said.However, the videos shared by Malviya did not address Rahul's claim of PM running away from decision-making during the clash.","Rahul gandhi was repeatedly denied permission to quote mm naravane's unpublished memoir in parliament. The bjp dismissed rahul's claims as ""misleading"" with amit malviya sharing several videos of ex-army chief speaking on the galwan clash. Naravane said india had not lost even an ""inch"" of its territory to china.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127861155,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-964115,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

What led the Parliament ruckus ?

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on Monday took a sharp dig at the Centre during the Parliament Budget Session, dismissing claims of ""ruckus in the House"" and accusing the ruling party of repeatedly targeting the opposition branding them ""deshdrohi. "" She further took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, questioning restrictions placed on Opposition speeches in the House.Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Moitra said, ""There was no ruckus in Parliament. It is unbelievable how the ruling party and the treasury benches, including the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, can say anything about the Opposition.""""Are you telling me India–China relations cannot be referred to in the House? India–Pakistan relations cannot be referred to in the House? India–US relations cannot be referred to in the House?"" she asked.She added sarcastically, ""What should we talk about? Sit down and do Jai Pradhan Mantri? Is that all we should do in the House?”She alleged that Opposition leaders are routinely branded unpatriotic. ""They call us unpatriotic.They call us deshdrohi. They cast aspersions on us and it’s all okay. There is no rule ever stopping that. They can say anything,"" she said.The TMC MP alleged that ruling party members are allowed wide latitude while the Opposition is curtailed. ""Somebody like Tejasvi Surya can stand up and say anything and it is applauded. And then, when we as the Opposition stand up to say something, our rights are taken away and we are told there is a ruling on it,"" she said.Referring to Rule 349, Moitra argued that discussions were well within parliamentary business. ""What is in the business of the House today is the President’s Address, and the President talks about everything,"" she added.Moitra’s remarks came amid a heated exchange in the Lok Sabha after leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi attempted to quote from a report citing excerpts from the unpublished memoir of former Army Chief General MM Naravane during the motion of thanks on the President’s Address.Challenging the government’s objections, Rahul asked, ""What does it contain which is scaring them so much? If they are not scared, I should be allowed to read on.""Defence minister Rajnath Singh objected to Rahul quoting from an unpublished book, stating it had not been authenticated.""I want that LoP, Lok Sabha, should present before the House the book he is quoting from, because the book he is referring to has not been published,"" Singh said.NDA MPs echoed the objection, arguing that parliamentary rules do not permit references to unpublished material.Responding to allegations by BJP MP Tejasvi Surya questioning the Congress’s patriotism, Rahul said he wanted to read from the memoir.""A young colleague over there made an allegation against the Congress Party… because he has raised the issue about our patriotism, our understanding of Indian culture, I'd like to start by reading something,"" Rahul said.He added, ""And this is from the memoir of Army Chief Naravane. And I'd like you to listen nicely. You will understand exactly who is patriotic, who is not.""Referring to the Doklam standoff, Rahul said, ""It will take a little while, so this is about when four Chinese tanks were entering Indian territory. They were taking a ridge in Doklam.""While Rahul maintained that the excerpts appeared in a published magazine article citing Naravane’s memoir, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla ruled that unpublished material could not be read out in the House and denied permission to proceed.Opposition members protested the ruling, demanding that Rahul be allowed to read the excerpts, while treasury bench members insisted House rules barred references to unpublished works.The episode led to sharp verbal exchanges in the Lok Sabha, further escalating tensions during the Budget Session.","Tmc mp mahua moitra took a sharp dig at the centre during the parliament budget session.
