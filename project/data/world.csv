"Partition’s unanswered questions still haunt India, says Mani Shankar Aiyar after Pahalgam attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/partitions-unanswered-questions-still-haunt-india-says-mani-shankar-aiyar-after-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/120659292.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned whether the unresolved legacy of Partition is reflected in the horrific tragedy that unfolded in Pahalgam. Speaking at a book launch event at the India International Centre in New Delhi, Aiyar said the fundamental question posed to India during Partition still remains unanswered.""Many people almost prevented Partition, but it happened because there were differences in value systems and assessments of the nature of India's nationhood and its civilisational inheritance between people like Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Jinnah and many other Muslims who did not agree with Mr Jinnah,"" he said.""But in today's India, does a Muslim feel that he is accepted? Does a Muslim feel that he is cherished? Does a Muslim feel that he is celebrated? Why should I answer my own questions? Ask any Muslim and you will get the answers,"" he added.""But the fact is that the Partition happened and till today we are living with the consequences of that Partition. Is this how we should be living? Is that the unresolved questions of the Partition reflected in the terrible tragedy... in Pahalgam on April 22,"" Aiyar added.Reflecting on history, Aiyar recalled that Pakistan's ambition of being the homeland and protector of Muslims in the subcontinent collapsed after the 1971 war, when Bangladesh broke away to assert its Bengali identity over a purely religious one.""It was the failure to understand that every salvation has more than one dimension to this identity that was responsible for what happened to Pakistan in 1971,"" he said.Aiyar further added that the questions India faced then pre-Partition and one that continues to resonate today is what should be done with what were around 100 million Muslims at the time, and nearly 200 million now.""Do we accept Jinnah's view and say 'no, they are a separate nation living amongst us as saboteurs or potential saboteurs', or do we look at them and say 'they are part and parcel of us'? Do we define ourselves as a composite or do we say 'no, we have only one dimension in our identity and that is the religious dimension of Hinduism'?""On April 22, terrorists attacked tourists at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam, south Kashmir, killing 26 people, including a Nepali national. It was the deadliest assault in the region since the 2019 Pulwama attack. In the aftermath, the government vowed severe punishment for the perpetrators, while also launching major crackdowns on terrorist networks across Jammu and Kashmir.","Mani shankar aiyar questioned whether the unresolved legacy of partition is reflected in the horrific tragedy that unfolded in pahalgam.

'People had forgotten the bunkers'



NEW DELHI: In the remote border villages of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir , life has once again taken a cautious turn. Following the terror attack in Pahalgam which killed 26 and sent shockwaves across the Union territory, residents living along the Line of Control (LoC) have begun cleaning and preparing their underground bunkers — a stark reminder of the volatility that once defined daily life here.The bunkers, popularly known as "" Modi bunkers "" are being stacked with essentials like blankets and bedding, with villagers bracing for the worst.""Modi bunker” is an informal term used to describe the underground bunkers constructed along the Line of Control (LoC) to protect civilians from cross-border shelling. These bunkers, built in large numbers during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's second tenure, were part of a major government initiative to enhance the safety of residents living near conflict-prone border areas.In the past, the government has extended financial aid and technical assistance for building individual and community bunkers in high-risk areas like Poonch and Rajouri.In 2021, around 8,000 underground bunkers were built along the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB) in Jammu province, officials said.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday said he was not in favour of “war” with Pakistan, as tensions between the two countries escalated following the deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam which killed 26 people.Speaking to reporters, Siddaramaiah called for strengthening security in the Kashmir Valley and stressed that measures must be taken to ensure peace. “There has been a security lapse in this incident. We are not in favour of war. Steps should be taken to tighten security measures in the Kashmir region. The central government should increase security to ensure peace in Kashmir,” he said.Siddaramaiah added that his government would work to send back Pakistani nationals residing in Karnataka as directed by the central government. “Steps will be taken to send back Pakistani citizens as per the instructions of the central government. Information will be obtained about the number of Pakistanis in various cities of the state,” he said.His remarks have drawn sharp criticism from the BJP. Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly, R Ashoka, accused Siddaramaiah of lacking awareness and said the chief minister should focus on local security.“All parties, including the national leadership of your own Congress party, have unanimously said that they will support any decision taken by the Central Government. Our country has professional armed forces. Our armed forces possess the expertise and experience to determine the appropriate course of action in any given situation.

‘Save your neck first’

Protests erupt overseas

Delhi minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Saturday delivered a scathing rebuke to Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari after his provocative warning to India over the Indus Waters Treaty Responding to Bhutto’s threat that “either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,” Sirsa shot back, “Then drown in it (Indus river)... They don't have the guts to shed blood. They are crying for water and talk about shedding blood. They should be ashamed.”The sharp exchange came after India formally suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 tourists. The Resistance Front, widely seen as a Pakistan-backed proxy, claimed responsibility.Bhutto, speaking along the Indus River in Sukkur, had accused India of using the attack as a ""false excuse"" to undermine international norms, calling India’s move “illegal and against humanity.” He vowed to take the matter to international forums.Meanwhile, India, citing demographic shifts, energy needs, and Pakistan’s continued patronage of terrorism, invoked Article XII(3) of the treaty. The ministry of Jal Shakti formally notified Pakistan that the treaty could no longer be honoured in good faith.The war of words didn’t stop there.

Be careful. An apocalypse is hovering over your head.”Sirsa also slammed viral images of cake celebrations at Pakistan’s embassy in Delhi just days after the Pahalgam terror attack , saying, ""Our army is capable of giving a fitting reply. We don’t need to waste words on those who celebrate while innocents are slaughtered.""Over 500 members of the Indian diaspora gathered outside the Pakistan Embassy in London to protest the Pahalgam killings. Holding Indian flags and placards, protestors demanded justice and accused Pakistan of running a “terror factory.”Adding to the anger, protestors accused the Pakistan High Commission of blaring loud celebratory music during the demonstration—a move organisers called “tone-deaf and disgraceful” amid a national tragedy.Speaking to ANI, a protestor summed up the sentiment: ""Because of Pakistan's terror factories, 26 of our people were slaughtered. Today, we are their voice.""The April 22 attack left 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen dead, drawing widespread condemnation and escalating tensions between the two nations.","Delhi minister sirsa’s fiery retort to bilawal bhutto over indus threat sparks war of words.

Can a thief ever investigate his own theft?” Speaking to reporters, he added, “The Prime Minister of Pakistan is saying this out of fear. This fear is good—he should have this fear. When Pakistan is not prepared, that's when we will hit them, and we will hit them hard.”The Pahalgam attack, which targeted tourists at the Baisaran meadow, left 26 people dead, 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen, and injured several others. India has blamed cross-border terrorist networks for orchestrating the massacre.Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, responding from Ramban, dismissed Pakistan’s offer for a probe outright. “First of all, they did not even recognise that something had happened in Pahalgam. First, they said that India was behind it,” Abdullah said. ""For the people who made allegations against us in the first place, it is difficult to say anything about it now. I don't want to give much importance to their statements.""The brutal attack has sparked a sweeping crackdown across Jammu and Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Fifteen local Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) and terror aides have been identified, based on electronic surveillance, as the key suspects who may have facilitated the Pakistani assailants behind the Pahalgam carnage. They are believed to have arranged logistics and, possibly, also received arms consignments from Pakistan.Sources said the multi-agency probe has zeroed in on five prime suspects, of whom three have been ""picked up"", and may eventually face arrest. Police are on the lookout for the two other OGWs. All five were in the vicinity on the day of the strike, and earlier: their phones were active in the area.Electronic surveillance threw up a chat in which the three detained prime suspects are talking to each other about Pakistani terrorists in Pahalgam and how to ""help"" them.Meanwhile, more than 200 OGWs have been detained for questioning to trace the likely events leading up to the attack, said sources.Sources said there is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to the role of all five in the Pahalgam strike. Ten other OGWs are being questioned by a joint interrogation team comprising investigators from NIA, J&K Police, Intelligence Bureau and RAW, as they are known to have helped Pakistan terrorists in Kashmir in the past and happened to be in the vicinity of the attack site on April 22.The 15 local terror aides - all from south Kashmir - are already 'indexed' by the J&K police as OGWs and are believed to have facilitated Pakistani terrorists involved in multiple attacks across south Kashmir over the past couple of years, helping with logistics, guiding them through the jungles and even receiving consignments of arms from Pakistan for use in terror strikes,"" a source told TOI.""There is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to their role as facilitators and in arranging logistics for the Pahalgam attack team, which comprised 4-5 terrorists, of whom at least two were Pakistanis and two local Kashmiris. We are trying to get more details out of the 15 detained OGWs to piece together the conspiracy, before taking a call on their likely arrest,"" said an officer.As of Saturday, more than 200 OGWs were detained and questioned to help uncover the sequence of events leading up to the Pahalgam attack.""Around 20-25 OGWs are detained for questioning. These are OGWs known to be in touch with, shelter and act as 'guides' to Pakistani terrorists. We are sifting through OGW database, having questioned over 1,500 of them, and have now zeroed in on 15 likely suspects. At the same time, other OGWs active in south Kashmir are being questioned to fill us in on the identity of Pakistani terrorists seen in the area and their possible hideouts,"" said an officer.Sources said security personnel combing the forests encircling Baisaran for escaped terrorists, have further intensified the search.

Pak-China tried to dilute UNSC statement phrasing



Pakistan, a non-permanent member of UN Security Council, joined other member-states in strongly condemning the Pahalgam attack but not before working to water it down with help from China. Pakistan, which has denied any role in the massacre, had so far only expressed concern at the loss of life.The council underlined the need for international collaboration to bring the perpetrators of the ""reprehensible act of terrorism"" to justice. However, while UNSC's condemnation of the 2019 Pulwama attack had called upon all states to cooperate actively with the ""government of India"" in that regard, on this occasion it only mentioned ""all relevant authorities"".In the case of Pulwama, the condemnation statement sought cooperation with both Indian government and relevant authorities.""Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,"" said the council, adding that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.TOI has learned that the consensus over the statement, proposed by the US, was preceded by some tough negotiations that saw Pakistan working with China to dilute its phrasing. In condemning several such terrorist attacks in the past, like in Pulwama and also Pakistan's own Jaffar Express train attack last month, the council had urged all states to cooperate actively with the local government and not just relevant authorities.Islamabad probably felt that a specific mention of the Indian government would give New Delhi a stick to beat it with. Instead of backing Indian investigations, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Saturday his country is open to a ""neutral and transparent"" probe into the attack.In the Pahalgam statement, the council condemned ""in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu & Kashmir"", while in the case of Pulwama, it condemned again in the strongest terms the ""heinous and cowardly suicide bombing"".On both occasions though, the council said the attacks took place in J&K, the term India uses for the Union Territory and erstwhile state. The rest of the statement was as per the standard format used by UNSC for condemning such terror attacks. Like in the case of Pulwama, the council said in its Pahalgam statement, too, that the perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of the ""reprehensible act of terrorism"" had to be held accountable and brought to justice.Meanwhile, a spokesperson said Saturday that UN continued to monitor developments in the region ""with very deep concern"" and urged India and Pakistan to exercise the maximum restraint to ensure the situation does not deteriorate further.","Pak-china tried to dilute unsc statement phrasing for pahalgam attack.

Action against hostile neighbour is dharma: Mohan Bhagwat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/action-against-hostile-neighbour-is-dharma-mohan-bhagwat/articleshow/120654782.cms,"Mohan Bhagwat (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Amidst growing clamour for action against Pakistan in the wake of Pahalgam terror killings, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that non-violence is ingrained in Indian culture , but taking action against a hostile neighbour is also ""dharma"".""We have by nature been non-violent. We never trouble our neighbours. But some people are spoiled, who do not follow their religion. In such a situation, the king must protect the people. For this, killing the oppressors is also his dharma. People remember the steps taken by the king to protect the people,"" Bhagwat said, in what was seen as full-throttle support for strong action against Pakistan being anticipated in the wake of the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack on innocent tourists in Pahalgam.The RSS chief suggested that terrorists did not deserve even the dignity given to Ravana, who since he was a believer, was vanquished by God and not by mortals. ""I mentioned Ravana in Mumbai because despite everything, his mind was against non-violence. That is why it was the God who killed. But our dharma don't not allow the delinquents (terrorists) to get the same respect.""His reference was seen as a direct endorsement of proactive action against Pakistan, which, a few sources have hinted, could be targeted against conspirators sitting in Pakistan, who have been consistently encouraging terror activities in India.Addressing a book release function, he said the principles of non-violence are based on making people embrace this thought. ""Many people embrace these principles wholeheartedly, while others do not do so and continue to foment trouble. In such a situation, the dharma states that that not letting ourselves be vanquished by aggressors is also a part of dharma (duty). Teaching deliquents a lesson is an obligation "" the RSS chief said. Bhagwat drew a distincction between religious beliefs and faith, on the one hand, and dharma or right and moral conduct, on the other. ""Saying that people needed to grasp the spirit of Sanatan Dharma, he, said ""religion does not qualify to dharma"" till it follows the four principles of satya (truth), suchita (purity), karuna (compassion) and tapasya (spiritual discipline). Whatever goes beyond this is adharma (immoral ),"" he said.Bhagwat said in the present times, religion has been reduced to rituals and eating habits. ""We have reduced religion to rituals and eating habitsThis is a code... not an ideal,"" the RSS chief added.","Rss chief mohan bhagwat says non-violence is ingrained in indian culture.

NEW DELHI: In what is being seen as a crude manoeuvre, The Resistance Front (TRF) - a proxy for Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has dramatically pedalled back on its publicly declared authorship of Pahalgam terror attack , blaming the earlier claim to a ""coordinated cyber intrusion"".On Saturday, it unequivocally denied any responsibility for the massacre of tourists who were targeted for being non-Muslim. ""...The Resistance Front unequivocally denies any involvement in Pahalgam incident. Any attribution of this act to TRF is false, hasty, & part of an orchestrated campaign to malign Kashmiri resistance ,"" its statement alleged.""Shortly after the Pahalgam attack, a brief and unauthorised message was posted from one of our digital platforms. After an internal audit, we have reason to believe it was the result of a coordinated cyber intrusion - a familiar tactic in Indian state's digital warfare arsenal,"" it further claimed.The latest statement came amid indications of the international community accepting India's stand that the terrorists belonged to LeT, a terrorist organisation supported by Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency, ISI , as part of their proxy war against India.Security establishment sources, however, said that the retraction was ludicrous and would serve little purpose. They said the move was merely a damage control measure by the ISI to escape accountability.","The resistance front (trf) - a proxy for pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba - has dramatically pedalled back on its publicly declared authorship of pahalgam terror attack.
