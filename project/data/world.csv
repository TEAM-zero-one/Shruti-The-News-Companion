The Indian Embassy in Israel confirmed their recovery and stated, ""While the matter is still under investigation, the Embassy is in touch with the Israeli authorities & have requested to ensure their safety & well-being.""According to the Israeli Population and Immigration Authority, the workers were lured to the West Bank village of al-Zaayem by Palestinians under the false promise of employment. Their passports were confiscated and allegedly used in an attempt to cross into Israel illegally.The rescue operation was carried out overnight by the Israeli Population and Immigration Authority, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), and the Justice Ministry, local media reported. The workers have been moved to a secure location while authorities determine their employment status.The IDF detected the fraudulent use of the Indian passports and returned them to their rightful owners. News outlet Ynetnews reported that Palestinians had used the documents to bypass Israeli checkpoints. Israeli forces later intercepted some suspects at a checkpoint, which led to the workers' recovery.Israel has seen an influx of Indian workers in its construction sector, with around 16,000 arriving in the past year. This recruitment followed Israel’s decision to bar tens of thousands of Palestinian construction workers from entering the country after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack.",The workers were lured to the west bank village of al-zaayem by palestinians under the false promise of employment.

Jungles cleared of Maoists but 'urban Naxals' a threat: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jungles-cleared-of-maoists-but-urban-naxals-a-threat-pm-modi/articleshow/118770357.cms,"PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Decisive government actions have cleared Naxalism from jungles but the threat of urban Naxals is growing and they have ""rapidly infiltrated"" political parties, PM Narendra Modi said on Thursday. The voices and language of urban Naxals are now heard within these parties, indicating their deep-rooted presence, he said.Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade, the PM said as he credited decisive governance, infrastructure expansion and grassroots development for neutralising the insurgency.Warning of the new challenge posed by urban Naxals, the PM said once on the fringes, they are now ""shaping narratives within parties that were once rooted in Gandhian ideology"". ""Their influence threatens both India's development and heritage,"" Modi said at a media event here. He also underscored that the ideological extremism is also gaining ground in intellectual spaces. Highlighting India's remarkable economic strides, Modi said even 65 years after independence, the country was the world's 11th-largest economy, but in the past decade, it has become the fifth-largest economy and is now rapidly moving towards becoming the third-largest economy.He recalled that in 2007, India's GDP reached $1 trillion annually, whereas today, the same amount is generated every quarter, reflecting the nation's accelerating growth. In addition, he said, 25 crore people have been lifted out of poverty and Rs 42 lakh crore has been directly transferred to beneficiaries through DBT, ensuring transparency and eliminating corruption leakages.Modi also detailed India's rise in global industries. ""From importing rifles, we now export defence equipment 20 times more than before. Solar energy capacity has increased 30 times, and toy exports have tripled,"" he said. Infrastructure investment has seen a five-fold boost, doubling the number of airports and tripling the number of AIIMS institutions. The startup ecosystem has flourished, and India now ranks among the top three in the world for new businesses, Modi said.","Naxalism is in its final phase, with affected districts reduced from more than 100 to fewer than 24 in the past decade.

Omar to Centre: Reclaim PoK but also get back areas in Chinese grip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-to-centre-reclaim-pok-but-also-get-back-areas-in-chinese-grip/articleshow/118768785.cms,"Photo/ANI

JAMMU: J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah questioned Thursday the BJP-led Centre’s “silence” on swathes of the region under Chinese control. The National Conference (NC) mascot did so while referring to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s recent statement about reclaiming Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).“The foreign minister has said they will bring back the portion of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan. Did we ever stop them? If they can bring it back, they should do it now. But why no talks on China? Why does the (Union) govt only focus on PoK while ignoring Chinese control over parts of J&K,” the CM said in the assembly during a debate.Jaishankar had made the comments on Wednesday in London in response to a Pakistani scribe’s query, saying the Kashmir issue would be solved when the “stolen part of Kashmir, which is under illegal Pakistani occupation” was returned.Omar pointed out, however, that “one part is with Pakistan, and another is with China”, asking why the Centre didn’t talk about taking back the portions under Beijing’s grip. The CM mentioned further that the Kargil war of 1999 was a good opportunity for the Centre to take back POK, but was missed. “It’s okay that it could not be done then, but if you can reclaim it today, then who among us will say don’t get it back?” Omar asked.Omar came down heavily on BJP leaders for accusing his NC of insulting J&K’s last ruler Maharaja Hari Singh and challenged them to give just one instance when the ruling party or any other Kashmir-based party insulted the Dogra ruler, even as he accused BJP of downgrading the Muslim-majority state.The CM renewed his criticism of the 2019 abrogation of statehood and division into two parts -- J&K and Ladakh. “Maharaja Bahadur (rulers of Princely State) gave you a map of J&K as a legacy. You (the Centre) divided the map of J&K into two parts and now you say this is what the people of Ladakh wanted. Did you ask the people of Ladakh what they wanted?” Omar asked.The CM explained why return of statehood was necessary. “I am not fighting for statehood for myself, this fight is in J&K’s interest. The things we want to do can be given practical shape only when we get back statehood,” Omar said.",J&k chief minister omar abdullah questioned the centre’s ‘silence’ on swathes of the region under chinese control.

Trade deal with India key to Donald Trump's bid to boost exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trade-deal-with-india-key-to-donald-trumps-bid-to-boost-exports/articleshow/118769020.cms,"US President Donald Trump, right, speaks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, Feb 13, 2025, in Washington. (AP)

NEW DELHI: A bilateral trade deal is critical not just for India but also for the US as it is seen to be key to Donald Trump's focus on boosting production and exports from America. An across-the-board duty reduction will mean that carmakers, bourbon producers or handset manufacturers will ship goods into India from the most competitive source, likely to be China or south-east Asia, instead of an American factory.Neither Harley Davidson, a favourite with all American presidents, or Tesla, run by Trump aide Elon Musk, source their vehicles from the US.While Harley is importing its bikes from its manufacturing set-up in Thailand, Tesla, which is close to launching its cars in India, is likely to ship its electrics from Germany after authorities requested the company not to import the vehicles from China.Companies find it beneficial to use other manufacturing bases due to locational advantages helping them save on freight or due to economies of scale. Besides, some are taking advantage of India's existing free trade agreements to ship goods at zero duty.For all the noise, Harley, which only makes the 440cc model in India in partnership with Hero Moto. ""There is a mega set-up in Thailand that the company uses to get its bikes to India. Beyond the 440cc that it makes here, all the other bikes - including bigger ones like Pan America, Nightster, Street Glide and Fat Bob - are being imported from Thailand,"" an analyst specialising in foreign trade told TOI.""So even if India reduces the duty on imported bikes from the US to zero, Harley will still find it beneficial to get them from Thailand due to its proximity to India, which lowers the freight cost and makes shipments faster,"" another analyst said.A bilateral trade deal, for which commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal is in Washington, could provide duty advantages to India as well as the US, and enable factories and farmers in both countries to directly export.Government has signalled its lower tariffs by slashing duties on imported bikes and bourbon. Although the move, which saw reduction from all sources of imports, was addressing Trump's repeated attack on India's ""high tariffs"", it did not result in any gains for factories in the US.Of the $2.6 million import of bourbon whiskey, only $780,000 was directly from the US, and the bulk came from other countries, some of which were bottling hubs.","A bilateral trade deal is seen to be key to donald trump's focus on boosting production and exports from america.

'Frustrated sarfira': Ashok Gehlot slams Mani Shankar Aiyar for remarks against Rajiv Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frustrated-sarfira-ashok-gehlot-slams-mani-shankar-aiyar-for-remarks-against-rajiv-gandhi/articleshow/118765549.cms,"Ashok Gehlot vs Mani Shankar Aiyar over Rajiv Gandhi.

NEW DELHI: Former Rajasthan chief minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot on Thursday called his party colleague Mani Shankar Aiyar a frustrated "" sarfira ."" Reacting strongly to Aiyar's remarks questioning the competency of late Rajiv Gandhi, Gehlot said: ""His statements about Rajiv Gandhi reflect the height of frustration. There is so much frustration in him. In such a situation, a person does not know what he is saying. Only a 'sarfira' can say such a thing about Rajiv Gandhi.""Calling Aiyar's comments condemnable, Gehlot said Rajiv Gandhi increased India's prestige abroad as the Prime Minister and claimed that exemplary laws were passed during his tenure.On Wednesday, Congress leader Harish Rawat had called Aiyar a ""frustrated individual."" ""I don't want to comment on someone who is a frustrated individual...I knew Rajiv Gandhi, who gave the country a modern outlook. He took concrete steps for the liberalisation of the economy as well. Unfortunately, a section of the party (Congress) did not stand with him, or else the country's history would have been something else. His speeches as LoP still guide leaders,"" Rawat had said.Nana Patole, former Maharashtra Congress chief had slammed Aiyar for digging out uncomfortable details about the former PM who left the world long ago. “He has lost his mental balance, he should get himself examined,” Patole had said yesterday.Congress leaders have unleashed an offensive against Aiyar after BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video on his official 'X' handle in which former Union minister is heard questioning former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's education.In the video, Aiyar is heard saying that despite failing at Cambridge, where passing is considered relatively easy, he went on to attend Imperial College London, only to face failure again.Also read: 'How could someone who failed twice become PM?': Mani Shankar Aiyar's shocker on Rajiv Gandhi; Cong calls him 'frustrated leader' ""Rajiv Gandhi struggled academically, even failing at Cambridge, where passing is relatively easy.

Let the veil be stripped"", Amit Malviya captioned his post on 'X.This is not the first time that Aiyar has landed the Congress in trouble with his remarks. There have been several instances in the past when Aiyar has embarrassed the Congress by speaking out of turn. His remarks mocking PM Modi's past as a tea seller in 2014 gave the BJP a weapon to brand Congress as an elitist party. He later made another derogatory remark against the Prime Minister leading to his suspension from the party. However, his recent remarks against the Gandhis don't appear to be unintentional.Aiyar had recently claimed that his career was both made and unmade by the Gandhis. In an interview to news agency PTI, Aiyar had mentioned that aside from one occasion, he had limited meaningful interactions with Rahul Gandhi , and he had only spent time with Priyanka Gandhi on two occasions.“For 10 years, I was not given an opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one. I was not given an opportunity, except once, of spending any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi. And I have not spent time with Priyanka except on one occasion, no, two occasions. She comes on the phone to me, so I’m in touch with them. So, the irony of my life is that my political career was made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" he had said.(With inputs from agencies)","Mani shankar aiyar questioned the competency of late prime minister rajiv gandhi.

'Misuse of democratic freedoms': MEA



The UK on Thursday ""strongly condemned"" the significant security breach of external affairs minister S Jaishankar during his official visit to the United KingdomThe incident occurred outside the Chatham House think-tank in London, where Jaishankar was participating in a discussion. A group of Khalistani extremists staged a protest, chanting slogans and waving flags, which escalated into a direct confrontation with the minister's convoy.As Jaishankar was leaving the venue, a man ran towards his car and tore the Indian national flag in front of London police officers. The act of vandalism was captured on video, showing the protester aggressively rushing towards the minister's vehicle while shouting ""Khalistan Zindabad"". Initially, the police appeared hesitant to intervene, but they eventually took the man and other extremists away.Also read: Khalistani extremists heckle, attempt to attack EAM Jaishankar in London; man tears Indian flag In a statement, the UK foreign office said: ""We strongly condemn the incident that took place outside Chatham House yesterday during the External Affairs Minister's visit to the UK.

NEW DELHI: In a major boost to IAF’s strategic airlift capability to forward areas, a gigantic C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft has for the first time landed at the high-altitude Kargil airfield near the Line of Control with Pakistan.The “trial run” saw the four-engine C-17 take off from its home base at Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi and land at the Kargil airstrip, which is in a bowl surrounded by mountains on all sides and located at an altitude of over 9,700-feet, on Wednesday morning.“The next step will be to conduct a night landing by a C-17 at Kargil. The C-17 can normally airlift a 70-tonne cargo but it’s around 35 tonne at the altitude in Kargil. The much smaller C-130J `Super Hercules' had landed at night in Kargil in Jan last year. The C-17 increases the load carrying capacity by around four times,” a source told TOI .With an eye on both China and Pakistan, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at forward air-bases and advance landing grounds (ALGs), including Thoise, Fukche, Nyoma and Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in Ladakh as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh.The ongoing Rs 230 crore upgrade work at the Nyoma ALG, which is located close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in eastern Ladakh at an altitude of 13,710-feet, for instance, includes extending and strengthening the existing airstrip into a 2.7-km `rigid pavement’ runway for all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft including fighters for “defensive as well as offensive operations”, as was earlier reported by TOI.The IAF has inducted 11 C-17s for $4.5 billion and 13 C-130Js for $2.1 billion from the US over the last 15 years to augment its airlift capabilities. One C-130J was lost in a crash near Gwalior in March 2014, which killed the five personnel on board.The rugged C-17s and C-130s, which can even land at makeshift airstrips, have been extensively used to airlift supplies and troops to border areas with China and Pakistan, evacuation of Indian nationals from abroad, and providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief in India and overseas.In Aug 2013, for instance, a C-130J had for the first time landed at the rudimentary airstrip in DBO at an altitude of 16,614-feet, the highest such ALG in the world that overlooks the strategic Karakoram Pass and is just a few kms from the LAC with China.",C-17 aircraft lands at kargil in a major boost to strategic airlift capabilities.

CHENNAI: Madras HC Thursday directed Union government to unblock Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan 's website, which had been blocked after it published online an offensive cartoon showing PM Narendra Modi.The cartoon was published during Modi's visit to the US and his summit meeting with US President Donald Trump, and coincided with illegal immigrants from India being deported from the US.Justice D Bharatha Chakravarthy granted the interim relief to the magazine with a rider that the cartoon should be removed. Since only the caricature in question appears to be objectionable, the rest of the magazine can remain accessible, the court said.The court's order came on a plea moved by the magazine challenging Centre's action of blocking access to its website. The magazine's counsel, Vijay Narayan, submitted that the website was blocked without giving a proper opportunity to respond to the allegation. Narayan argued that as per Section 69A of Information Technology Act , it will not be sufficient to block access to a website merely because sovereignty is affected; it is also necessary that the integrity of the country is compromised. ""The cartoon published by the magazine did not fall under any of the reasons cited under the law for blocking public access to information,"" he added.No damage was caused to the sovereignty and integrity of the country, and no harm befell the friendly relations between India and the US due to the publication of the cartoon, Narayan said.Opposing the plea, additional solicitor-general of India A R L Sundaresan said the cartoon would affect India's relations with the US. ""Article 19(2) of the Constitution and Section 69A of the IT Act provide for reasonable restriction on content if it is satisfied that such restriction is necessary in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,"" he said.",Madras hc thursday directed union government to unblock tamil journal ananda vikatan's website.

NEW DELHI: 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana on Thursday made another last ditch effort to avoid extradition to India, alleging 'torture' in India.He approached the US Supreme Court , seeking an emergency stay on his previously allowed extradition. In the appeal application, Rana contended that his survival chances would be insufficient for facing trial in India, citing multiple factors. His petition specifically mentioned that ""if a stay is not entered, there will be no review at all, and the US courts will lose jurisdiction, and the petitioner will soon be dead.""Also read: Delhi court seeks 26/11 trial papers from Mumbai court ahead of Tahawwur Hussain Rana extradition The 26/11 terror attacks suspect alleged that his extradition to India would likely lead to his torture, given his status as a Pakistani-origin Muslim individual.This comes as Rana's extradition was greenlit by US President Donald Trump last month. During a joint press conference at the White House with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump had announced the decision and suggested additional extraditions would follow. ""We are giving a very violent man (Tahawwur Rana) back to India immediately. There are more to follow because we have quite a few requests. We work with India on crime, and we want to make things better for India,"" Trump had said whilst acknowledging the ongoing collaboration between both nations regarding criminal matters.Prior to Trump's approval, US Supreme Court had rejected Rana’s appeal on January 21 which was over a ruling by a lower court which also gave it ruling, allowing Ran's extradition to India where he is wanted in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists.Rana, who holds Canadian citizenship and has Pakistani origins, faces charges in India for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks that resulted in over 174 fatalities. He was found guilty in the United States for providing support to the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). India has been seeking his extradition for an extended period.In connection with the 26/11 attack, Rana is alleged to have assisted his associate David Coleman Headley, also known as Daood Gilani, who possessed US citizenship through his American mother and Pakistani father. US authorities apprehended Headley in October 2009.Rana's involvement reportedly extended beyond being cognisant of Headley's connections to LeT, the Pakistan-based outlawed terrorist group. He actively supported Headley by providing him with false credentials, which enabled Headley to travel to India and scout potential targets for LeT's 2008 operation.","26/11 accused tahawwur rana on thursday made another last ditch effort to avoid extradition to india, alleging 'torture' in india.

India's position always has been that Pakistan is in illegal occupation of approximately 78,000 sq km of Indian territory in J&K.""On Kashmir, actually we have done, I think, a good job solving most of it. Removing Article 370 was step number one, restoring growth and economic activity and social justice in Kashmir was step number two, and holding elections with a very high turnout was step number three,"" said Jaishankar, responding to a question during a discussion at Chatham House, an international affairs think tank.""I think the part we are waiting for is the return of the stolen part of Kashmir, which is under illegal Pakistani occupation; when that is done, I assure you Kashmir will be solved,"" he added.India's position, as also enunciated in the 1994 Parliament resolution adopted unanimously, is that the entire UTs of J&K and Ladakh have been, are and shall be an integral part of India. It has regularly called upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal and forcible occupation.In Islamabad, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan rejected Jaishankar's remarks.","India's foreign minister s jaishankar says if pakistan returns the ""stolen part"" of kashmir to india, the matter would be fully resolved.

Trump’s America First policy suits India as it is leading to multipolar world: EAM S Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trumps-america-first-policy-suits-india-as-it-is-leading-to-multipolar-world-eam-s-jaishankar/articleshow/118768782.cms,"Photo credit: X/@DrSJaishankar

TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM LONDON: The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, which suits New Delhi very well, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said at Chatham House here.“If I were to look at the big priorities of this president, many of them work for us,” he said. “He seems to be committed to keeping energy prices reasonably affordable and stable — we welcome that. He is putting a lot of emphasis on tech and on the use of tech as a game changer in global politics. That offers a lot of possibilities for us. When I look at our interests and our expectations of the relationship, there is a lot of promise. We see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits India,” he said.“Just because there is multipolarity, it doesn’t have to translate into currency multipolarity,” he explained. “There is no policy on our part to replace the dollar,” he stressed. “The dollar, as the reserve currency, is the source of international economic stability and we want more economic stability, not less. The assumption that, somehow, there is a united BRICS position against the dollar is not borne out by facts,” he said. “We have no interest in undermining the dollar. On the contrary, a lot of problems in our region are due to the lack of availability of the dollar,” he said.“Since 1945, one tends to think and talk about the USA as ‘USA and the Western world’ so it’s more like a bloc rather than a nation. What is quite clear is that the US’s own self-perception is now more as a nation; and perhaps a little less as a bloc.” India has spent the past decade developing relations with big players, and non-big ones, he said. “If we can do that successfully with all major powers and groupings, that puts you in a much better position in a world which we could see was heading towards multipolarity,” he said, adding that both India and the Global South would benefit from this new world.Jaishankar also defended India’s human rights record from foreign press criticism. “We have been, for political reasons, at the receiving end of a lot of expressions and sometimes even campaigns on human rights. We listen to it. We are not perfect, but I would argue if one looks around the world, we have a very strong human rights record.“As a credible democracy where people have growing faith in that democracy, where representation has broadened in every conceivable way, where the state has been very fair in terms of treatment of its citizens, I think any sweeping concern on human rights is misplaced.”He also batted back against a question from Bronwen Maddox, chief executive of Chatham House, referring to British media and “parts of UK govt” claiming that minorities such as Tamils, Sikhs and Muslims do not feel as comfortable in India. “I am a Tamil and I feel perfectly comfortable,” he said.“There is a certain politics prevalent in some parts of the world, very driven by a kind of vote bank consideration, driven by creating identity lobbies, actually pandering to them and stoking a certain attitude, and we don’t think that is a very healthy politics,” he said.“That kind of tokenism is very disruptive politics and so I would dispute the idea that that is an ideal to which we should all aspire. That is a model which we reject. Good politics is about treating your citizens equally,” he added.","The world is becoming increasingly multipolar with different centres of power, s jaishankar said. “we see a president and an administration moving towards multipolarity and that is something which suits india,” he said.

Green card backlog

HYDERABAD: Close to one lakh Indian youth in the US, turning 21 this year, are burdened by the same question: What next? While the US policy, up until now, allowed these H4 visa holders — dependants of NRIs parents-time to opt to convert their visa status to to a student visa if they wish to pursue education, or an employment visa if they seek work with sponsorship from their employer, recent changes in other immigration polices and debate related to Indians in the US have left them worried.Their fear: Being forced to 'self deport' to India — a country they are barely familiar with — or living as ‘outsiders’ in the US.With them turning 21 soon, the Indian youth fear they might be staring at uncertainty. Also, because their parents — who migrated to the US with the kids were minors — are all H-1B holders with a waiting period of between 12 and 100 years for a green card.“I have lived here since I was six. My education, friends, and my future are here. But now, I am being told that I might have to leave the only country I have ever known,” said a 20-year-old nursing student from California, whose dependent H-4 visa expires in Aug. Although she is eligible for an F-1 (student) visa to continue her education, the process comes with its own set of challenges — of being branded as international students. “This will not only make us ineligible for in-state tuition fees, federal financial aid, or scholarships, but also put a huge financial burden on our families, many of whom are already struggling with the high cost of living in the US,” she said.Another 20-year-old from Texas, whose H-4 visa will expire by the end of this year, said, “I can't afford out-of-state tuition and can't work off-campus to support myself. It feels like I'm being punished for something I had no control over. I will have to pay fees as high as $45,000 (Rs 39.2 lakh) compared to $10,000 (Rs 8.7 lakh) that my friends here pay.”Some of these youth are also considering moving to other countries like Canada or the UK, where immigration policies are seen as more inclusive. “It might be an easier option. Even if I stay and study here, I don’t know what my prospects are of getting a job and securing my future. My parents are planning to return to India after retirement, so I have nothing to stay back for,” said a Memphis-based undergraduate student who will be turning 21 in April. He added: “I can't see myself moving back to India as it seems like just another foreign land to me. I left when I was child. I would have to start afresh.”The massive backlog in the US employment-based green card system, which disproportionately affects Indian immigrants, is a serious concern among this section of youth. According to data from March 2023, nearly 1.34 lakh Indian children were expected to age out of dependent visa status before their families obtained green cards. “Our waiting period is 23 years, and I am turning 21 this October. What am I supposed to do after that?,” said a Texas-based student.","Close to one lakh indian youth in the us, turning 21 this year, are burdened by the same question: what next?

Love at Second Sight: Anastasia Shubskaya and Alexander Ovechkin's Love Story

A Growing Family: Ovechkin and Anastasia 's Children

When we talk about Alexander Ovechkin , it's usually about his blistering slap shots and record-breaking goals, but let’s switch gears and shine the spotlight on the woman behind the hockey legend — Anastasia Shubskaya , or as she’s known now, Nastasiya Ovechkina. So, who is the powerhouse supporting Ovi off the ice? Let’s break it down.Born on November 16, 1993, in Switzerland, Anastasia Shubskaya is the daughter of Kirill Shubsky, a prominent Russian businessman, and Vera Glagoleva, a celebrated Russian actress and film director. Though she spent part of her childhood in Switzerland, her roots firmly planted themselves in Russia, where she grew up alongside her sisters, Anna and Maria.Tragically, Anastasia lost her mother to cancer in 2017, a heartbreak that further fueled her passion for cinema — a world her mother so deeply influenced.Anastasia isn’t just known for being Ovechkin’s wife — she’s carved out her own path in the world of modeling, acting, and film production. She graduated from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in 2014 and later pursued an acting program at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles.Her modeling career took off in Russia, with appearances in various high-end magazines, and she continues to be a familiar face both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, blending beauty with brains and creativity.Their love story is straight out of a rom-com. Anastasia and Alexander first crossed paths at the 2008 Beijing Olympics but didn't start dating until 2014 — thanks to a little social media magic. A few DMs and heart-fluttering conversations later, the pair reconnected and didn’t look back.Fast forward to July 2016, and the couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony, only to follow it up with a lavish celebration in July 2017 at the Barvikha Luxury Village near Moscow. Talk about a fairytale wedding!Family means everything to the Ovechkins. The couple are proud parents to two adorable sons — Sergei Aleksandrovich Ovechkin (born August 2018) and Ilya Aleksandrovich Ovechkin (born May 2020). Their first son was named in honor of Alexander's late brother, adding a heartfelt layer to their family story.While Anastasia is often recognized as the wife of one of the NHL's greatest players, she’s more than just a hockey wife — she’s a model, actress, and loving mother, all while supporting Alexander as he chases hockey history.So next time Ovi lights up the scoreboard, just remember — there's an equally impressive force cheering him on from the stands.Also read - Can Alex Ovechkin Overtake Wayne Gretzky's Goal Record With 20 Games Left in the NHL Season?","Anastasia shubskaya is the wife of nhl star alexander ovechkin.

Cyclone Alfred’s unusual path baffles experts: Why forecasters are concerned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/cyclone-alfreds-unusual-path-baffles-experts-why-forecasters-are-concerned/articleshow/118742988.cms,"What’s making Cyclone Alfred unusual?

Why are forecasters concerned?

The bigger picture: Is climate change a factor?

As Cyclone Alfred closes in on Australia’s eastern coast, meteorologists are grappling with its unpredictable movement, unusually strong intensity, and potential for widespread destruction. Unlike most tropical cyclones that veer away from Australia’s coastline, Alfred has taken a rare westward turn, putting densely populated areas at risk.1. A rare westward turn toward landMost cyclones in the Coral Sea move southeastward, following prevailing mid-latitude westerly winds that steer them away from land. However, Alfred has defied this norm. Initially drifting southward parallel to the Australian coastline, it took a sudden westward turn toward Queensland and New South Wales.Dr Liz Ritchie-Tyo, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Monash University, was quoted by the Independent as explaining, “This shift is due to Alfred’s interaction with a mid-latitude trough. Instead of weakening and drifting away, it has re-intensified into a hybrid system, sometimes even stronger than the original tropical cyclone.”2. Strength sustained further south than expectedTropical cyclones typically weaken as they move south due to cooler ocean temperatures and stronger wind shear, which disrupts their structure. However, Alfred has maintained its strength as a Category 2 system and could even brush close to Category 3 intensity before landfall.“The last time a severe tropical cyclone made landfall this far south was in the 1950s,” said Dr Tom Mortlock of Climate Analytics Asia-Pacific, as quoted by the Independent. “We’re seeing storms sustain their intensity much further south than before, and that’s alarming.”One key factor is ocean temperatures. The sea surface near Sydney is currently around 27°C—about 1°C above average. Warm waters above 26.5°C are essential for cyclone development, and Alfred is feeding off this energy.3. Intensification and unpredictabilityScientists have noted that Alfred formed alongside two other tropical systems in late February, a rare phenomenon in the South Pacific. While cyclones forming in clusters aren’t unheard of, Alfred’s ability to sustain itself and intensify over an extended period has raised eyebrows.“This is a storm that refuses to weaken,” said meteorologist Thomas Hinterdorfer. “The longer it stays over warm waters, the more energy it gains before landfall.”1. Extreme rainfall and flooding risksCyclone Alfred is expected to bring up to 600mm of rain—enough to overwhelm rivers and trigger widespread flooding across Queensland and northern NSW. With Brisbane and Gold Coast in the storm’s path, authorities are bracing for a major flood event not seen since Cyclone Wanda in 1974.2. Coastal erosion and storm surgesWith high tides coinciding with Alfred’s landfall, coastal communities could see severe erosion and storm surges. The combination of heavy rainfall and strong onshore winds will push seawater inland, increasing flood risks.3. Slow movement could amplify damageThe cyclone is currently moving at just 14 km/h—slower than the average tropical cyclone speed of 15-20 km/h. Slower-moving storms tend to cause prolonged destruction, dumping heavy rainfall over the same area for an extended period.“When cyclones move slowly, they linger over land, causing greater wind damage and prolonged flooding,” said Hinterdorfer. “We saw this with Hurricane Harvey in the U.S., where slow movement led to record-breaking rainfall.”Scientists warn that climate change is altering cyclone behavior, making storms more intense, more frequent, and less predictable. Rising global temperatures are warming ocean waters, fueling stronger cyclones that reach further south than before.“Tropical cyclones used to weaken before reaching Brisbane. That’s no longer guaranteed,” said Dr. Iftekhar Ahmed of the University of Newcastle. “We need to start planning for a future where these types of storms become more common.”With Alfred set to make landfall within hours, authorities are urging residents to prepare for severe weather conditions that could rival the most destructive storms in Australia’s history.","Cyclone alfred has taken a rare westward turn toward land.

Winnie Harlow: My Engagement Story (Full Episode)

Milwaukee Bucks starhas recently reacted to his fiancéeas she details the 29-year-old forward’s proposal in a recent interview. Recently, Kuzma took a significant step in his relationship, proposing to longtime girlfriend Winnie Harlow in a beautifully orchestrated moment that left the model in tears. The couple, who have been dating since 2020, shared their engagement story, revealing the intimate details of Kuzma’s grand yet heartfelt gesture.During her guest appearance on Call Her Daddy, model and entrepreneur Winnie Harlow shared the story behind her engagement to NBA star Kyle Kuzma . Before the episode aired, the podcast released a teaser where she hinted at the special moment. Kuzma later reacted to the clip on his Instagram story, playfully teasing the reveal with a laughing emoji and writing, “Can’t wait to watch it,” while tagging his fiancée.Speaking on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast, Harlow confessed, “I was the last one to know about it. Everyone on my whole team was like, ‘Did you not realize that we’ve been avoiding you for the last two weeks?’”The surprise began before they even reached their destination. Kuzma had rented a private jet and decorated it lavishly with roses, chocolates, balloons, and champagne, setting the tone for a magical moment. “I was the last one to know about it,” she said of the proposal. ""Everyone on my whole team was like, ‘Did you not realize that we’ve been avoiding you for the last two weeks?’ I was like, ‘Well, I was none the wiser,’” Harlow added.As they boarded the decorated jet, Harlow was already moved to tears. But the real surprise came when Kuzma pulled out a heartfelt poem he had written for her. The model had once jokingly asked Kuzma to send her a love letter, not realizing he would turn it into one of the most meaningful moments of their relationship.“I was like, ‘Write me a love letter, my sergeant. Send me a love letter,’ and it was just a joke, you know, but he took that and wrote me a love letter to propose,” Harlow shared. At the end of the poem, instead of the expected question, “Will you be my Valentine?” Kuzma instead asked, “Will you be my wife?”“I literally just went into shock,” she admitted. “I was already crying and just flooded with tears at that point. He pulled out the box, got on one knee, and I was like, ‘Yes. I don’t even need to see it … Yes, yes, yes.’”Kuzma had been planning the proposal for six months. He even arranged for Harlow’s nail technician to fly from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to make sure she had her nails done before the big moment. The centerpiece of the proposal was an 8.5-carat oval-cut diamond ring, which Kuzma spent three months designing. “I just wanted to draw a picture of what I felt resembled her—something that was elegant, but very timeless and simplistic at the same time,” he told Vogue.Initially, Kuzma had planned to propose in Turks and Caicos with both of their families present, but at the last moment, he decided to keep it intimate and pop the question on the plane. “I love that he did that. It was so beautiful, so romantic, it was just him and I,” Harlow said.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo gives honest reaction after joining elite 20,000 points club Harlow and Kuzma’s love story began in 2020, but it almost didn’t happen.

: Citing possible torture and execution by Indian authorities, Tahawwur Rana, a former Pakistani Army veteran involved in the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, has filed an emergency appeal before the US Supreme Court seeking a stay on his extradition to India, even as Islamabad handed over to the US another terrorist wanted by Washington.Seeking an emergency stay of his imminent extradition already announced by President Trump during Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Washington, Rana's attorneys on Wednesday cited a UK case (Sanjay Bhandari v Government of India) in which a London court denied extradition on similar grounds, because there was ""a real risk of his being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""Also read: 'Will soon be dead': 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana tells US court he'll be tortured if extradited to India The US Supreme Court had previously rejected on January 21 Rana's review petition to stay the extradition, but his attorneys returned to the apex court this week to file a last-ditch emergency appeal arguing that if extradited to India, he faces a high likelihood of torture due to his identity as a Muslim of Pakistani origin, his former status as a Pakistani Army member, and his chronic health conditions.""Rana now faces the prospect of transfer to a country where his birthplace (Pakistan), his religion (Muslim), and the nature of the charges (terrorist murder of 166 people) mark him for likely abuse--followed, if he survives pretrial incarceration, by a trial with a predictable result and execution by hanging, per India Code of Criminal Procedure § 354(5),"" his attorneys said.In a supplement to the emergency application for stay before SC Associate Justice Elena Kagan, they appended the UK case reference where Sanjay Bhandari won reprieve to face charges of money laundering and tax evasion, although Rana faces terrorism-related charges.""The Bhandari decision demonstrates that petitioner’s fears of being subjected to torture, likely to result in death, are well-founded as evidenced by the U.K. courts’ refusal to extradite to India an individual charged merely with financial crimes unaccompanied by any high-profile, overarching religious, ethnic, or national considerations that would make the individual a particular focus of scorn or animus,"" Rana's attorneys argued.The Supreme Court has taken this application on record, but a hearing date is yet to be set, delaying an extradition that Trump himself confirmed on February 13 at a joint press conference with Modi. The case has now dragged on for almost four years with the accused delaying his extradition with legal stratagems that would have cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars.The latest ploy came hours after Pakistan extradited to the US Mohammed Shareefullah, an alleged terrorist the Trump administration said is wanted in the Abbey Gate attack in Kabul which killed 13 American personnel and 170 Afghans.While Trump himself mentioned the handover in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday -- saying ""he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” -- to highlight his administration's resolve, a former CIA officer claimed Shareefullah had nothing to do with the Abbey Gate attack, which she said was masterminded by Sirajuddin Haqqani and Sanaullah Ghafari.""So why was a fake mastermind detained and extradited to the U.S.—and who is telling our American President@realdonaldtrump it was someone else?"" Sarah Adams, a self-described CIA alum who tracks terrorism issues in the region asked in post on X. Indian sources believe Pakistan is trying to delay the extradition of one of its military alums given the precedent it would set, by throwing Shareefullah under the bus.In a Fox News interview, CIA Director John Ratcliff, a Trump loyalist, revealed that was on the phone on his second day in office with his ISI counterpart to underscore the need for cooperation on the issue of terrorism. Ratcliffe himself -- accompanied by FBI Director Kash Patel and DNI chief Tulsi Gabbardm went to the airport to oversee the Shareefullah handover.Soon after Shareefullah's extradition, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump ""for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region, in the context of Pakistan Security Forces’ recent apprehension of ISKP’s top tier operational commander Shareefullah, who is an Afghanistan National.""""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country. We remain steadfast in our resolve and unwavering commitment to combating terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.Such commitment evidently does not extend to India.",Tahawwur rana is a former pakistani army veteran involved in the 26/11 terror attack on mumbai.

How did the clash unfold?



What’s happening now?



Assad’s fall and its aftermath



More than 70 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday in violent clashes between Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad in the coastal province of Latakia, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).""More than 70 killed and dozens wounded and captured in bloody clashes and ambushes on the Syrian coast between members of the Ministry of Defence and Interior and militants from the defunct regime's army,"" the monitor said in a post on X.The violence erupted in Jableh, a town in Latakia province, as security forces launched operations to root out Assad loyalists who have regrouped in the mountainous coastal region.Earlier reports had put the death toll at 48, with SOHR describing the fighting as the ""most violent"" since Assad was ousted by Islamist rebels in December. The dead included 16 security personnel and 28 pro-Assad fighters, while others were wounded or captured.The clashes reportedly began when gunmen linked to an Assad-era commander, Suhail al-Hassan , attacked security patrols and checkpoints. In response, government forces launched helicopter strikes on a village in Latakia.“The armed groups that our security forces were clashing with in the Latakia countryside were affiliated with the war criminal Suhail al-Hassan, who committed the most heinous massacres against the Syrian people,” Latakia's security director Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kunaifati told state news agency SANA.Al-Hassan, nicknamed “The Tiger”, was a key military commander under Assad, leading special forces in major battles against the rebels in 2015. His hometown, Beit Ana, became a focal point of the latest tensions after residents reportedly disrupted security forces during an operation to arrest an arms dealer.Security forces have been deployed in and around Jableh to restore order. Reports indicate that Alawite community leaders have accused the government of targeting peaceful protesters in the helicopter strikes. The Alawites, Assad’s sectarian base, largely backed him during his rule but are now caught in the turmoil following his downfall.SANA, citing defence ministry sources, confirmed that reinforcements have been sent to the Jableh region to bring the situation under control.The latest violence is part of Syria’s ongoing instability following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024. His ouster, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels, marked the end of his 24-year rule and the Assad family’s five-decade hold on power.In the final hours before Damascus fell to the rebels, Assad fled the country in secrecy, misleading his aides about Russian military support.""He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming,"" said Hadi al-Bahra, the head of Syria’s main opposition abroad. ""He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative.""As his government collapsed, security forces abandoned their posts, allowing rebels to seize control of Damascus. Assad’s brother Maher and other key regime figures also fled, while some were ambushed by rebel fighters.Since Assad’s departure, the HTS-led insurgents have promised an inclusive government, but concerns remain over their Islamist ties.","Violence erupted in jableh, a town in latakia province.
