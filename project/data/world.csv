""Don't Want To Be Dependent On US Or China…"" Macron On AI Innovation

Human capital development critical to realise AI's potential

: The AI Impact Summit concluded here with the adoption of the New Delhi Declaration marking the success of the push by India and other countries in the Global South to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good rather than an exclusive technological advantage of the rich and developed.Endorsed by 86 countries and two organisations, the declaration sets out a shared global vision for what it calls ""collaborative, trusted, resilient and efficient"" artificial intelligence, whose potential can be realised ""only when its benefits are shared by humanity"" and cautioning that ""the choices that we make today will shape the AI-enabled world that future generations will inherit"".Signatories span the AI powerhouses of the US and China as well as other technology leaders such as Netherlands, South Korea and the EU.Significantly, Pakistan does not figure in the list.Taiwan, the leading semiconductor manufacturer, appeared to have been left out because of sensitivities of China, which has blocked its presence on international fora.Rooted in the principle of ""Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya"" - welfare and happiness for all - a theme PM Modi articulated in his inaugural address on Thursday, the declaration places equity and access at the centre of AI governance, and commits participants to ""foster shared understanding, while respecting national sovereignty, on how AI could be made to serve humanity"".For many developing countries, this emphasis addresses long-standing concerns about technology rules being shaped without their participation.The declaration is organised around seven action pillars, or chakras, covering democratising AI resources; economic growth and social good; secure and trusted AI; AI for science; access for social empowerment; human capital development; and resilient, efficient and innovative AI systems. Together, they aim to translate broad principles into coordinated global action.Several voluntary commitments were announced to support this effort. Among them is the Global AI Impact Commons, described as ""a practical platform to encourage and enable the adoption, replication, and scale-up of successful AI use cases across regions"".The idea is to allow countries to share proven applications in areas such as public services, development and governance, reducing duplication and accelerating impact.Trust and safety form another core strand, with the declaration stressing that ""advancing secure, trustworthy and robust AI is foundational to building trust and maximising societal and economic benefits"". To support this, it takes note of the Trusted AI Commons - a voluntary repository of tools, benchmarks and best practices aimed at helping govts and developers build reliable AI systems across different legal, cultural contexts.With concern for democratisation of AI being one of the drivers of the declaration, it, predictably, emphasises that ""removing structural barriers to and increasing availability of AI research infrastructure can promote the use of AI in scientific research and development across countries"".An international network of AI-for-science institutions is expected to link researchers globally and accelerate AI-driven discovery. Human capital development is highlighted as critical to realising AI's potential.The declaration underlines that ""realising the full promise of AI requires equipping individuals with relevant skills"", backing this with voluntary guiding principles for reskilling and a workforce development playbook.","The new delhi declaration marks the success of the push by india and other countries in the global south to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good.

NEW DELHI: An agreement for cooperation on rare earths and critical minerals, bilateral trade target of $ 30 billion by 2030 and Global South solidarity in technology that, according to PM Narendra Modi, must be inclusive and act as a bridge for shared progress were among the highlights of Modi’s bilateral meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Modi said that the critical minerals agreement, which could potentially lower dependence on China, was a major step towards building resilient supply chains. Significantly, the leaders discussed the US Supreme Court judgment striking down President Donald Trump’s global tariffs and agreed that both sides needed to study its implications.“So, we will essentially be in a wait and watch mode to see how the administration responds to this judgment, whether any further steps are taken and to study the implications for our trade,” said MEA secretary (east) P Kumaran at a media briefing.Lula mentioned trade unilateralism in his remarks and also said that in a turbulent world, both sides were required to strengthen and deepen their strategic dialogue. “India and Brazil are crucial voices at the UN, at the WTO and G20,” said the president, while also underlining the significance of BRICS cooperation.Modi and Lula focused on energy transition, and defence and security cooperation that the PM said was a perfect example of mutual trust and strategic harmony.“We will continue to strengthen this win-win partnership further,” said the PM in his media remarks. In all, India and Brazil signed 9 agreements, including one in the field of mining for steel supply chain, and also announced that Brazil will extend business visas for Indian ordinary passport holders to 10 years.Modi said that the expansion of India’s trade agreement with Mercosur (a South American trading bloc) will further strengthen economic cooperation and that bilateral cooperation in the field of technology and innovation is important to both countries as well as the entire global south. We are also prioritising our cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, supercomputers, semiconductors, and blockchain,” said Modi, adding that energy cooperation too has been a strong pillar of the relationship and there’s now increasing cooperation in renewable energy, ethanol blending and sustainable aviation fuel.“As democratic countries, we will continue to advance the priorities and aspirations of the Global South. When India and Brazil work together the voice of the Global South becomes stronger and more confident,” said the PM. Lula said in his remarks that this was a meeting of a a digital superpower with a renewable energy superpower.Brazil joined India in strongly condemning cross-border terrorism, along with the Pahalgam terrorist attack and the Red Fort “terror incident”. According to a joint statement, the leaders reaffirmed defence as an integral pillar of the India-Brazil Strategic Partnership and underscored the potential for co-design and co-production by linking India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat with Brazil’s defense industrial base.As expected, there was a strong focus on UN reforms, particularly the Security Council (UNSC), including its expansion in both permanent and non-permanent membership categories, for which both countries have been working under the G4 framework that also includes Japan and Germany. The joint statement said that the leaders reaffirmed their commitment for mutual support for the permanent membership of their countries in an expanded UNSC and India welcomed Brazil’s support to India’s candidature for a non-permanent UNSC seat for the term 2028-29.Kumaran said that on critical minerals, Lula gave a detailed presentation on Brazil's substantial critical minerals and rare earth reserves. “He said only 30% of their reserves have been explored and that there is substantial scope for exploration, processing minerals and also using them. He said Brazil would value India's partnership. So, we will be taking this forward,” said the official.","India, brazil sign rare earths deal; modi calls it 'major step' towards supply chain resilience.

NEW DELHI: Opposition leaders and Congress allies on Saturday criticised the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) over its ""semi-nude"" protest at the AI Impact Summit, calling the act ""inappropriate"" and saying it brought shame to the country on an international platform.Speaking to reporters, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""... We may have internal rifts, but what Congress did on the global platform was not appropriate.""""They should have refrained from doing something that brings shame to our country in front of foreign delegates and world representatives..."" he added.These remarks come after around 10 IYC workers were detained on Friday after they briefly raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi inside Exhibition Hall No. 5 at Bharat Mandapam during the summit, triggering a political storm.The protesters had entered the venue wearing or holding white T-shirts bearing images of PM Modi and US President Donald Trump, along with slogans such as ""India-US Trade Deal"", ""Epstein Files"" and ""PM is compromised,"" leading to heated exchanges with attendees.YSR Congress chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote on X, ""Yesterday at the AI Summit, the Youth Congress made us all feel ashamed.Where is our politics heading! No one should ever demean our country.""""Whatever our political differences may be, we should always present a united face to the world,"" he added.BSP president Mayawati also expressed the same sentiment saying that at an internationally significant event like the 'AI Impact Summit', ""any expression of anger through semi-nudity by those who did so during this event—most of whom are said to be young Congress members—is utterly unbecoming and reprehensible.""""Had this conference not been of international stature, it would have been a different matter altogether; however, such conduct during the summit is a cause for concern, meaning it would be fitting not to tarnish the dignity and image of our country,"" she posted on X.RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha said while grievances may exist, the manner of protest could have been better.""I said this yesterday, and I’m saying it again today: grievances exist, and no one can deny that. Whether it’s about the lack of clarity in a deal or issues with Epstein files, there could have been a better way to address these concerns. In my view, the Youth Congress acted, but personally, as I see it, any movement needs to be handled responsibly,"" he said.""In the past, BJP members have done similar things, but that doesn’t make it right for anyone. The point is, grievances exist, people especially a section of farmers are worried, and there could have been a better option for how and where these concerns were expressed,"" he added.The ruling BJP had on Friday slammed the Congress and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi over the shirtless protest, calling it a ""despicable act.""BJP MP Sambit Patra said, ""Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party are traitors of the highest order.

Congress doesn't have that much wisdom that this AI summit that is going on is not a BJP summit. This is an AI summit of the entire world,"" he added.Later in a statement, the Indian Youth Congress defended its action, saying its workers were protesting against a ""compromised Prime Minister who has traded the identity of the country at the AI Summit.""""That is why the fearless workers of the Indian Youth Congress arrived at Bharat Mandapam.. so that a voice can be raised against the ‘Compromised PM’ and the Modi government is forced to answer for the compromises being made on the country's honour!"" it added.","Bjp calls cong 'topless, brainless, shameless' opposition leaders and congress allies on saturday criticised the indian youth congress (iyc) over its ""semi-nude"" protest at the ai impact summit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128647859,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-64654,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document.

Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive. He urged countries to prepare, protect, and invest in people, noting that international cooperation is currently strained by declining trust and rising technological rivalry.

During his visit, Guterres also highlighted India's initiatives to expand clean energy access and appreciated the country's leadership in convening the AI Impact Summit, as well as its longstanding collaboration with the United Nations across sectors.

At Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu welcomed Guterres’ proposal to establish a global scientific panel on artificial intelligence to serve all of humanity, according to an official release. She reaffirmed India’s commitment to multilateralism at a time when global uncertainties are placing the system under strain.

The President observed that multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations Security Council, must undergo urgent reform to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. She stressed that the existing framework of the Security Council is outdated and that the Global South must be given a greater voice in global decision-making. Reform, she said, is key to preserving the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations.

While acknowledging that the UN-80 initiative offers a useful platform for reform, President Murmu emphasised that any restructuring exercise must safeguard the developmental priorities of the Global South.

She concluded the meeting by extending her good wishes to Guterres for the remainder of his tenure and reiterating India’s full support for multilateralism and international cooperation.","Un chief antonio guterres meets president murmu, says india is proving clean energy growth possible.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday hailed US Supreme Court's ruling on President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on different countries and said that the verdict shows that ""American system of checks and balances still seems to be working. ""Hours after the US Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 verdict invalidating tariffs imposed by Trump, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""Hats off to the US Supreme Court for striking down President Trump’s entire tariff strategy! Quite an amazing decision given its ideological composition.

An Indian team is now in the U.S. to finalise the text of the Framework Agreement. What will the team do now?""

India AI Impact Summit 2026: DGIS Harsh Chhibber Stresses Role Of Sovereign AI In Defence

Despite differences, summit has set stage for cooperation: Indian officials

New Delhi: After a week of packed halls, high-level diplomacy and billion-dollar pitches, several national delegations at the India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday, a day later than planned, as the govt works to widen global consensus on the document.The declaration, already backed by over 70 countries, comes amid companies committing to invest more than $250 billion in the country and reinforced India's push to shape global AI agenda for the Global South. Union minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday there was ""huge consensus"", with discussions continuing. ""The declaration and its contours will be shared transparently tomorrow,"" he said, adding that India hoped the final signatory count would cross 80.Countries had failed to reach a consensus at the last summit in Paris but there appears to be greater synergy on several issues, among govts and companies.Substantive disagreements also surfaced on global governance. While the UN announced formation of an independent scientific panel on AI, the US delegation warned against centralised global control of generative AI, underlining the difficulty of forging binding global rules.Despite differing views, Indian officials said the summit had laid the groundwork for collaboration rather than confrontation. ""This is about real action, not just paper,"" Vaishnaw said, pointing to bilateral discussions, industry commitments and plans for an expanded AI Mission 2.0.Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scale and diversity of participation underlined global confidence in India's approach. ""World has confidence in India's role in the new AI age. That is very important for all of us,"" he said.According to the minister, over five lakh visitors have attended the summit and the expo, with ""practically every major AI player in the world"" participating.A key highlight, Vaishnaw said, was the acceptance of PM Modi's vision of ""ManavAI"" - AI of the humans, by the humans, for the humans - which places responsible and ethical use of AI at the centre. ""For the first time, discussion on ethical and responsible AI has been brought to the forefront in such a meaningful way,"" he said.Investment commitments also featured prominently. Vaishnaw said infrastructure-related pledges linked to AI, data centres and allied technologies had already crossed $250 billion, while around $20 billion in deep-tech venture investments had been completed. ""Numbers are important, but what is more important is the trust the world has shown in India,"" he said.","India ai impact summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence saturday.

He described ""democratic AI"" as systems that are ""open, transparent, follow the rule of law"" and function as ""a tool for an individual to scale their capabilities, to learn, think, build, create, produce."" In contrast, AI developed in ""autocratic systems"" is ""designed to enhance the central authority, the authoritarian govt,"" rather than empower individuals.Governance, he suggested, is central to the race.

Beyond Oil: How India & US Are Securing the Future of AI Chips

India's talent deep enough to rival challengers: Gor

New Delhi: India formally joined Friday Pax Silica - the US flagship AI and supply chain security initiative that is widely perceived as an antidote to China's influence over critical technologies. Welcoming India, US ambassador Sergio Gor said that the coalition, which comprises some of Washington's closest allies and trusted partners as members, was about ""whether free societies would control the commanding heights of the global economy"" and would define the 21st century economic and technological order.MeitY secretary S Krishnan, US undersecretary for economic growth Jacob Helberg and Gor also signed, apart from the Pax Silica Declaration, a supplementary joint statement that said this partnership signalled a new era in which the world's oldest and largest democracies stood aligned not only in defence of liberty, but in the purposeful pursuit of prosperity and harmony for their peoples.Also read | India-US sign Pax Silica Declaration: New Delhi’s entry ‘strategic and essential’ Together, the two aspire to build an AI future that serves their citizens, strengthens their economies and societies, and refle-cts their shared values of freedom, openness, and the rule of law,"" the statement said.Gor's remarks were more revealing as he said Pax Silica was a coalition of capabilities that replaced coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases. ""India's entry into Pax Silica isn't just symbolic, it's strategic, it's essential.India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers,"" said Gor, who invited India to join the initiative that now has 11 members, on his first day in office last month.For India, Pax Silica is another significant step forward towards the normalisation of the relationship with the US after both sides finalised the framework for an interim trade agreement this month.According to Gor, India brings strength to the coalition as its engineering depth and critical mineral processing capacity offered critical capabilities to the partnership. ""Peace doesn't come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won't. Peace comes through strength. India understands this. India understands strong borders. India understands this part of the world. That strength, that sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,"" said the US ambassador, adding discussions with India were on about building supply chains that would not be held hostage.The Pax Silica Declaration seeks efforts to reduce excessive dependencies and forge new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices, while acknowledging the importance of addressing non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition.Welcoming India to ""co-found"" the future, Gor also said the initiative was about whether innovation happens in Bengaluru and Silicon Valley or in surveillance states that use technology to monitor and control their people. ""We choose freedom. We cho-ose partnership. We choose strength.

Candace Drops 'SECRET' TPUSA Tape: Erika Kirk Heard Laughing Days After Charlie Kirk’s Killing

Witness rejects allegations and calls Candace Owens' narrative “manipulative”

Online reactions intensify pressure on Candace Owens





Commentator Candace Owens is facing intense criticism after a woman she accused of having prior knowledge of the shooting of Charlie Kirk publicly rejected the allegation. The dispute has intensified online debates surrounding conspiracy claims that surfaced in the months following Kirk’s death.Kirk was fatally shot during a September 10, 2025 event at Utah Valley University. Since then, Owens has floated multiple theories questioning the circumstances of the attack and the timeline surrounding those closest to him. Her remarks drew renewed scrutiny after an interview surfaced featuring Tracy Martin, a longtime friend of Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk.Martin, whose daughter reportedly works for Erika Kirk, appeared in an interview shared by commentator Graham Allen. Owens had claimed Martin’s daughter felt uneasy about attending the event where the shooting occurred, suggesting possible foreknowledge.In the interview, Martin praised Erika’s character and rejected the claims outright. “Charlie knew exactly who he was marrying and God knew that Erika would be the woman she is right now.”Addressing Owens’s accusations, she added, “I think when something is taken out of context, plugged into the narrative and then ran out, I can see where people get twisted on this.”She went further, describing the framing of events as “very manipulative,” and warned that when dealing with a “conspiracy psychosis” individuals can “feed the narrative and then they are able to reframe that in any way they wanted to.”Allen promoted the exchange online, framing it as a rebuttal of what he described as false claims.The interview clips rapidly became popular on social media, and users reacted harshly to them. There were commenters who commended Martin because he was defending Erika Kirk and also going directly to the accusations, whilst others urged Owens to take back the comments.One viral post stated, “Candace slandered Erika's BFF Tracy Martin, claiming she had foreknowledge of Charlie's death. Tracy proved otherwise and asked Candace, 'how are you going to right this wrong against my family?' Candace promised to ‘instantaneously’ put a message out. SHE STILL HASN'T.”Owens has not publicly responded to the latest criticism.
