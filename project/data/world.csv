NEW DELHI: In a rare development, Delhi HC acted on communication from Supreme Court of England and Wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the Nirav Modi case. In a recent order, HC sought assistance of Centre while issuing notice to all parties, including the fugitive diamantaire.Justice C Hari Shankar said assistance from govt is also needed “as to the future course of action to be taken in this matter, as there does not appear to be any earlier precedent in which the court acted on the basis of a communication from the foreign court, without a party to the matter approaching court”.The UK court sought HC’s intervention to record the testimony of a Delhi-based Bank of India official as a witness in proceedings abroad concerning Firestar Diamond FZE and its founder Nirav Modi in a loan default dispute.The request was communicated to Delhi HC via Union ministry of law and justice under 1970 Hague Convention on “taking of evidence abroad in civil or commercial matters”, HC noted in its order. To facilitate the process, court made the parties to UK proceedings, including Nirav Modi, also a party to the present matter.HC also asked counsel for Bank of India to clarify if they intend to file a formal application in the matter.","Delhi hc acted on communication from supreme court of england and wales to record statement of a banker in connection with the nirav modi case.

(With inputs from agency)

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday personally received UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the airport in New Delhi, a special gesture asserting the close ties between the two countries, as the visiting leader arrived for a brief but high-level official visit.MBZ’s visit, undertaken at the invitation of Prime Minister Modi, comes amid heightened developments in West Asia.Taking to social media platform X, the Prime Minister said, ""Went to the airport to welcome my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE. His visit illustrates the importance he attaches to a strong India-UAE friendship. Looking forward to our discussions.""The PM later welcomed the UAE president and his family at his official residence on Lok Kalyan Marg.As part of the traditional Indian welcome, PM Modi presented a series of cultural gifts to the visiting dignitaries. President MBZ was gifted a Royal Carved Wooden Jhula (swing) from Gujarat, intricately hand-carved with floral and traditional designs. The jhula, a central fixture in many Gujarati homes, symbolizes togetherness, conversation, and intergenerational bonding, resonating with the UAE’s declaration of 2026 as the Year of Family.In addition, PM Modi presented a handmade Kashmiri Pashmina shawl in an ornate silver box from Telangana, representing India’s rich handloom and handicraft tradition. A similar Pashmina shawl was gifted to Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, accompanied by Kashmiri saffron in an ornate silver box, prized for its deep crimson strands and intense aroma.The ministry of external affairs in a media briefing gave the details of the meeting between the two leaders, which according to foreign secretary “extended beyond the scheduled hours” and happened in both “restricted and expanded format.”The meeting was scheduled for 2 hours, but went well past 3 hours, termed ""substantive"" in terms of the outcome and also setting the tone and direction of India-UAE ties in the near future.The entourage of MBZ included the members of Royal families of both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and senior ministers and officials of UAE government, reflecting on the importance of the visit.""Amongst the members of the delegation were Sheikh Hamad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority; Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of the UAE; Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, also the deputy prime Minister and the minister of defence of the UAE. And also Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who is the deputy chairman of the Presidential Court. In addition, there were the secretary general of the supreme council for national security, the minister for industry and advanced technology, the minister of state for international cooperation, the minister of state for artificial intelligence, digital economy and remote work applications, and the minister of state for defence affairs. Even for this short visit, this was a really, really high-powered delegation that accompanied the President..."" said the foreign secretary Vikram Misri.Talks between PM Modi and president Nahyan focused on advancing the India-UAE partnership, as well as an exchange of views on regional and global issues of mutual interest, the MEA said.Multiple agreements have been signed and agreed upon between the two countries ranging from nuclear and energy cooperation to railways and space. The leaders also discussed taking the bilateral trade between India and UAE to $200 billion by 2032. They also identified AI as a priority sector.""On the trade front, following the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement between the two countries in 2022, the bilateral trade has since crossed $100 billion. In view of this, two leaders decided to raise ambitions and look to double bilateral trade to $200 billion by 2032. It was also decided to facilitate exports of the MSME industries to the West Asian, African and Eurasian regions..."" foreign secretary said.He added, ""The two sides decided to explore partnership in advanced nuclear technologies, including development and deployment of large nuclear reactors and small modular reactors, as well as cooperation in advanced reactor systems, nuclear power plant operations, and maintenance and nuclear safety. Artificial Intelligence was identified as a priority area of cooperation. It was decided to collaborate on setting up a supercomputing cluster in India with UAE partnership. The UAE will also look at investments for expanding data centre capacity in India. The UAE will also participate at a high level in the Artificial Intelligence Summit that India is organising in February 2026. Both sides will also explore the possibility of setting up a digital or a data embassy. This is a relatively new concept, but there will be work done to see how these can be set up under mutually recognised sovereignty agreements...""The two sides also decided on establishing the “House of India” in Abu Dhabi. This will be a unique cultural space which will have a state of the art museum reflective of India’s ancient culture, and a lasting symbol of India-UAE partnership, foreign secretary said.UAE has one of the largest Indian diaspora in the world, close to 4.5 million people from India currently living and working in the Middle Eastern nation. The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation to the UAE president for looking after the interest of the Indian community.Both leaders also discussed the issues in the Middle East and expressed full support for all efforts to promote peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the region. They also unequivocally condemned the cross border terrorism, and for perpetrators, supporters and financiers of all acts of terrorism to be brought to justice.MBZ also expressed support for India’s chairmanship of BRICS grouping this year, and also confirmed UAE high level participation in the AI impact summit that will be held next month, MEA said.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in a post on X shared the list of outcomes.The post said, ""List of Outcomes (12 in total) : Official visit of President HH Sheikh @MohamedBinZayed of UAE to India.""This marks Sheikh Mohamed’s third official visit to India since assuming office as UAE President, and his fifth visit to the country in the past decade, reflecting the frequency of top-level engagement between New Delhi and Abu Dhabi.The visit coincided with ongoing diplomatic activity related to West Asia, with the United States preparing to move to the next phase of its Gaza Peace Plan, which includes the proposed National Committee for the administration of Gaza.Prime Minister Modi has been invited by US President Donald Trump to be part of the Gaza Peace Board, according to a White House statement.India and the UAE have seen sustained engagement across political, economic and defence domains in recent months. Earlier this month, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi visited the UAE to strengthen military cooperation, while external affairs minister S Jaishankar travelled to Abu Dhabi in December for the India-UAE joint commission Meeting and strategic dialogue.India and the UAE share strong political, economic and people-to-people ties, supported by frameworks such as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), the Local Currency Settlement system and a Bilateral Investment Treaty. The two countries also cooperate closely at multilateral forums including the UN, BRICS, I2U2 and the UAE-France-India trilateral.According to the MEA, Sheikh Mohamed’s short visit provides an opportunity for both leaders to review progress in bilateral ties and identify new areas of cooperation amid evolving regional dynamics.","Prime minister narendra modi personally received uae president sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan at the airport in new delhi.

NEW DELHI: The rapidly expanding India-UAE relationship received another upgrade Monday with the two countries signing a letter of intent for a strategic defence partnership as PM Narendra Modi hosted President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for a visit that lasted little over 3 hours but yielded several important outcomes and announcements.These included 4 other agreements including one for space collaboration, another for purchase of 0.5 million metric tonnes per annum of LNG by HPCL from ADNOC Gas over a period of 10 years and yet another letter of intent for development of Dholera special investment region in Gujarat. There were several other announcements including a decision to double bilateral trade to $ 200 billion by 2032, establishment of a supercomputing cluster in India and development and deployment of large nuclear reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs) to boost civil nuclear cooperation.Not for the first time, Modi received Al Nahyan at the airport in a special gesture that, in the words of foreign secretary Vikram Misri, was characteristic of the extremely warm and close relationship that the two leaders shared. “Went to the airport to welcome my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE. His visit illustrates the importance he attaches to a strong India-UAE friendship.Looking forward to our discussions,” said Modi himself in a post on X.The defence letter of intent is expected to establish a Strategic Defence Partnership Framework Agreement and expand defence cooperation across a number of areas, including “defence industrial collaboration, defence innovation and advanced technology, training, education and doctrine, special operations and interoperability, cyber space, counterterrorism”. It comes at a time the UAE has been looking to reduce its reliance on traditional Western suppliers under a diversification strategy and an intent to preserve its strategic autonomy.Talking about defence cooperation, the leaders in fact highlighted deep respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and the importance of strategic autonomy, according to a joint statement.“They acknowledged steady and strong bilateral defence and security cooperation as a core pillar of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They welcomed the momentum generated by the recent exchange of visits by the respective Service Chiefs and Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force of both countries, and the successful conduct of bilateral military exercises,” said the joint statement. Misri said the defence agreement was natural evolution from the already considerable defence cooperation between the two countries and not necessarily a response to any specific event that may have taken place in the region.The leaders also reiterated their “unequivocal condemnation” of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism, and emphasised that no country should provide safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts. Al Nahyan was visiting India weeks after his visit to Pakistan late last year.Modi and Al Nahyan discussed the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) initiative, reaffirming their commitment to the project which, as they agreed in the joint statement, would be of great strategic importance and would significantly enhance the flow of commerce and energy between India, the Middle East and Europe. While there was no mention of Gaza in the joint statement, Misri said both leaders discuss the situation there in the meeting along with other regional and global issues.Both sides also announced setting up of offices and operations of UAE companies –First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and DP World - in the GIFT City in Gujarat. The leaders also agreed to explore the possibility of setting up Digital Embassies under mutually recognised sovereignty arrangements. According to the joint statement, the partnership for Dholera special investment region would include the development of key strategic infrastructure, including an international airport, a pilot training school, a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility, a greenfield port, a smart urban township, railway connectivity, and energy infrastructure",Both agree to double trade to $200bn by 2032 both agree to double trade to $200billion by 20 32.

DHAKA: In the midst of strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka, the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh on Monday visited a Teesta project area close to the strategic Siliguri corridor or Chicken’s Neck — a 22-km narrow land strip — between India’s mainland and its Northeastern states.Chinese envoy Yao Wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project, said the interim govt headed by Muhammad Yunus whose last year controversial pitch for “extension of the Chinese economy” and India’s “landlocked” Northeast remarks echoed in the Dec anti-India protests that targeted Indian diplomatic facilities in Dhaka and other Bangladeshi cities.Water resources adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who accompanied Yao to the project area in Rangpur’s Tepamadhupur Taluk Shahbazpur, said China is keen to start implementation of Teesta Master Plan (TMP) as soon as possible. She said both Bangladesh and China are committed to implementing TMP. However, as the scrutiny process of project is not yet complete, it is not possible to start work at this time, Hasan said.While for Bangladesh, Teesta is a lifeline for agriculture and livelihoods in its northern districts, for India — West Bengal — its equally critical.Hence, a Teesta water-sharing strategy has stretched over decades and a final agreement has remained elusive due to concerns from West Bengal govt.Following a meeting between Yao and national security adviser Khalilur Rahman Sunday, chief adviser Yunus’s press wing posted on X, “Both sides exchanged views on issues of mutual interest, reaffirming longstanding friendship and development cooperation between Bangladesh and China.”“Discussions included Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project and proposed Bangladesh–China Friendship Hospital. In this context, Chinese ambassador informed that he would visit Teesta project area, and reiterated China’s commitment to completing the ongoing technical assessment expeditiously,” it said.The ambassador also reaffirmed his govt’s continued support for Bangladesh’s ongoing democratic transition and conveyed best wishes for the successful conduct of the forthcoming national elections, the press wing said.Yunus, who was appointed chief adviser in 2024, during an interview in China in 2025 had urged Beijing to establish strong economic infrastructure in Bangladesh by leveraging its strategic position as “only guardian of the ocean” in the region.",Chinese envoy yao wen’s visit was related to an technical assessment being carried out under the teesta river comprehensive management and restoration project.

He and two others were airlifted to hospital, but Singh did not survive, officials said. The Army’s White Knight Corps confirmed the death on X.The clash began after troops moved toward suspected hideouts and came under grenade attacks followed by bursts of AK-47 fire in darkness, according to officials. The operation, codenamed Trashi-I, was launched on intelligence indicating terrorist presence in the rugged, wooded hills.On Monday, forces tightened the cordon and expanded searches, reinforcing units in the forested zone. Investigators believe two or three terrorists are involved. Officials estimate about 30 terrorists are active across the wider Jammu region.During the continuing sweep, troops uncovered a hideout stocked with rations and utensils, signalling sustained presence in the area.“The operation is ongoing,” an official said.The gunfight is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in the Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua district, south of the Pir Panjal range. Security across Jammu has been stepped up ahead of Republic Day.Kishtwar, a remote district east of the Chenab and south of Kashmir Valley, saw intensified counterterrorism efforts in 2025 as forces tracked Pakistan-based terrorists through steep terrain and thick forests.

As a result, plant load factors (PLFs) of thermal power plants are likely to fall to 64-66% in the current and next fiscal from 69% in the last financial year.An uptick in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and a healthy outlook for base-load demand are reviving capital expenditure in the thermal segment. Crisil said this will push up leverage for thermal power producers over the next 3-4 years, while steady cash flows and controlled debt levels are expected to keep credit profiles stable.“Growth in power demand is expected to decelerate to 1-2% this fiscal because of an early monsoon and a relatively cool summer, but rebound to 4-6% next fiscal on a low base. Despite this, the compound annual growth rate will be less than 4% over this fiscal and the next, weaker than the 5.6% recorded over the last five fiscals,” Crisil said in its report.In contrast, RE generation is poised to log a CAGR of 18-20% over this fiscal and the next, driven by 75-85 gigawatt (GW) of capacity additions amid a robust pipeline of utility-scale projects and a ramp-up in commercial, industrial and rooftop installations. This will result in RE meeting most of the incremental power demand in the country.India’s total installed power generation capacity currently stands at nearly 514 gigawatts (GW), comprising about 247 GW of thermal and 267 GW of non-fossil capacity. While the government continues to expand non-fossil generation capacity in line with its 500 GW target for 2030, coal is expected to remain central to India’s electricity system over the next few years.“Despite its declining share, thermal power remains crucial as grid absorption of RE is constrained by its intermittent nature and the nascent adoption of energy storage solutions. This has sparked a revival in capex in the thermal power sector,” said Manish Gupta, deputy chief ratings officer, Crisil Ratings.",The share of fossil fuels in power generation is set to drop below 70% next fiscal. This is owing to slower growth in power demand and a surge in renewable energy (re) generation. The agency said the share of thermal power is expected to slip to 72% in 2025-26.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126712585,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1020456,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership.

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on monday, crossing the rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

Why are New York Rangers selling and could Calgary Flames make another big move?

NHL Now | What's next for the New York Rangers?

The most recent NHL gossip has brought the New York Rangers and Calgary Flames right in the middle of the trade deadline talk. With the uncertainty regarding the team’s direction, salary cap flexibility, and long-term plans all coming to the surface, both teams seem to be going through some very important transitions. The market now could really change the future of each team a lot and also cause a redistribution of power across the league.The New York Rangers team manager, Chris Drury, was very open about the organization’s direction, which made that reality clearer. He was indicating that there is a readiness to pull back from the present roster. On the other hand, the Calgary Flames’ recent trading activity is viewed as a signal that more trades could follow, particularly in the case of veteran forwards who are still attractive to other teams in the league.Drury’s letter to the fans, which was made public on Friday, probably confirmed the many suspicions: New York is getting ready to retool. Drury said that the idea is to bring in young NHL players and prospects that are fast, skilled, and have a winning mindset, along with the creation of long-term salary cap flexibility. The note was reminiscent of the 2018 “Letter” era and got some fans to call it “Letter 2.0.” Drury further said that players who have participated in recent long playoff runs might be traded.Vincent Z. Mercogliano of The Athletic has mentioned that the uncertainty surrounds many big names. Artemi Panarin has been told that he will not be offered a contract extension and will become a UFA on July 1, while Drury is reportedly willing to assist a trade if Panarin lifts his no-movement clause. On the other hand, Mika Zibanejad has assured the team of his loyalty, thus making a deadline deal less likely. Vincent Trocheck, together with Alexis Lafreniere and Braden Schneider, is also getting interest from teams that want to trade.In the meantime, the trade of Rasmus Andersson by the Flames to Vegas has sparked more rumors in Calgary. Daniel Austin of the Calgary Sun opines that the veterans Nazem Kadri and Blake Coleman might be next as the Flames consider trading established players for future assets.The Rangers are changing their strategy, whereas the Flames are not yet done; thus, this trade season could result in massive changes. Both franchises seem to be prepared to make daring moves that could shape their future.","New york rangers team manager, chris drury, was very open about the organization’s direction.

Oscar De La Hoya stresses loyalty as Vergil Ortiz Jr dispute deepens



Oscar De La Hoya is once again facing tension with one of his fighters. Months after his public fallout with Ryan Garcia, the Golden Boy Promotions boss finds himself in another high-profile dispute. This time, it involves unbeaten interim light middleweight champion Vergil Ortiz Jr. The issue centers on the failed negotiations for a much-anticipated fight against Jaron “Boots” Ennis. As talks collapsed, legal action soon followed.Ortiz Jr has now filed a lawsuit against Golden Boy Promotions, accusing the company of breaching their contract. The situation escalated after De La Hoya sent a legal notice to Ortiz’s management for negotiating the fight independently. With deadlines missed, DAZN growing unhappy, and Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom Boxing unable to close the deal, the conflict has turned into a major promotional standoff.As the legal battle unfolds, Oscar De La Hoya took to social media to share his views on a fighter’s career and loyalty. Drawing from his own experience, he reminded fighters that careers are short and focus is vital. On his Instagram story, he wrote fighters must remain loyal and trust guidance from those who have already walked the same path.He added that he sees himself as someone who has lived that life and wants to protect fighters from costly mistakes.De La Hoya later expanded on the emotional side of promotion. He explained that his biggest satisfaction comes from building strong bonds with fighters and feeling that trust is returned. Vergil Ortiz Jr has been with Golden Boy since turning professional in 2016 but now wants to exit the deal, claiming interference with his expected earnings from the Jaron “Boots” Ennis fight.According to Ortiz’s legal team, uncertainty over Golden Boy’s agreement with DAZN gives him the right to seek separation. De La Hoya, however, insists his intentions were misunderstood. He said he was only pushing for better money for Ortiz. He explained that he demanded a 60-40 purse split in Ortiz’s favor, along with a small bonus for the winner, because he felt his fighter had earned it.When Matchroom failed to meet the deadline, Ortiz’s manager reportedly stepped in to negotiate directly. That move triggered De La Hoya’s legal response. Golden Boy has since stated it will strongly contest the lawsuit, maintaining the contract is valid and claiming Ortiz and his team violated its terms.","Oscar de la hoya is embroiled in a legal dispute with one of his fighters.

Lara Trump shares viral golfing photos with Donald Trump and granddaughter

Bill Maher Clashes With Lara Trump After She Downplays Trump’s ‘Piggy’ Insult On Air Force One

Social media responds with warmth and nostalgia

How a shared family moment cut through public tension





Lara Trump has recently bestowed upon social media participants a rare treat with a glimpse into the less familiar, more personal side of the Trump family. Through the sharing of just a few images on X, she has reached the hearts of many with this intimate family picture involving her young daughter's fun-filled golf game with her grandfather, US President Donald Trump himself, with whom she gets to spend quality time while playing their favourite game, golf. This is one instance where the family, known for its political fervour, has been accepted with such fervour not for their political ideology but for this common family experience that speaks volumes about their humanity despite their fame and power.The photographs depicted Donald Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart, with his granddaughter sitting alongside him, looking happy and carefree. Moreover, there were no signs of poses or dramatic settings, only a serene capture of moments spent with each other. The informal nature of this post was a major factor that led to its success. The post was not meant for any particular message or statement, but only for a casual share by Lara Trump. The post succeeded in gathering tens of thousands of views, not because it was political or held any significance, but because it was something that was widely understood.The online response was largely positive, with many people describing the photographs as “wholesome” and “heartwarming”.Several users reflected on the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren, sharing how the images stirred personal memories and emotions. One user wrote, “What a great moment for her! My kids miss their Gramps,” while another commented, “Core memory unlocked!”, capturing the sense of nostalgia the post evoked. Others reacted more light-heartedly, with remarks such as, “Awww, I was wondering what Grandpa Trump was up to today!” and “Cutest thing I have seen all day.”Part of the post’s impact lay in its timing and tone. At a moment when public discourse is often polarised, the photographs presented a version of public life stripped of commentary and conflict. They highlighted how figures who dominate global headlines also occupy familiar family roles, such as grandparents enjoying simple moments with their loved ones.","Lara trump shared a series of photos of her daughter with her grandfather, us president donald trump.

Does India have something like this?





NEW DELHIDonald Trump’s presidency has been defined by decisions that appear impulsive on the surface but often reveal a deeper, if blunt, strategic instinct. One such episode is the renewed Greenland controversy, which has re-emerged alongside Trump’s ambitious proposal for a multi-layered US missile defence shield dubbed the “Golden Dome. ”Trump’s renewed focus on Greenland has reignited global debate over whether the Arctic island is being viewed as a source of untapped natural resources or as a pivotal node in a future missile defence architecture aimed squarely at Russia and China. Trump himself has now explicitly linked the two.“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on January 14. “Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable.”The statement has sent ripples through Moscow and Beijing, where analysts see Greenland not as a commercial asset but as a potential cornerstone of a US-led strategic shield that could alter the global balance of deterrence.Greenland’s value lies less in what is beneath its ice and more in where it sits on the map.Located between North America and Eurasia, Greenland occupies a central position along the shortest ballistic missile trajectories between Russia and the United States. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from Russia towards the US would typically travel over the Arctic, making early detection in this region crucial.For decades, US military planners have viewed Greenland as an irreplaceable early-warning outpost. Under a 1951 defence agreement with Denmark, the US operates the Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base) in northern Greenland. The base houses advanced missile warning and space surveillance systems, including the AN/FPS-132 radar, a critical component of the US ballistic missile defence network.These systems are designed to detect missile launches within seconds, track objects in space, and feed data into US command-and-control networks. In any future missile defence architecture that seeks to intercept threats in their earliest phases, Greenland offers a vantage point that few other locations can match.Trump’s argument rests on this geography. In his telling, failure to tighten US control over Greenland risks allowing adversaries to exploit the same strategic advantages.“We need that because if you take a look outside of Greenland right now, there are Russian destroyers, there are Chinese destroyers, and, bigger, there are Russian submarines all over the place,” Trump said. “We’re not gonna have Russia or China occupy Greenland, and that’s what they’re going to do if we don’t.”While defence experts have questioned the immediacy of such threats, the strategic logic behind Greenland’s importance is widely accepted across military circles.Trump’s Greenland push has often been dismissed as a real-estate fantasy. Yet his own framing makes clear that this is not about property acquisition in a commercial sense.The White House reinforced this messaging on January 14 by releasing a photograph suggesting Greenland’s future lay at a crossroads between alignment with the US or falling into the orbit of Russia and China.Trump’s worldview favours territorial control over alliance management. Where previous administrations relied on treaties, basing agreements, and multilateral frameworks, Trump has consistently signalled a preference for direct control that cannot be reversed by political change.In this context, Greenland represents permanence. Defence cooperation agreements can be renegotiated; sovereign territory cannot.For Trump, Greenland’s value is magnified by the Arctic’s transformation into a zone of strategic competition. Melting ice has opened new maritime routes, expanded access to undersea resources, and increased naval and submarine activity. Russia has steadily expanded its Arctic military footprint, while China — despite being geographically distant — has labelled itself a “near-Arctic state” and invested heavily in polar research, infrastructure, and partnerships.From Washington’s perspective, any missile defence system designed to counter future threats must be Arctic-centric. Greenland fits squarely into that calculation.The Golden Dome is not an operational weapons system. It is a proposed concept for a comprehensive, layered missile defence architecture designed to protect the US homeland against a wide spectrum of threats.Unlike existing missile defence systems, which are limited in scope and designed to counter small-scale attacks from so-called rogue states, the Golden Dome envisions:Trump has described the Golden Dome as a transformational leap in homeland defence — a modern successor to Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative.The ambition of the project is reflected in its estimated cost, frequently cited at around $175 billion, though independent analysts believe the true figure could be far higher once development, deployment, and maintenance are factored in.Critically, the Golden Dome is not designed merely to reduce damage in a limited conflict. Its implicit promise is near-invulnerability, a goal that has long been viewed with scepticism by arms control experts.Confusion around the Golden Dome is often fuelled by loose comparisons with Israel’s Iron Dome, a system that is not only operational but has been tested repeatedly under wartime conditions. Despite the similarity in naming, the two are designed for entirely different kinds of wars.Iron Dome is a tactical air defence system developed by Israel to counter short-range rockets, artillery shells, and mortars fired primarily by non-state actors such as Hamas and Hezbollah. It is optimised to protect cities, population centres, and military bases over limited geographic areas, typically within a range of a few dozen kilometres. The system operates fully within the Earth’s atmosphere, engaging threats that are relatively slow, unguided, and conventional in nature.One of Iron Dome’s defining features is its selective interception logic. Using radar and fire-control algorithms, the system rapidly calculates whether an incoming projectile is likely to strike a populated area or critical infrastructure. If the assessment shows the rocket will fall in an open field or the sea, Iron Dome does not intercept it, conserving interceptors and reducing costs. This discrimination is central to its effectiveness.Iron Dome has proven its value in multiple conflicts — including the 2012, 2014, 2021 and 2023 Israel–Hamas wars — where Israeli authorities reported interception rates of around 90 per cent for rockets assessed as threatening populated areas. During periods of intense fighting, the system has intercepted thousands of rockets, enabling Israel to limit civilian casualties and avoid wider escalation despite sustained barrages.The Golden Dome, by contrast, operates in a completely different strategic universe. It is not designed to stop crude rockets fired from nearby territory, but to intercept nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles, and long-range cruise missiles launched by major powers. These weapons travel at hypersonic or near-orbital speeds, often outside the atmosphere, and are designed to evade or overwhelm defences.Unlike Iron Dome, where limited leakage is tolerable, a strategic missile defence system like the Golden Dome operates under a near-zero-failure margin — a single missile getting through could be catastrophic. This makes the technological, financial, and geopolitical challenges vastly more complex.In short, Iron Dome is a battlefield shield that mitigates damage during ongoing conflicts. The Golden Dome is an attempt — still theoretical — at strategic invulnerability. The former manages risk; the latter seeks to rewrite deterrence itself.The United States has deliberately avoided building a comprehensive missile shield for decades, not because of a lack of technological ambition, but because of the strategic consequences.A system that promises to neutralise an adversary’s nuclear deterrent risks destabilising the balance that has prevented nuclear war since 1945. If rivals believe their retaliatory capability is compromised, they may respond by:Russian officials have been explicit in their concerns. After the Golden Dome concept was formally announced last year, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the project undermines strategic stability by creating a global missile defence system.Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov went further, calling space-based interceptors “extremely destabilising” and warning that they pave the way for the militarisation of space.“I would like to emphasize that there are no grounds for alarm, there are grounds for serious concern,” Ryabkov said, adding that Russia’s strategic systems are designed to penetrate any layered defence.Russian military analysts see Greenland as a critical enabler of the Golden Dome’s Arctic layer.Alexander Stepanov, a military expert at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, told TASS that the Golden Dome deployment in Greenland would focus on tracking and intercepting Russian weapons.“The Golden Dome project is aimed at monitoring airspace and near-Earth space for the timely detection of launches and interception of various types of offensive weapons,” he said. “This is primarily about developing a countermeasure capability against Russian hypersonic weapons.”Russia currently fields four hypersonic systems — Kinzhal, Tsirkon, Avangard, and Oreshnik — which travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5 and follow unpredictable trajectories.Stepanov added that the Pentagon may seek to deploy additional radars in Greenland, including upgraded AN/TPY-2 systems with gallium nitride antenna arrays, as well as expanded naval infrastructure to support nuclear submarines operating in the Arctic.Former Russian space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin was even more blunt.“Orbital sensors, ground interceptors, decision-making algorithms — all this requires advantageous geography,” he said. “Greenland, with its Arctic position, proximity to Russia, and convenience for northern ICBM trajectories, fits perfectly into this architecture.”He warned that such developments could mark “the dismantling of the entire system of strategic stability in the world.”China’s response has been more measured but no less concerned. A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Golden Dome represents an “unconstrained” missile defence programme that risks violating the Outer Space Treaty and accelerating the militarisation of space.Chinese scholars writing in Contemporary International Relations argued that the Golden Dome marks a shift away from limited deterrence towards a system aimed at countering major nuclear powers for the first time.An analysis by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) noted that Chinese and Russian analysts fear a successful Golden Dome could weaken their nuclear deterrents by reducing their ability to threaten the US homeland.India does not possess — nor is it seeking — a system comparable to the Golden Dome.New Delhi has developed a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme aimed at protecting select targets against limited missile threats. This includes the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) and Advanced Air Defence (AAD) interceptors, along with newer systems such as the PDV interceptor tested against long-range threats.India’s approach remains regionally focused and deterrence-based, designed to counter limited threats rather than establish national invulnerability. Unlike the Golden Dome, India’s missile defence posture does not seek to neutralise the strategic deterrents of major powers.Also read - Missile shield over Delhi: India may buy NASAMS-II air defence system from US Trump’s Greenland gambit and the Golden Dome proposal are two sides of the same coin: a belief that geography, technology, and dominance can replace the delicate balance of deterrence that has governed nuclear relations for nearly eight decades.Whether the Golden Dome ever moves beyond rhetoric remains uncertain. What is clear, however, is that Greenland has once again become a focal point of great-power rivalry — not for what it produces, but for what it allows nations to see, track, and potentially destroy.In the Arctic, geography is destiny. And in Trump’s strategic imagination, Greenland may be the keystone that holds the Golden Dome in place.",Trump’s greenland push has often been dismissed as a real-estate fantasy. Trump himself has now explicitly linked the two. Analysts see greenland not as a commercial asset but as a potential cornerstone of a us-led strategic shield.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126675035,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1758109,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
