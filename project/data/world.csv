House panel slams HAL 'inefficiencies',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/house-panel-slams-hal-inefficiencies/articleshow/119623426.cms,"Already facing flak for the huge delay in production of the indigenous Tejas fighters as well as the grounding of the over 330 Dhruv advanced light helicopters for safety checks since a crash on Jan 5, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) came under fresh ack-ack fire on Thursday in Parliament.The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed HAL for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “Systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder HAL’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh in recent weeks has publicly lashed out at HAL, noting that he was “just not confident” of the defence PSU, which was a “very wrong” thing to happen. The IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready, he said.The committee, on its part, stressed the “urgent need” for HAL to transition from a “reactive to a proactive R&D strategy”, ensuring that technological advancements align seamlessly with national defence objectives and market requirements.While recognizing HAL’s pivotal role in advancing the country’s defence and aerospace capabilities, contributing significantly to indigenous aircraft, helicopters and engine development, the committee said a CAG report of 2023 had highlighted “critical shortcomings” in its project planning, execution, procurement delays and cost overruns.“The committee firmly believes that rigorous adherence to pre-project processes, enhanced risk assessment mechanisms, and structured stakeholder engagements are essential for HAL to achieve global competitiveness in defence manufacturing,” it said.Strengthening financial oversight, establishing robust market research frameworks, and ensuring timely compliance with international certification standards is crucial for HAL to position itself as a leading aerospace powerhouse on the global stage.The committee urged the HAL and defence ministry to implement the recommendations in letter and spirit, ensuring that future projects are executed with greater efficiency, financial prudence, and strategic foresight.“The success of India’s defence modernization and indigenization efforts will depend not just on technological advancements but on the ability to integrate innovation with effective project management, accountability, and long-term vision. HAL’s progress in these areas will not only strengthen national security but also cement India’s position as a global leader in defence and aerospace manufacturing,” it said.","The parliamentary committee on public undertakings slammed hal for prolonged project timelines, impaired costs, and missed strategic opportunities. “systemic inefficiencies continue to hinder hal’s ability to meet operational demands (of the armed forces) effectively,” it said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119623444,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24094,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Raghav Chadha says 'Make in India' should become 'Make AI in India',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-has-deepseek-us-has-chatgpt-raghav-chadha-says-make-in-india-should-become-make-ai-in-india/articleshow/119480687.cms,"Poll Should 'Make in India' expand to focus on AI technologies? Disagree Somewhat agree Strongly agree

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha on Tuesday raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha about India's position in artificial intelligence (AI), as the United States and China continue to advance in the field.He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru. Therefore, alongside 'Make in India,' India must also move forward with 'Make AI in India ,'"" the AAP MP said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, where he said AI could help improve sectors like health, agriculture, and education.",Aam aadmi party mp raghav chadha raised concerns in the rajya sabha about india's position in artificial intelligence.

"Isro attempts & succeeds in 'rolling' SpaDeX satellites, learning key for future docking",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-attempts-succeeds-in-rolling-spadex-satellites-learning-key-for-future-docking/articleshow/119613052.cms,"What was done

Why it’s important

BENGALURU: Isro, which recently undocked the two satellites part of its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on March 13, has successfully completed another experiment — the “rolling” or “rotating” experiment — which involved circumnavigation of one of the satellites and bringing it back to the same spot.This experiment, being likened to the Chandrayaan-3 “hop” experiment the space agency conducted on Moon in terms of learning it provides for future missions, would help Isro validate multiple softwares, ground station control and more.Isro chairman V Narayanan confirmed to TOI that the experiment was carried out last week, and said: “We’ve completed the rolling experiment. The satellites have a lot of propellant… I have only told [the teams] one thing, please do everything [on] simulation on ground [first]. Let us be very careful. Let us not make any mistakes as a wealth of data can be generated [through various experiments].So, what exactly did Isro do? Imagine you and your friend outside a coffee shop on Church Street (Bengaluru).After a long hug (docking), your friend has taken a few steps away (undocking) from you while still in your line of sight. Now, your friend either does a somersault or runs around making a circle, returning to her/his original position. That’s what happened with the satellite in the latest experiment.During the whole time, the satellite performing the experiment was in the line of vision of the other satellite. The experiment was to help Isro validate its control over satellite manoeuvring from ground — that means a slew of softwares, sensors, positioning tech etc. There is no immediate confirmation if the satellite did the circumnavigation (do the full circle) horizontally or vertically (somersault).As reported by TOI earlier, Isro’s first docking on Jan 16, was only the first step towards Isro mastering this technology that is critical for several future missions, including the Chandrayaan-4 sample return mission to the Moon and human spaceflight missions part of the extended Gaganyaan programme Isro will need to dock in various conditions, some of which will be attempted as part of the current mission. Isro will conduct more docking as part of SpaDeX. “The next slot is only next month. We are planning many things,” Narayanan said.Last week’s experiment will help Isro understand what it takes to bring an object to a desired spot from different orientations for docking. It will also help Isro learn whether docking could be done vertically and so on.With a lot of fuel left in the satellite, Isro is expected to carry out more experiments. Afterall, SpaDex is an experimental mission and Isro is hoping to make the most of it. Also, once the next docking is complete, there will be another attempt to do power transfer between the satellites, learning from which — some lessons have already been learnt from the first attempt — will be crucial for future mission design and development.",Isro chairman v narayanan confirmed to toi that the experiment was carried out last week.

Armed forces conduct massive integrated exercise in Arunachal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/armed-forces-conduct-massive-integrated-exercise-in-arunachal/articleshow/119613487.cms,"NEW DELHI: India-China diplomatic talks may now be taking a slightly “positive” trajectory but the armed forces continue to hone their high-altitude combat skills through intensive exercises, while the Army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders.‘Prachand Prahar (fierce attack)’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-Service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector of the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the last three days.“The exercise involved Army, IAF and the other combat elements in a synergised combat drill designed to simulate future warfare. It reinforces India’s resolve to deter and, if necessary, decisively respond to any emerging security challenge along its strategic frontiers,” a senior officer said.Towards the western sector of the LAC, which stretches from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, the headquarters of the new 72 Infantry Division is coming up at Pathankot under the Udhampur-based Northern Command. “There will be no fresh accretion of troops for the 72 Division. It’s part of the Army’s restructuring and reorganization plan that has been underway for some years,” a source told TOI.The new division is likely to eventually replace the “Uniform Force” of the Army’s specialized counter-insurgency Rashtriya Rifles (RR) that was rushed to eastern Ladakh after the multiple incursions by Chinese troops there in April 2020.In addition to the Panagarh-based 17 Mountain Strike Corps for the eastern sector, the Mathura-based 1 Strike Corps (each corps has 70,000-80,000 soldiers) was earlier also “rebalanced” to the LAC from its previous role on the western front with Pakistan, as was reported by TOI.There are as yet no signs of de-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC after disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has led to restoration of patrolling by the rival soldiers and grazing by herders as well as reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation.China has continued to strengthen its military positions and infrastructure build-up all along the LAC, with PLA troops continuing to be forward deployed with heavy weapon systems in large numbers.India, too, has maintained “mirror deployments”. In Arunachal, areas like Yangtse -- where the rival troops had clashed in Dec 2022 -- Asaphila and Subansiri river valley remain major flashpoints.During Prachand Prahar, long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft, armed helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), loitering munitions, and space-based assets were employed to achieve total situational awareness and rapid target engagement.“Once simulated targets were identified, they were swiftly neutralised through coordinated strikes using fighter aircraft, long-range Pinaka rocket systems, medium artillery guns, swarm drones, kamikaze drones, and armed helicopters — all executed in an electronically contested environment that simulated modern battlefield conditions,” another officer said.This integrated tri-service exercise builds on the momentum of the `Poorvi Prahar’ exercise last Nov, which focused primarily on the integrated application of aviation assets. “Prachand Prahaar has now taken that concept further by validating a fully integrated approach to surveillance, command and control, and precision firepower across the three Services,” he said.","The army is raising a new infantry division of around 15,000 soldiers as part of its continuing rejig of forces and firepower for the northern borders. ‘prachand prahar’ is the telling name of the latest integrated tri-service multi-domain warfare exercise conducted ‘deep’ in the high-altitude terrain of arunachal pradesh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119613442,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-904384,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll What is your primary concern regarding US visa appointment availability? Lack of transparency Fraudulent practices Reliability of agents Long wait times

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The us embassy in india is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

Who is behind the El Grande Americano mask in WWE?



El Grande Americano has been making waves as the newest luchador on the WWE roster who is looking very familiar to the fans.The WWE Universe has been witnessing a new masked luchador making waves in recent memory on Monday Night RAW. The man who dons an American-style mask and ring gear and does some incredible dives and hops is coming to be known as ‘ El Americano Grande .’ So it is interesting to dive further into the identity of this masked luchador and explore his WWE tenure so far.El Grande Americano made his first appearance on the March 17th edition of Monday Night RAW. He came from the audience area and jumped Rey Mysterio and Dragon Lee during their match against The New Day members, Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, leading them to victory. This was followed by a chase by the security officials and eventually being caught and escorted out of the arena by them.The masked luchador was later unveiled to be an official part of Monday Night RAW. He competed in his first match against Dragon Lee on the following edition of RAW. It was a classic lucha-style encounter between them, although fans did notice some familiar chops by El Grande Americano relating his identity with a current RAW star. In the end, he emerged victorious in his debut match via submission.For weeks, there have been speculations regarding the identity of the man behind the El Grande Americano mask. Many fans believe that it is Chad Gable who is under the mask. As it was seen, Gable left WWE for a while to explore other fighting styles to combat the threat of lucha libre.He was shown to have encountered an unknown man who explained him about luchadors and told him that he needed to understand what he was fighting. It was just weeks later that El Grande Americano made his first appearance on Monday Night RAW. Moreover, his size, ripped physique and physical stature resembled to that of Gable very much.Interestingly, the fans witnessed a lot of Chad Gable moves delivered by El Grande Americano during his match against Dragon Lee such as his popular German Suplex. Although fans did see Gable and El Grande together backstage together when he was being escorted out of the building, there is a good chance that it was an impostor set up by Chad Gable to shift the attention of the fans from him. As the weeks go by, it will be interesting to see WWE play out the storyline involving El Grande Americano on RAW.Also read: Fans have a new update for an upcoming WWE premium live event (PLE)",The wwe universe has been witnessing a new masked luchador making waves on monday night raw.

Uncertainty for asylum seekers: Indian asylum seekers and refugees who have already passed extensive background checks could see their legal status remain uncertain, affecting their access to work, healthcare, and other essential services.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, escalating concerns among Indian immigrants—one of the largest migrant groups in the United States. The decision is part of a broader immigration crackdown aimed at increasing scrutiny and national security checks.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the pause aligns with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to increase immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety, and national security risks.The freeze affects immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals, who form one of the largest immigrant groups in the US. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the country as of 2023, many could face significant delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.","The trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

US President Donald Trump stated on Wednesday (March 26) that he is open to reducing tariffs on China to facilitate a deal for TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app. TikTok, used by 170 million Americans, faces a looming April 5 deadline for divestment or a potential US ban. Speaking to reporters, Trump acknowledged that China’s approval is necessary for any agreement to move forward. “Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he said, indicating that tariffs could be used as a bargaining tool to push the sale.According to a Reuters report, he also signaled a willingness to extend the April 5 deadline if a deal is not reached in time, reinforcing that resolving TikTok’s ownership remains a priority for his administration.Trump has previously used tariffs to pressure China in trade and technology disputes. On his first day in office, he warned that he could impose new tariffs if Beijing did not approve a US deal for TikTok. Since then, the Trump administration has added 20% in levies to all Chinese imports.As per the report, Trump acknowledged that China’s approval is crucial for any agreement and suggested that a tariff reduction could help finalise the deal.Concerns over TikTok’s Chinese ownership have been ongoing in Washington, with lawmakers fearing the app could be used for data collection and influence operations by the Chinese government. In 2024, Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations by January 19, citing national security risks. The app was briefly banned after the US Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump later postponed enforcement to April 5 through an executive order.The White House has taken an active role in negotiations, with talks reportedly centering on non-Chinese investors increasing their stakes in ByteDance to take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations. Vice President JD Vance has said he expects a general agreement on the deal by April 5.","Us president donald trump is open to reducing tariffs on china to facilitate a deal for tiktok’s chinese parent, bytedance, to sell the app. Tiktok, used by 170 million americans, faces a looming april 5 deadline for divestment or a potential us ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119579233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33438,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Fired feds, leaking secrets: How China is exploiting DOGE layoffs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secretive-chinese-network-doge-musk-and-trump-doge-layoffs/articleshow/119602501.cms,"Why it matters

The justice department recently charged eight Chinese nationals in a sprawling cyber espionage campaign — a small piece of what the FBI has long warned is the most expansive hacking program on the planet.

Beijing’s operations are increasingly stealthy, structured, and synchronized with China's national strategy. Experts now warn that the most dangerous cyber activity may not be a viral malware or ransomware attack — but the subtle cultivation of real-world sources within US agencies.

Add to that the wave of mass federal layoffs under Trump’s DOGE initiative, and analysts say China is seizing a rare opportunity to exploit thousands of newly unemployed US officials with security clearances.

The use of job scams to recruit foreign assets isn’t new—nor is it unique to China. The CIA has used similar tactics to try and flip Russian officials, even releasing recruitment videos on dark web forums and Telegram channels.

But China’s efforts are more covert, more prolonged, and now possibly more effective. Holden Triplett, who led FBI offices in Beijing and Moscow, calls the current environment a “recruiter’s dream.”

The target: Fired, frustrated, and in possession of secrets

As per a CNN report, the Chinese campaign is emerging just as the US federal government undergoes an aggressive restructuring. Following Trump’s order to eliminate “waste, bloat, and insularity,” thousands of workers have been cut—many in intelligence, defense, and cybersecurity. Eleven CIA and DNI employees were let go following the shuttering of diversity and equity programs. Others face termination in an ongoing agency-wide reorganization.

Officials within the intelligence community are alarmed. A redacted document from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service states with “high confidence” that foreign adversaries are actively working to recruit these laid-off employees. According to CNN, some of these workers were not even given standard exit briefings that typically include warnings about foreign approaches.

Now, Beijing appears to be exploiting that gap—approaching former officials through seemingly legitimate companies and employment channels.

“It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to see that these cast-aside federal workers with a wealth of institutional knowledge represent staggeringly attractive targets to the intelligence services of our competitors and adversaries,” one US official said.

Between the lines

Some job ads specifically targeted ""recently laid-off US federal employees.""

Addresses listed for these firms often led to empty lots or shell companies.

One employee told Reuters he was paid thousands of dollars to post job listings by two anonymous Chinese contacts named “Eric” and “Will.”

Zoom in

This isn’t just a few phishing emails — it's a systemic campaign.

Platforms: LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit and Craigslist are being used to find disaffected or recently terminated government workers.

Tactics: Foreign operatives pose as recruiters or consultants. Some ask if applicants are ""open to work,"" then escalate to requests for insider knowledge or referrals.

Targets: Probationary employees (often with less job protection), DEI-related officers terminated by Trump orders, and even undercover CIA recruits.

In a high-profile example from 2020, a Singaporean national named Jun Wei Yeo pleaded guilty in US court to acting as a Chinese agent. He created a fake consulting firm and recruited American sources via job ads, paying them to write intelligence reports — without ever disclosing the client was the Chinese government.

The big picture

Political espionage: The MSS (Ministry of State Security), China’s main foreign intelligence arm, has led high-value operations like Salt Typhoon, which breached nine US telecom firms — exposing officials' calls and texts. Pre-positioning for sabotage: Volt Typhoon, a PLA-linked group, infiltrated power plants, ports, and water facilities across the US and Guam. These are not just probes — they’re laying groundwork for potential wartime disruption. Intellectual property theft: China’s hackers have siphoned blueprints, trade secrets and business strategies from US firms for years. Former NSA chief Keith Alexander once called it “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” Now, a new frontier is opening: human intelligence, via sophisticated job scams designed to lure freshly terminated federal employees.

What separates China from their peers like Russia, North Korea and Iran”, says Mr Hultquist, is that those states routinely cross the line from espionage to disruption, from spying and reconnaissance to outright sabotage. China has “never pulled the trigger”, he says. Even in American infrastructure networks, China has stopped short of inserting destructive code. “We can see them doing the reconnaissance. We can see them getting into place. They’re not showing us the weapon. An article in the Economist

What they’re saying

Holden Triplett, ex-FBI counterintelligence director: “Employees that feel they have been mistreated by an employer have historically been much more likely to disclose sensitive information.” We may be creating, albeit somewhat unintentionally, the perfect recruitment environment,” Triplett told CNN.

David Aaron, former DOJ prosecutor: “Foreign intelligence services often use job recruitment scams to recruit sources without them even knowing they are working for a foreign government.”

White House spokesperson: Both active and former government employees must recognize the danger these governments pose and the importance of safeguarding government information.”

Chinese Embassy: China respects data privacy and security” and was “unaware of any entities involved in such campaigns.”

The intrigue

What’s next

CIA and Defense officials are quietly reviewing layoff protocols.

Intelligence leaders are urging stronger post-employment exit briefings.

LinkedIn says it's increasing efforts to detect and remove fake recruiters.

. (China is expectedly taking advantage of the recent wave of US federal layoffs. A network linked to Chinese intelligence is using fake job ads, made-up consulting firms, and shell companies to target former government workers. The goal is to trick them into sharing sensitive information—sometimes without even realizing it, a Reuters report claimed.Cybersecurity researchers uncovered the campaign, and US officials have confirmed it. It comes as thousands of federal employees are losing their jobs under the Donald Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE -- an agency that Elon Musk is heavily involved in and has been described as a close advisor to the president in the day-to-day activities of the department.Many of those being targeted have experience in national security, technology, or intelligence work.As per the Reuters report, China’s strategy is simple: find people who are out of work and vulnerable. The job ads are posted on familiar sites like LinkedIn and Craigslist and often look legitimate. But behind them is a quiet effort to collect secrets from people who used to help protect them.A recent investigation by Reuters and cyber researcher Max Lesser revealed that a network of fake consulting firms, tied digitally to a mysterious Chinese company called Smiao Intelligence, has been actively recruiting former US government workers.The companies involved — like RiverMerge Strategies and Wavemax Innovation — appear legitimate at first glance but are part of a larger web that shares servers, phone numbers, and contact links with Smiao.“What makes this activity significant is that the network seeks to exploit the financial vulnerabilities of former federal workers affected by recent mass layoffs,” said Lesser.The US intelligence community has assessed with “high confidence” that both China and Russia are aggressively targeting these displaced workers, especially those with access to critical infrastructure or national security knowledge.As per a report in the Economist, China’s cyber operations have evolved dramatically over the past decade. What began as noisy hacks from visible Shanghai servers has become a refined intelligence machine with three overlapping goals:China’s hacking ecosystem isn’t limited to government operatives.Chengdu, home to the MSS-linked firm i-Soon, has become a hotbed of cyber talent. The city hosts elite hacking contests like the Tianfu Cup and Wangding Cup, dubbed China’s “cyber Olympics.” Winners’ exploits — like software vulnerabilities — are funneled directly into government databases.A leaked trove from i-Soon revealed operations targeting Nepal’s presidential palace, Taiwanese mapping data, Indian immigration systems, and even Thai intelligence. The documents showed disorganization — but also remarkable ambition and global scope.US agencies are scrambling to blunt the impact:But experts say the damage may already be happening. One former intelligence official warned, “We may be building the perfect storm — cutting loose people with secrets and then hoping no one comes calling.”“This isn’t reality TV,” a former intelligence official told CNN. “There are consequences.”",Eight chinese nationals were recently charged in a sprawling cyber espionage campaign.

[Screengrab/X]

The midnight email that changed everything

ICE at the door

Columbia’s silence and a fellow student’s arrest

Branded a 'terrorist sympathizer'

Columbia’s betrayal and a dangerous precedent

An uncertain future

Ranjani Srinivasan , a 37-year-old Indian PhD candidate at Columbia University , never imagined her academic journey would end with a frantic escape to Canada. Pursued by immigration agents, labeled a "" terrorist sympathizer "" by a top US official, and abandoned, she says, by the institution she dedicated years to, Srinivasan now faces an uncertain future.In an interview with Al Jazeera, Srinivasan recounted the 10 harrowing days after her student visa was revoked—an ordeal that led to her fleeing the United States in fear of arrest following accusations from US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem.On March 6, Srinivasan woke up in her Columbia-owned apartment to an email from the US consulate in Chennai informing her that her visa had been canceled. Initially dismissing it as spam, she checked the official immigration portal and found confirmation that her visa, which was renewed months earlier until 2029, was no longer valid.Panicked, she contacted Columbia’s International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO). After hours of silence, the office assured her that her student status (I-20) was still intact and scheduled a Zoom meeting for the next day.Ten minutes into that Zoom call, there was a knock on her door.Al Jazeera reported, men claiming to be immigration agents, who without properly identifying themselves, demanded entry, saying they intended to place her in removal proceedings. Her roommate refused to open the door.“I freaked out. Why is ICE at my door?” Srinivasan recalled. “You live in Columbia housing, a place you’d consider safe. The fact that they entered without a warrant was terrifying.”The ISSO adviser on the call, visibly shocked, muted herself to make frantic calls before providing Srinivasan with a list of lawyers. She said Columbia’s Public Safety advised her not to open the door but offered little else.The next day, on March 8, the agents returned, warning they would keep coming ""every day"" until she was placed in removal proceedings. That same day, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian Green Card holder and protest leader, was arrested from Columbia housing.“That’s when I realized I have no rights in this system,” Srinivasan said. “Columbia knew ICE was operating on campus but seemed uninterested in intervening.”By March 9, Columbia revoked her student status and ordered her to vacate university housing.Srinivasan knew her time in the US was running out and decided not to wait for deportation. With no legal recourse, she packed a single bag—leaving behind her furniture, belongings, and even her cat, Cricket—and fled to Canada on March 11 using a visitor visa she had previously secured for academic workshops and conferences.Three days later, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem posted a grainy airport photo of Srinivasan on X (formerly Twitter), labeling her a ""terrorist sympathizer"" and claiming she had ""self-deported"" using a border control app she had never heard of.“If supporting the idea of human rights or ending a genocide is equated with supporting Hamas, then anyone in proximity to me – without me having done anything – can just be picked up and made an example of,” Srinivasan said.While she had participated in pro-Palestine protests and shared social media posts critical of Israel’s war on Gaza, she insists she was never part of any organized campus group. The US government has yet to specify any charges against her.Columbia’s ISSO spokesperson, Kendall Easley, was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying that the university ""welcomes international students"" but did not address Srinivasan’s claims that the school failed to protect her.Her union, Student Workers of Columbia (UAW Local 2710), condemned the university’s inaction, saying: “Ranjani’s case exposes a dangerous precedent… International students feel disposable—at the mercy of the state, with no protection from Columbia.”Now in Canada, Srinivasan is unsure if she’ll ever return to the US, even if her visa is reinstated. Her parents in India, fearing backlash, temporarily fled their home after Noem’s tweet sparked media frenzy and misinformation.“I spent five years at Columbia, working 100-hour weeks,” she said. “I never expected the institution to let me down. But it did.”","Ranjani srinivasan, a 37-year-old indian phd candidate at columbia university, never imagined her academic journey would end with a frantic escape to canada.

India vs Pakistan: Canadian traveller compares hospitality



Social media reactions on the India vs. Pakistan hospitality debate



Also Read |

India is renowned for its hospitality, encapsulated in the words ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (Guest is God). Yet, not everyone finds this to be true. A new viral video with a Canadian tourist has ignited an interesting controversy about the hospitality of India and Pakistan.Nolan Saumure is not a tourist who travels for fun; he is a vlogger who has traveled to many countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, America, and many more. His wide travel background grants him an extensive viewpoint on how various cultures go about hospitality, and this probably advised his perception.This viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in India and Pakistan. While some might agree with Saumure's view of Pakistan's very open and welcoming culture, others will claim that India's tourist industry has commercialized its way of hospitality. In the end, this argument encapsulates how hospitality is affected by such elements as culture, tourism, and individuals' personal experiences and thus is a complex area deserving of further study.During an Instagram interview with Instagram user @officialnamour, Canadian traveler Nolan Saumure was requested to comment on how hospitable Pakistan and India were. His matter-of-fact response, as prompt as his decision, had sparked online discussion. When directly asked which of the two countries has better hospitality, Saumure answered: ""Pakistan, obviously.""Saumure's brief reply paved the way for general discussions and arguments on the various social networking sites, mainly between individuals coming from both the nations and otherwise. When Saumure was asked to expound on his reasoning, he outlined his rationale. Hospitality in India, he said, is very transactional-oriented. He alleged that Indians in general perceive foreign guests more as customers who are likely to bring in money, not as guests to be greeted with hospitality. In contrast, he portrayed Pakistanis as hospitable, inviting guests to share meals and even welcome them to their homes.""People in India treat you like a walking ATM,"" Saumure said. ""In Pakistan, people invite you over, feed you, and even ask you to stay overnight."" His analogy is meant to depict an extreme contrast between how hospitality is thought about and practiced in both nations.The video soon became viral, receiving more than 4.4 million views and evoking a variety of responses from both sides of the argument.Various individuals identified with Saumure's view, with one of the Instagram users, an African in Dubai, stating, ""Pakistanis are friendlier than Indian people. Pakistan treats you as a friend, Indians treat you as a complete stranger."" Another user, an Indian, simply stated: ""I agree.""Some viewers provided explanations for the difference in hospitality between India and Pakistan. One commenter posited that India's tourism sector is much bigger and more commercialized, which could result in a more transactional attitude towards foreign guests. Pakistan, on the other hand, has fewer foreign tourists, so each guest feels like a special guest.In contrast, there were critics of Saumure's viewpoint among certain users. One such comment wondered why Indians expect ""princess treatment"" from foreigners, citing the historical context of colonial exploitation and wealth looted from India over centuries. Saumure shot back at this criticism by explaining that his preference for not being harassed has nothing to do with expecting ""princess treatment,"" but merely a desire to feel welcome and at ease.",A viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in india and pakistan.

Trump order on Smithsonian aims to cut funding for ‘improper ideology’ programs: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-order-on-smithsonian-aims-to-cut-funding-for-improper-ideology-programs-what-it-means/articleshow/119627593.cms,"Under the new directive:

Vice president JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies from all areas of the institution, including its museums, educational and research centres, and the National Zoo.



The order suggested the potential reinstatement of Confederate statues, which were removed after the police killing of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.



Independence Hall in Philadelphia must undergo improvements before July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the declaration of Independence.



VP Vance will collaborate with the White House budget office to ensure that future funding for the Smithsonian Institution is not allocated to programs that ""degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.""



The Women's History Museum must not ""recognize men as women in any respect,"" according to news agency AP.



What is the Smithsonian Institution ?

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, aimed to reshape the Smithsonian Institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology."" This move falls in line with the administration's efforts to address perceived liberal biases in institutions such as universities and the arts.""Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,"" he said.He specifically mentioned the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, and another Women's History Museum, which is still in development.The President asserted that over the past decade, there has been a ""concerted and widespread"" effort to rewrite American history by replacing ""objective facts"" with a ""distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,"" which he believes, portray the nation's “founding principles” in a negative light.Linda St Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution’s chief spokesperson, declined to comment on the executive order.The Smithsonian Institution, established with funds from British scientist James Smithson, is the world's largest museum, education, and research complex, comprising 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven of these museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.It was set up with funds from James Smithson (1765–1829), a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to create ""at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” On August 10, 1846, the US senate passed the act organizing the Smithsonian Institution, which was signed into law by President James K Polk.Since his appointment Trump has introduced a series of measures. He had, recently, appointed himself as chairman of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the intention of overhauling its programming. Additionally, the administration compelled Columbia University to implement several changes by threatening the withdrawal of federal funding amounting to several hundred million dollars.","President donald trump signed an executive order on thursday, aimed to reshape the smithsonian institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology"" vice president jd vance, who serves on the smithsonian's board of regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies from all areas of the institution.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119627479,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-785910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Another US judge halts Trump’s order banning transgender troops in military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/another-us-judge-halts-trumps-order-banning-transgender-troops-in-military/articleshow/119626746.cms,"A federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, marking the second nationwide injunction against the policy within two weeks. US District Judge Benjamin Settle issued the ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit brought by transgender service members who argued that the ban was discriminatory and would cause irreversible harm to their careers.""Absent an injunction, all transgender service members are likely to suffer the irreparable harm of losing the military service career they have chosen, while otherwise qualified accession plaintiffs will lose the opportunity to serve,"" Settle wrote in his decision.The ruling maintains the military's existing policy on transgender service members, preventing the enforcement of Trump’s executive order issued in January. The order had declared that expressing a gender identity different from one’s assigned sex was incompatible with military service.Settle's decision follows a similar ruling last week by US District Judge Ana Reyes, who also blocked the ban but temporarily put her order on hold pending a government appeal. Additionally, a judge in New Jersey issued a more limited ruling on Monday, preventing the Air Force from removing two transgender service members.Trump’s policy, which was enforced through a directive from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, sought to disqualify transgender individuals from serving unless they obtained special waivers. The Pentagon memo supporting the ban targeted individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria , a condition affecting over 4,000 service members as of last year, according to a senior defence official.The policy has been challenged by transgender rights groups , including the Gender Justice League, as well as active-duty service members. One of the plaintiffs, US Navy Cmdr Emily ""Hawking"" Shilling, has served for over 19 years, including 60 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Settle referenced her case, stating, ""There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness.""The Trump administration had previously argued that the ban was necessary for military discipline and readiness. However, civil rights groups have countered that transgender service members have been serving openly for years without issue.During Trump’s presidency, his administration had reversed a 2016 policy that allowed transgender individuals to serve openly. The Supreme Court later allowed the ban to take effect. However, President Joe Biden rescinded the restriction upon taking office.The latest court rulings signal continued legal challenges to policies affecting transgender military personnel, with ongoing appeals and government arguments likely to shape the future of transgender rights in the US military.",A federal judge in washington state temporarily blocked us president donald trump’s order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military.
