Trump's 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan



Gaza will be transformed into a demilitarized, terror-free zone with no threat to neighbors. The region will be redeveloped to improve the lives of Gazans, AFP reported. If both sides accept, the war will stop immediately, Israeli forces will pull back, and hostages will be prepared for release. Within 72 hours of Israel’s approval, all hostages—alive or deceased—will be returned. After hostages are freed, Israel will release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans detained after October 7, 2023, including women and children. For each deceased Israeli hostage, Israel will return 15 Gazan remains. Hamas members who disarm and commit to peace will be granted amnesty, while others can leave Gaza with safe passage. Full humanitarian aid will immediately flow into Gaza, covering infrastructure repair, hospitals, bakeries, and rubble clearance. Aid delivery will be managed by the UN, Red Crescent, and neutral international agencies, with Rafah crossing opened under agreed terms. Gaza will be run temporarily by a technocratic Palestinian committee, overseen by a new international “Board of Peace” chaired by Trump, until the Palestinian Authority reforms and takes over. An economic plan will be launched to rebuild Gaza with input from global experts, attracting investment and creating jobs. A special economic zone with preferential trade terms will be created for Gaza. No one will be forced to leave Gaza; people may leave or return freely, with incentives to stay and rebuild. Hamas and other factions will have no role in governance. Gaza will be fully demilitarized, with weapons destroyed under international monitoring and buyback programs. Regional partners will guarantee Hamas and other groups comply, ensuring Gaza remains threat-free. A temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF), supported by Arab and global partners, will deploy in Gaza, training Palestinian police and securing borders with Egypt and Israel. Israel will not annex Gaza. As security improves, the IDF will withdraw gradually, handing control to the ISF, except for a limited security perimeter. If Hamas rejects or delays, aid and redevelopment will still proceed in areas controlled by the ISF and free from terror. An interfaith dialogue program will promote tolerance, coexistence, and peace narratives among Israelis and Palestinians. Once Gaza is rebuilt and the Palestinian Authority reforms, conditions may allow progress toward Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood. The US will foster Israel-Palestine talks to set a long-term political framework for peaceful coexistence and prosperity.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday welcomed US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan for Gaza, calling it a ""significant step"" toward ending the conflict.Sharing a post on X, PM Modi said, ""We welcome President Trump's leadership as peace efforts in Gaza make decisive progress. Indications of the release of hostages mark a significant step forward. ""He further underlined that India will ""continue to strongly support all efforts towards a durable and just peace.""The comments come as Trump pushes for a breakthrough in the Gaza crisis, with hopes pinned on the release of hostages and renewed talks between the warring sides.Trump on Friday issued an ultimatum to Hamas to agree to a Gaza peace deal with Israel by Sunday, 6pm (Washington DC time), warning that ""all hell, like no one has ever seen before,"" would break out if the deadline was missed.In a fiery post on Truth Social, Trump declared, ""An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, DC time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.""Trump also urged Palestinians to move out of conflict zones ahead of what he hinted could be intensified strikes if Hamas rejected the deal.The ultimatum follows Trump's announcement of a 20-point Gaza peace plan earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.Talking about the 20-point Gaza plan, he said that the Middle East nations had agreed to a peace plan ""after 3000 years,"" assuring to ""spare the lives of remaining Hamas fighters.""""Great, powerful, and very rich Nations of the Middle East, and the surrounding areas beyond, together with the United States of America, have agreed, with Israel signing on, to PEACE, after 3000 years, in the Middle East.

We will have PEACE in the Middle East one way or the other. The violence and bloodshed will stop. RELEASES THE HOSTAGES, ALL OF THEM, INCLUDING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT ARE DEAD, NOW!"" he added.Hamas further responded to Trump's proposal stating that it agreed ""to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula"" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.","Israel will release 250 prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 gazans detained after october 7, 2023, including women and children.

Khalistani Leader Pannun Cornered: NIA Files New Case After Aide Gosal’s Arrest Over Terror Links

Transnational organised crime is a concern for India & Canada, says govt

NEW DELHI: While Canadian police focus on tackling the Bishnoi syndicate, pro-Khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in Ontario twice within a week. The theatre has stopped screening Hindi movies since. The attacks were carried out on Oct 2 and Sept 25. In the second incident, the suspects fired gunshots to cause a scare.Designated terror group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) released a statement on Friday calling on the Carney govt to ban all “Made In India” films.In the first incident, two masked suspects wearing black clothing attempted to ignite a fire at the theatre’s entrance using flammable liquid from red gas cans, CCTV footage released by Khalistani elements shows. The fire was contained outside, causing moderate damage. This happened at 5.30am on Sept 25.On Oct 2, around 1.50am, a single suspect, described by local police as a heavy-built male wearing black and a face mask, fired multiple shots at the theatre’s entrance doors.Halton Regional Police said they were probing both incidents as targeted attacks.The threatre’s CEO Jeff Knoll linked the attacks to the screening of south Asian films, adding that due to safety concerns, it had halted the screenings of Indian films ‘Kantara: A Legend Chapter 1’ and ‘They Call Him OG’.SFJ chief Pannun claimed “Make in India” was no longer a cultural label but had become a political weapon for Modi’s regime. “Every screening and every product stamped ‘Made in India’ carries the imprint of a violent ideology that is driving India toward a Hindutva totalitarian state,” he said . Allowing Indian films and products into Canadian markets, he warned, was equivalent to opening the door to propaganda that normalises violence against pro-Khalistan Sikhs and undermines the values enshrined in Canada’s Charter.India and Canada had productive talks in the recent NSA-level meeting on advancing the bilateral relationship in areas such as counter terrorism, combating transnational organised crime and intelligence exchanges, said the govt responding to queries on Ottawa’s listing of the Bishnoi gang as a terrorist entity.MEA said security cooperation is an important agenda of continued bilateral collaboration. “Transnational organised crime is a particular concern to both countries. All countries, in fact, must come together to fight this menace,” said MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal. “They agreed to strengthen security cooperation and further reinforce existing mechanisms of engagement.”",Pro-khalistan elements attempted arson at a cinema theatre in ontario twice within a week.

NEW DELHI: Indian govt slammed Pakistan for the ongoing protests in POK, saying Islamabad must be held accountable for its “oppressive approach” and “horrific” human rights violations . Pakistan authorities had on Thursday confirmed that eight people had died in four days of violent protests in the region that India maintains is illegally occupied by Pakistan.According to a Reuters report from Islamabad, only limited information has so far reached the outside world about the full extent of the protests, which broke out when thousands of people from nearby towns converged on regional capital Muzaffarabad on Monday.“We have seen reports on protests in several areas of Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir, including brutalities by Pakistani forces on innocent civilians. We believe that it is a natural consequence of Pakistan’s oppressive approach and its systemic plundering of resources from these territories, which remain under its forcible and illegal occupation,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal at a media briefing, while reiterating that POK was and will always remain an integral part of India.India maintains that Pakistan has been in illegal occupation of parts of Indian UTs of J&K and Ladakh and has consistently called upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal and forcible occupation.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif Thursday expressed ""deep concern"" over the deteriorating law and order situation in POK. A high-level federal govt delegation rushed to Muzaffarabad on Thursday, following Sharif’s instructions, to hold talks with the protesters in an effort to end the unrest in the region.The development came following a three-day strike by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), prompted by the failure of talks between the JKJAAC, representatives of POK, and the federal govt to address the issues raised by the protesters. At least six civilians and three police personnel have been killed during the demonstrations in the region, The News reported.",India maintains that pakistan has been in illegal occupation of parts of indian uts of j&k and ladakh.

NEW DELHI: IAF destroyed 9-10 Pakistani fighters like US-origin F-16s and Chinese JF- 17s, as well as at least two special aircraft, if the ‘kills’ in the air and ground are both taken into account during Operation Sindoor , Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said on Friday, while rejecting Islamabad’s counter-claims as “manohar kahaniyan (fanciful stories)”.While elaborating on his earlier remarks on the losses suffered by Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10, ACM Singh also said the move by terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed to relocate their larger camps and hideouts deep inside Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was “expected” after their headquarters at Muridke and Bahawalpur were struck by IAF.“Now they (LeT, JeM) will probably build smaller structures instead of big structures. But if intelligence is available, then we have the capability to strike deep inside any of their hideouts with absolutely accurate targeting. We can destroy them and their hideouts,” the IAF chief said at a press conference in the run-up to IAF Day on Oct 8.He, however, refused to be drawn into the number of IAF fighters downed during the strikes on the nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK on May 7 as well as Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan’s remarks that India rectified its “tactical mistakes” after suffering the initial losses.IAF conducted the May 7 strikes without the requisite suppression or destruction of enemy air defences because the aim was to target only terrorist infrastructure on that day. Moreover, it was not anticipated that Pakistani jets of Chinese-origin would be armed with PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles with ranges over 200km.ACM Singh, on his part, said, “If they (Pakistan) think they shot down 15 of my jets, let them think it. I hope they’re convinced about it, and they will cater for 15 less aircraft in my inventory when they come to fight again. Why should I talk about it?”In the subsequent strikes on Pakistan airbases and other military infrastructure, ACM Singh there was clear evidence through satellite imagery of the destruction of at least four radar sites, two command and control centres and a surface-to-air missile system as well as runways being damaged at the Rahim Yar Khan and Sargodha airbases.Then, the UAV hangar at Sukkur, the AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) aircraft hangar at Bholari, and the F-16 hangar at Jacobabad in Pakistan were also damaged in the strikes. “We have signs of one C-130 class of aircraft and possibly an AEW&C... and at least four to five fighter aircraft, most likely F-16s (being destroyed),” the IAF chief said.Separately, IAF’s surface-to-air missile systems like the S-400 shot down a large special mission aircraft, either an ELINT (electronic intelligence) or an AEW&C, at a distance of over 300km in the “longest such kill ever achieved”, as well as “at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters in the F-16 and JF-17-class” in the air.“We made Pakistan reach a stage where they had to ask for a ceasefire on May 10. We took a call as a nation to terminate those hostilities because our own objectives were met. I think this is something that the world needs to learn from us,” ACM Singh said. “Have you seen a single picture where something fell on any of our airbases, something hit us, a hangar was destroyed, or anything like that? We showed so many pictures of their places. So, their narrative is ‘manohar kahaniyan’. Let them be happy, after all, they also have to show something to their audience to save their reputation,” he said.Op Sindoor demonstrated IAF’s capability to “deliver catastrophic firepower with precision” in one of the most decisive uses of air power in India’s history, he added.","Iaf destroyed 9-10 pakistani fighters like us-origin f-16s and chinese jf- 17s, as well as at least two special aircraft during operation sindoor.

JAISALMER: Pakistan must stop supporting terrorism if it wants to “remain on the world map”, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi declared Friday, warning that India will not show the restraint it exercised during Operation Sindoor.Dwivedi’s address to soldiers near the Pakistan border in Anupgarh of Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar district followed a visit to nearby Ghadsana, located directly opposite Pakistan’s Bahawalpur region where military facilities were targeted during Operation Sindoor, launched after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.“Had India not unearthed this evidence (of involvement in the Pahalgam strike), Pakistan would have hidden all of it,” Dwivedi said.The Army chief pointed out that nine terrorist facilities located in Pakistan were destroyed during the operation, resulting in more than 100 Pakistani soldiers and numerous terrorists being killed, and warned that “further provocations would not go unanswered”.Dwivedi emphasised the precision of Indian strikes and focus on minimising civilian casualties. “India took care to avoid civilian casualties and only targeted terrorist hideouts, training centres and masterminds.”The Army chief called for heightened readiness and vigilance among Indian soldiers to counter the cross-border terror threat. “Keep yourselves fully prepared now... if God wants, the opportunity will come soon.”Dwivedi also highlighted the importance of modernisation and technological advancement of our forces, stressing the Army’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technology, including unmanned aerial systems and counter-capabilities.Dwivedi honoured three personnel in Sriganganagar for “exemplary contributions” during Op Sindoor—Commandant Prabhakar Singh, Major Ritesh Kumar and Havildar Mohit Gaira. He also visited forward areas, including Bikaner military station, to review operational preparedness and met local communities near the border, calling them “not ordinary civilians but soldiers”.","Pakistan must stop supporting terrorism if it wants to ‘remain on the world map’, says army chief.

Undertrails as % of total inmates

Occupancy & duration of stay

Around three-fourth of all prison inmates in India in 2023 were undertrials, according to the latest report released by NCRB. The numbers are staggering: India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted — they are on trial.But this is actually an improvement over the previous years. The percentage of incarcerated undertrials in 2021 was 77%. This fell to 76% in 2022, and then to 74% in 2023.Of these undertrials, 150 died while in jail; 64% of them were suicides.The share of undertrials in jail keeps fluctuating, but an analysis of the data for the past 25 years shows it has never dropped below 65%. Several studies have suggested that delays in investigation, shortage of judges, and lack of access to legal aid because of poverty are the main reasons why undertrials end up spending a long time in prisons. There are 3.6 crore pending criminal cases in district courts, 17.5 lakh cases in high courts and 14,667 cases in the Supreme Court.In answer to a Parliament question last Feb, it was revealed that the judge-to-population ratio in India is estimated at 21 judges per million population, which is less than half of what the Law Commission recommended in its 120th report.With so many undertrials in jail, our prisons have also become overcrowded. Although the occupancy rate has improved from 131% in 2022 to 121% in 2023, jails have more inmates than their sanctioned capacity and this has been the case for the past 25 years. Twenty years ago, the situation was even worse as the occupancy rate had touched 145% in 2005. Since then, jails have been equipped to handle 1.9 lakh more prisoners, but that has clearly not been enough.","India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted.

Rahul Gandhi - Conferencia El futuro es hoy

'Demonetisation, GST destroying small, medium businesses'



'Cowardice at heart of RSS-BJP ideology'



'Rahul wants to fight Indian state!'



NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , accused the BJP-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on Indian democracy” during an interaction at EIA University in Colombia. The BJP hit back, calling him a “Leader of Propaganda” and criticising him for ""once again"" denigrating Indian democracy on a foreign platform.""The single biggest risk is the attack on democracy that is taking place in India because India has multiple religions, multiple traditions, multiple languages. And India actually is a conversation between all its people and different traditions, different religions, different ideas require space. And that the best method for creating that space is the democratic system. And currently there is a wholesale attack on the democratic system in India,"" Rahul said during a recent interaction with students.Contrasting Indian political system with that of China's, he said, ""This other big risk is risk between different conceptions, different parts of the country, right? Some 16, 17 different languages, different religions. So allowing these different traditions to thrive, giving them space to express themselves is very important for a country like India. We can't do what China does, which is suppress people and run authoritarian system.Our design just will not accept that.""""Most of the people, for example, who are creating polarisation in the US with Mr Trump are those who lost their jobs because of manufacturing. China has demonstrated to the world how you can manage production in a non-democratic setup, but we cannot do that; we are a democratic setup. The challenge is whether we can develop manufacturing like China but within a democratic setup,"" he added.Targeting the central government's policies, including demonetisation and GST, Rahul said that these economic policies ""destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy.""""The Government of India brought two policies - first, the demonetisation of our currency, which essentially destroyed small and medium businesses and allowed very large monopolies to control a big section of our economy; and second, GST, which was again designed to harm medium and small businesses. We believe that supporting these small businesses is the way forward for entrepreneurship, and that’s the difference between us and those in power who believe that a few monopolies should control the economy,"" he said.""In India, we have a huge level of corruption at the centralised level. Three or four businesses are taking over the whole economy, having a direct relationship with the Prime Minister, and it is rampant in India,"" he added.Citing past statements by foreign minister S Jaishankar about China and Hindu ideologue VD Savarkar about beating up a Muslim man, Rahul said that ""cowardice was at heart of RSS-BJP ideology.""""This is the nature of BJP-RSS. If you notice a statement of the foreign minister, he said, 'China is much more powerful than us. How can I pick a fight with them?' At the heart of the ideology is cowardice,"" he said.""In his book, Savarkar has written that once he and his few friends beat up a Muslim man, and they felt very happy that day. If five people beat up a single individual, which makes one of them happy, it is cowardice. This is RSS ideology, to beat weak people,"" he added.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul for making such statements abroad.""Once again Rahul Gandhi behaves like LoP - Leader of Propaganda Goes abroad and attacks Indian Democracy! After all he wants to fight Indian state! Sometimes Demands US UK should intervene into our affairs and now this From Sena to Judiciary to Sanvidhan to Sanatan!"" he said in a post on X.Moreover, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari accused ""Gandhi-Vadra family"" of keeping India ""poor.""""Rahul Gandhi is anti-India. The one who hates India and its progress can speak such things on foreign soil that India can't be a leader. The Gandhi-Vadra family kept India poor due to such a mindset. When they see that India has emerged as a global leader and a four trillion-dollar economy under PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi is attacking India's progress and its democracy out of jealousy and disgust,"" Bhandari told ANI.""This makes it clear that Rahul Gandhi's remote control is in foreign hands. Those who don't want India to progress push Rahul Gandhi to say such things. He is not a political opponent, but leader of opposing India. He is against India's unity and integrity. 140 crore Indians are witnessing Rahul Gandhi's attempt to defame India from foreign soil,"" he added.Ravi Shankar Prasad also took aim at Gandhi saying that instead of greeting Indians on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he chose to ""speak against India.""“Rahul Gandhi is abroad. It would have been better if, on the occasion of Vijayadashami, he had extended greetings to the people of the country. But instead, he chooses to speak against India. Rahul Gandhi has developed a habit of defaming the nation and questioning the freedoms enjoyed by its people, and that too while on foreign soil,"" he said.""He constantly makes false allegations against Prime Minister Modi, abuses him without shame, and claims abroad that there is no freedom of speech in India. Everything Rahul Gandhi says is baseless. When he is abroad, he says there is no democracy in India. While overseas, he insults India,"" he added.Gandhi is on a four-day South America tour, the timing of which, has already been questioned by the BJP.","Rahul gandhi accused the bjp-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on indian democracy” during an interaction at eia university in colombia.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath singh warns pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive sir creek region.

Kayvon Thibodeaux could be traded as Giants assess defensive line depth

San Francisco 49ers face urgent need for a top pass rusher after Nick Bosa injury

Kayvon Thibodeaux, the New York Giants’ defensive end, is reportedly attracting interest from the San Francisco 49ers. Since being chosen fifth overall in 2022, Thibodeaux, 24, has demonstrated bursts of dominance. After star pass rusher Nick Bosa sustained a season-ending knee injury in Week 3, the 49ers, though, find themselves in serious difficulty. To keep their pass rush current, the 49ers need a great defensive end. According to sources, San Francisco could make a trade offer if the Giants decide to make Thibodeaux available.The New York Giants have several talented defenders, including Brian Burns and rookie Abdul Carter. While Thibodeaux has been productive, some experts believe the Giants could consider trading him if the right offer comes in.Reports indicate they may seek a draft pick or a player able to instantly help the team (Yahoo Sports). Through the first four games of the 2025 season, Thibodeaux has eight quarterback hits and 2.5 sacks. Having several choices on their defensive line, the Giants might use a trade to round off their team and cover other important areas.San Francisco’s defense has been strong, but losing Nick Bosa leaves a big gap. Bryce Huff and other players have stepped up, but the team still needs an elite edge presence. Adding Thibodeaux could immediately fill that void and help the 49ers remain Super Bowl contenders.Financially, San Francisco will need to manage its salary cap carefully, as Bosa’s contract already occupies a large portion.Also Read: “He Gets Mad At Me”: Travis Kelce’s Latest Clash With Andy Reid Fuels Chiefs Drama After Ravens Game According to the San Francisco Chronicle , the team may need a creative trade structure to make the move possible.

Former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik is once again in the headlines, this time over reports that his marriage with actor Sana Javed may be going through a rough patch. As per reports, the couple is reportedly headed for divorce, though neither Malik nor Sana has made any official statement so far.The news has sparked widespread speculation on social media, with fans pointing to a recent video that showed the two maintaining distance in public. In the clip, Malik was seen signing autographs while his wife kept her face turned away.The lack of interaction between them fueled rumours of a possible strain in their relationship.Shoaib Malik and Sana Javed had announced their marriage in January 2024, surprising many across Pakistan and India. The wedding came soon after the confirmation of Malik’s divorce from Indian tennis star Sania Mirza , with whom he was married for 14 years. The cross-border marriage had once been celebrated widely before Sania’s family confirmed in early 2024 that the couple had “quietly divorced a few months ago.”The timing of Malik’s wedding to Javed had also raised questions, with reports suggesting that their relationship might have begun earlier, though neither addressed these claims publicly. Both Malik and Javed faced criticism online at the time of their private nikah ceremony, but the couple remained silent about the chatter.Malik and Mirza share a son, Izyan, who lives with his mother in Dubai. While Sania has stayed away from making public remarks about her former husband’s personal life, the series of developments around Malik’s third marriage has continued to attract attention.Before tying the knot with Sania, the former Pakistan cricketer was married to Ayesha Siddiqui for 8 years.For now, thereports of Malik and Javed’s alleged split are yet to receive confirmation or denial from either party.",Shoaib malik and sana javed announced their marriage in january 2024.

Hamas on Friday announced it had agreed to release all Israeli hostages, alive or deceased, under the terms of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza proposal, and expressed readiness to immediately enter mediated talks to finalise the details, reported news agency Reuters.In the statement, Hamas said it agreed ""to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal"" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.The announcement came shortly after Trump issued an ultimatum to Hamas, warning that unless it agreed to a peace deal with Israel by Sunday 6 pm Washington DC time, unprecedented consequences would follow.“An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time. Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.The US president urged Palestinians to leave Gaza’s conflict-hit areas, which have faced continuous Israeli bombardment since the October 7 attacks.“I am asking that all innocent Palestinians immediately leave this area of potentially great future death for safer parts of Gaza. Everyone will be well cared for by those that are waiting to help. Fortunately for Hamas, however, they will be given one last chance!” he said.Trump also highlighted his 20-point Gaza peace plan, which he claimed had been agreed upon by Israel, the US and regional powers. He described it as a historic breakthrough that would end centuries of bloodshed in the region.“Great, powerful, and very rich Nations of the Middle East, and the surrounding areas beyond, together with the United States of America, have agreed, with Israel signing on, to PEACE, after 3000 years, in the Middle East. THIS DEAL ALSO SPARES THE LIVES OF ALL REMAINING HAMAS FIGHTERS! The details of the document are known to the WORLD, and it is a great one for ALL! We will have PEACE in the Middle East one way or the other. The violence and bloodshed will stop. RELEASES THE HOSTAGES, ALL OF THEM, INCLUDING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT ARE DEAD, NOW!” Trump declared.UN also welcomed Hamas’s announcement and expressed encouragement over Hamas’s readiness to release hostages and engage in negotiations. “The Secretary-General welcomes and is encouraged by the statement issued by Hamas announcing its readiness to release hostages and to engage,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. He urged all parties to seize this opportunity to end the tragic conflict and protect civilians.On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale surprise attack on Israel, marking the most significant escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.The assault commenced during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and involved a barrage of over 4,000 rockets, along with coordinated incursions by land, air, and sea. Hamas militants breached the Gaza-Israel barrier at 119 locations, infiltrating 21 Israeli communities, including Be'eri, Kfar Aza, and Alumim.The attackers targeted military installations and civilian areas, resulting in the deaths of at least 1,195 individuals, comprising 736 Israeli civilians, 79 foreign nationals, and 379 security personnel. Additionally, approximately 250 individuals were taken hostage to Gaza, including civilians and soldiers. The assault also led to widespread destruction, with numerous homes and infrastructure damaged or destroyed.This unprecedented attack has significantly intensified the ongoing conflict, leading to severe humanitarian consequences and drawing widespread international attention.","Hamas agrees to release all israeli hostages, alive or deceased, under the terms of us president donald trump’s gaza proposal.

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The us government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked congress failed to pass a funding measure.

Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published Friday, Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.The Taiwan-born executive, who has frequently cited his own experience as an embodiment of the American dream, emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said on the podcast.Huang agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the substantial fee tilts the playing field toward large technology companies that can easily afford visa sponsorships, placing startups at a competitive disadvantage. He warned that the policy could prompt increased investment outside the US and affect global talent flows.The Nvidia chief also addressed concerns about Chinese researchers, separating America's competition with China as a nation from policies affecting Chinese individuals. ""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he said.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March.

Poll Do you agree with Jensen Huang's view that American companies should compete openly in China? Yes, it's beneficial for both countries No, it poses risks to national security

China-US geopolitical tensions





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","China 'nanoseconds behind' america in chipmaking industry, says nvidia ceo jensen huang.
