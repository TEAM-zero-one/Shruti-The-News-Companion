Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.W hen Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former uk prime minister rishi sunak is returning to goldman sachs as a senior adviser.

"US vs Brazil: Trump slaps 50% tariff; President Lula hits back, says 'will not accept tutelage'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/brazil-vs-us-trump-slaps-50-tariff-president-lula-hits-back-says-will-not-accept-tutelage/articleshow/122353841.cms,"NEW DELHI: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday (local time) warned of retaliation and condemned “tutelage” after United States President Donald Trump announced a steep 50 per cent tariff on ""any and all"" imports from Brazil. The move, widely seen as linked to Trump’s continued support for coup-accused former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, has triggered a diplomatic standoff between the two countries.Reacting strongly to Trump’s remarks and trade decision, Lula on X said, ""Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage.” He added that “any unilateral tariff increases will be addressed in accordance with Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law.""Lula also addressed the larger context of judicial independence and foreign interference in Bolsonaro’s ongoing trial. “The judicial proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d'état fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil’s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national institutions,” he wrote.The announcement came shortly after Brazil summoned the US ambassador in Brasília to protest a statement by the American embassy describing Bolsonaro as a victim of “political persecution.”Bolsonaro, who lost the 2022 presidential election to Lula, is on trial for allegedly plotting to remain in power after the defeat.President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly defended Bolsonaro, issued a fiery post earlier this week on his platform Truth Social: “LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE. They have done nothing but come after him, day after day, night after night, month after month, year after year!” Lula called this an unacceptable intrusion into Brazil’s internal affairs, stating firmly: “No one is above the law.”The 50 percent tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, is part of Trump’s broader strategy to rebuild America’s industrial base. In his announcement, he linked copper to national security and defence: “Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many. ”Calling copper the “second most used material by the department of defense,” Trump blamed past US leaders for weakening the sector and criticised the Biden administration’s policies as “thoughtless” and “stupid.” According to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, the administration has already collected $100 billion through tariffs and aims to reach $300 billion by December.In a letter to President Lula, Trump escalated the dispute, calling the Bolsonaro trial an “international disgrace” and warning of additional trade measures if Brazil retaliated. He also announced a formal review of Brazil’s trade practices. Although Trump has recently issued tariff threats to several US trade partners, Brazil had not been previously targeted. It is currently the second-largest exporter of steel to the United States, after Canada.Lula, in his X post, also addressed Trump’s claim about the US trade deficit with Brazil, saying it was misleading. “The claim regarding a US trade deficit in its commercial relationship with Brazil is inaccurate. Statistics from the US government itself show a surplus of $410 billion in the trade of goods and services with Brazil over the past 15 years,” he said.He further commented on foreign companies operating in Brazil: “All companies—whether domestic or foreign—must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.” He warned that “freedom of expression must not be confused with aggression or violent practices,” especially in the context of digital platforms and content moderation.The diplomatic tension also played out at the BRICS summit hosted by Brazil this week, where member nations criticised Trump’s tariff moves and US military actions in Iran. Trump responded by threatening an additional 10 percent tariff on all BRICS-aligned countries, accusing them of launching “insidious attacks on Free Elections.”On Wednesday, the US embassy in Brasília reinforced Trump’s position, stating: “Jair Bolsonaro and his family have been strong partners of the United States. The political persecution against him, his family, and his followers is shameful and disrespects Brazil’s democratic traditions.”Despite being barred from contesting future elections due to spreading falsehoods about Brazil’s electoral system, Bolsonaro remains a central figure in the country’s politics. He thanked Trump for standing up for “peace, justice and liberty.” Trump, in turn, claimed Bolsonaro remains the frontrunner for Brazil’s next election — a race he legally cannot enter as of now.As the cases around both Bolsonaro and Trump unfold in parallel, the escalating rhetoric and retaliatory economic threats between the US and Brazil are drawing global attention. Lula concluded his X post with a broader message: “Sovereignty, respect and the unwavering defense of the interests of the Brazilian people are the values that guide our relationship with the world.”","Brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva warned of retaliation and condemned ""tutelage"" after united states president donald trump announced a steep 50 per cent tariff on ""any and all"" imports from brazil.

Yes, I fully support it. No, I do not support it.

NEW DELHI: More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday, potentially disrupting key services across India, according to a joint forum of central trade unions.The strike, described as a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’, has been called by a forum of 10 central trade unions and their associates to protest against what they term “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the government”.“Preparations have been taken up in earnest by unions in all sectors of the formal and informal/unorganised economy” and urged supporters to make the strike a “grand success"", said the forum in a statement.“All India Trade Union Congress’s Amarjeet Kaur said, “More than 25 crore workers are expected to take part in the strike. Farmers and rural workers will also join the protest across the country.” Harbhajan Singh Sidhu of Hind Mazdoor Sabha added, “Banking, postal, coal mining, factories, state transport services will be affected due to the strike.”The forum said it had earlier submitted a 17-point charter of demands to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya but received no concrete response.It also alleged that the government had not conducted the annual labour conference for the past decade and was instead pushing through four labour codes that would weaken collective bargaining, cripple union activity, and favour employers in the name of “ease of doing business”.It further claimed that economic policies were deepening unemployment, raising prices of essential commodities, suppressing wages, and reducing expenditure on education, health, and civic amenities, thereby widening inequality and burdening the poor, lower-income groups, and the middle class.The statement added, “The government has abandoned the welfare state status of the country and is working in the interest of foreign and Indian corporates, and it is so evident from its policies being pursued vigorously.”The unions are also protesting against the privatisation of public sector enterprises, outsourcing, contractual employment, and casualisation of the workforce. They claim that the four labour codes passed in Parliament were designed to “suppress and cripple the trade union movement, increase working hours, snatch workers’ right to collective bargaining, right to strike, and decriminalise violation of labour laws by employers. ”“We are demanding from the government to address unemployment, recruitments against sanctioned posts, creation of more jobs, increase in days and remuneration of MGNREGA workers and enactment of similar legislation for urban areas. But the government is busy imposing ELI (Employment Linked Incentive) scheme to incentivise employers instead,” the statement said.It also alleged that instead of hiring young professionals, government departments were increasingly recruiting retired personnel, as seen in Railways, NMDC Ltd, steel sector, and education services, a move the unions say is harmful to a country where 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 35 and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Unions from NMDC Ltd, non-coal minerals, steel, state government departments, and other public sector enterprises have also served notices for participation in the strike.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a joint front of agricultural workers’ unions have also extended support to the strike and announced large-scale mobilisation in rural areas.Similar nationwide strikes were observed by trade unions on November 26, 2020; March 28-29, 2022; and February 16, 2023.","More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike.

Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,200km border with Tibet, not China, chief minister Pema Khandu declared Wednesday in a surgical swipe at Beijing for repeatedly laying claim to the northeastern state, and also creating what he called a ticking ""water bomb"" in the form of the world's largest dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra in India) river.""Officially, yes, Tibet is under China now. That can't be ruled out... but originally we shared a border with Tibet,"" he told PTI in Delhi on his way back from the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday celebration in Dharamshala.""In Arunachal Pradesh, we share three international boundaries - with Bhutan approximately 150km, with Tibet... and on the eastern side, with Myanmar approximately 550km.""Khandu, in his third consecutive term as CM and credited with strengthening BJP's hold on the state, made the remarks while seeking to ""correct"" the interviewer the moment he referred to Arunachal Pradesh bordering China.Pointing to China's ""forcible"" occupation of Tibet in 1950, Khandu said that if one looked at India's map, ""none of the Indian states directly shares borders with China"".The CM's statement comes amid China's intensified bid to stamp its authority on the Dalai Lama's succession. Union minister and fellow Arunachal Pradesh native Kiren Rijiju, said recently that the decision on who should be the Dalai Lama's successor should be solely his and in accordance with established Tibetan Buddhist convention.No government, including China's communist regime, should have a say, he said.On the dam China is building on the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra, Khandu warned that the project poses an “existential threat” to Arunachal and its neighbouring northeastern states. He termed it “a bigger issue” than anything else other than the Chinese “military threat” hanging over the region.Khandu said Beijing not being a signatory to any international water treaty meant it “cannot be trusted”. “No one knows what they might do... Suppose the dam is built and they suddenly release water, our entire Siang belt would be destroyed. The Adi tribe and similar groups would suffer devastating effects,” he said. The CM said that after discussions with the Union government, Arunachal Pradesh conceived the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project as a bulwark against China's intentions. “Since we cannot make China see reason, it is better that we focus on our own defence mechanisms and preparations,” he told PTI.","Arunachal pradesh shares a 1,200km border with tibet, not china, chief minister pema khandu declared.

Poll What aspect of India-Namibia relations do you find most promising? Strategic cooperation in defence, minerals & technology Cultural and conservation partnerships like the cheetah project

PM Modi receives Namibia’s highest honour

NEW DELHI: India and Namibia discussed enhancing ties in defence, maritime security, digital technology and UPI, energy and critical minerals as PM Modi held a bilateral meeting with President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah in Windhoek during the final leg of his five-nation tour.Addressing Namibia's Parliament, PM Modi also laid out India's vision for Africa - freedom to future - and said India sought to cooperate, not compete, and not take but to build and grow together.""Let us create a future defined not by power, but by partnership, not by dominance, but by dialogue, not by exclusion, but by equity,"" he said.""We believe that Africa must not be just a source of raw materials. Africa must lead in value creation and sustainable growth. Let our children not only inherit the freedom we fought for, but the future we will build together,"" the PM said. Some of the remarks by Modi are seen as a subtle dig at China, which has a vast presence in the continent, at a time many African countries are looking to diversify their partnerships.According to an Indian statement, Modi thanked Namibia for its strong support and solidarity extended to the people of India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.They agreed to strengthen the global fight against terrorism. They also committed to work together to amplify the voice of the Global South.PM Modi thanked Nandi-Ndaitwah for Namibia's support in the cheetah conservation project in India and invited Namibia to join International Big Cat Alliance. ""They (cheetahs) are happy and have adapted well in their new home. They have grown in numbers as well.

Prince Andrew becomes the only name on Epstein's list







As the US government finally closed the Epstein case announcing that the convicted sex offender who died in 2019 by suicide did not have a client list, Prince Andrew who was linked to the case is now free to travel abroad. According to reports, there was no embargo on Prince Andrew but he imposed a travel ban on himself as he was stated that he could be arrested if he travels outside the UK.The 65-year-old Royal family member who lost all his titles after he was accused of sexually exploiting a minor at Epstein island left the UK once in the last six years. “He has been abroad once since the scandal erupted,” a source told the Sun.“He has always been very nervous about going abroad and felt he’d always be looking over his shoulder as he could be subject to civil action or at worst, being arrested.”“Hopefully with this out of the way it means he can at least leave the country,” the insider said. “What’s he supposed to do with the rest of his life? He hasn’t been convicted of any crime and can’t sit around doing nothing at Royal Lodge forever.”Before the lawsuit, he was known to be trotting the globe.Virginia Giuffre, the woman who mysteriously died by suicide earlier this year, sued Prince Andrew and claimed that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17, after she was trafficked by Epstein.In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew's attorneys reached an agreement to settle the case in exchange of a hefty amount of money but Prince Andrew denied any wrongdoing. He said he did not even remember meeting Giuffre, though his photo with Giuffre surfaced online.In 2020, the FBI had asked the UK Home Office to assist it in bringing Andrew in for questioning, but the investigation was put on hold in 2024 for reasons unknown. Andrew admitted that he had associations with Epstein but he cut those in 2010.

Khalil was also denied a temporary release when his wife gave birth to their first child. Last month, Khalil was released from federal immigration detention after being held for more than 100 days without being charged with a crime.Khalil's attorneys accused the government of subjecting him to false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the claim filed Thursday.""These harms are the result of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's ad hoc and conclusory determination"" that Khalil's presence in the US poses a foreign policy threat, the attorneys said, adding that if Khalil wins the case and the administration pays him, then he would share the money to help others who are similarly being targeted by the Trump administration.""He would accept, in lieu of payment, an official apology and abandonment of the administration's unconstitutional policy,"" the attorneys said.Khalil could still be deported as the case is going on.“They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,” Khalil said. “Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.”Khalil also accused the government of terrorizing him to which the administration reacted and said it was Khalil who terrorized Jewish students.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced sweeping new measures aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants from accessing taxpayer-funded education and health care programs, according to The New York Post. The move, officials claim, could save approximately $40 billion.Multiple federal departments, including Education, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, and Health and Human Services (HHS)- issued separate statements underscoring the policy shift. The Department of Health and Human Services described the change as a “significant policy shift” designed to ensure that public benefit programs are reserved for US citizens and legal residents.“Taxpayer-funded program benefits intended for the American people should not be diverted to subsidize illegal aliens,” the HHS statement noted.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said President Donald Trump is preparing to launch the largest-ever “mass deportation operation,” fulfilling a key campaign promise.“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.There will be no amnesty, only deportations of violent, criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden welcomed into the country,” said Jackson as quoted by Axios.Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the administration would block undocumented immigrants from accessing federally supported education programs.“Hardworking American taxpayers will no longer foot the bill for illegal aliens participating in our career, technical, or adult education programs,” she said. “These funds will be reserved for citizens and those who have entered legally and meet federal eligibility criteria.”Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that states would also be expected to prevent undocumented migrants from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.“For too long, the generosity of the American taxpayer has been abused by faulty interpretations of the 1996 welfare reform law,” Rollins said, referencing the Clinton-era Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA).The administration has moved to reinterpret PRWORA, tightening the definition of “federal public benefits.” Under the new interpretation, several HHS programs—including Head Start, the early childhood education initiative—now fall under the restricted category.Andrew Gradison, acting assistant secretary at HHS, said the change “puts American families first by ensuring taxpayer-funded benefits are reserved for eligible individuals.”In a cabinet meeting earlier this week, Trump reiterated his hardline stance: “There will be no amnesty. What we’re doing is getting rid of criminals. But we are doing a work program,” he said, suggesting some undocumented workers could remain if their employers assume responsibility for them.In line with the broader crackdown, the administration has also opened a new migrant detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” located in the swamps of Florida.","The trump administration announced sweeping new measures aimed at restricting undocumented immigrants from accessing taxpayer-funded education and health care programs.

The decision was conveyed in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Thursday, marking the latest in a string of over 20 similar communications Trump has issued since Monday.The move follows escalating tensions over trade policies, with Trump accusing Canada of retaliatory actions. ""It is a Great Honor for me to send you this letter in that it demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship, and the fact that the United States of America has agreed to continue working with Canada, despite Canada having financially retaliated against the United States.” Trump said in the letter, shared on his Truth Social platform. “Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a tariff of 35 per cent on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs,"" he further announced.Trump blamed Canada for these measures saying, ""As you will recall, the United States imposed Tariffs on Canada to deal with our Nation’s Fentanyl crisis, which is caused, in part, by Canada’s failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our Country.

""Further specifying the terms, the US President also added in his letter addressed to Canada PM Mark Carney, ""As you are aware, there will be no Tariff if Canada, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States and, in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely — In other words, in a matter of weeks.

A case that could shake the culture of Canadian hockey

The defense pushes back while public pressure builds



The long-anticipated sexual assault trial involving five former members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior hockey team has reached its final chapter, with a verdict expected July 24. The case, unfolding in London, Ontario, has gripped the nation, not just for the high-profile nature of the accused—Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, and Callan Foote—but for the disturbing allegations that expose a deeper cultural reckoning within Canadian elite sports.All five players have pleaded not guilty to the charges, with McLeod facing an additional count of being a party to the offense. The complainant, whose identity remains protected by a publication ban, testified that she was sexually assaulted in a hotel room after what began as consensual sex with McLeod.Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham didn’t mince words in her closing argument, alleging that McLeod “set up” the young woman by texting teammates to join him in his hotel room for group sex—without her knowledge or consent. Cunningham cited text messages sent by McLeod offering a “three-way quick” and referencing a “gummer”—a slang term for oral sex.“She did not voluntarily agree to the sexual acts,” Cunningham insisted, portraying the woman as shocked and disoriented when multiple players entered the room. She urged the court to reject the defense’s claims that the complainant had initiated the group activity, calling those arguments unsubstantiated and contradicted by her consistent testimony.Only Carter Hart testified in his defense, while the others leaned on past police interviews. The defense attempted to paint the complainant as unreliable, suggesting her claims were influenced by a civil suit that had already been settled.However, the Crown countered with witness testimony from two teammates, Boris Katchouk and Taylor Raddysh, who recalled seeing the woman fully covered and uninviting when they briefly entered the room.Also Read: Evgeny Kuznetsov snubs NHL tryouts, claims he's too good to be tested as fans call it arrogant Justice Maria Carroccia now faces the daunting task of delivering a verdict in a case that has ignited national outrage and reignited questions about the accountability mechanisms in place for professional athletes.

The Patriots were in deep trouble, and Donald Trump was ready to buy

Donald Trump’s USFL history turned NFL owners against him

The Patriots were sold—and an NFL dynasty was born

Long before he was president or a polarizing political figure, Donald Trump came close to becoming an NFL team owner. In 1988, he had his sights set on the New England Patriots, a franchise in financial chaos following a disastrous investment by its owners, the Sullivan family. Trump appeared poised to swoop in and save the day—but the NFL had other plans.In the late 1980s, the Patriots were a struggling franchise teetering on the edge. The Sullivan family, desperate after losing millions on a failed Jacksons concert tour investment, began looking for a buyer. Donald Trump quickly stepped up and secured exclusive negotiating rights. He even promised to keep the team in New England, which reassured fans and local leadership.Everything looked like it was lining up for Trump. He had the money. He had the access. But he didn’t have the support of the other NFL owners.To understand why the deal fell apart, you have to rewind to Trump's role in the downfall of the USFL, a short-lived league that tried to challenge the NFL. In 1983, Trump bought the New Jersey Generals and pushed the USFL to go head-to-head with the NFL by moving to a fall schedule. He also led the league into an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.The USFL technically won—but was awarded just $3 in damages. The league collapsed shortly after, and most NFL owners blamed Trump. So when he came knocking again in 1988, they weren’t interested.According to Boston.com, many NFL executives “loathed” Trump. Despite having a two-week exclusive window, he never submitted a formal bid, likely realizing he wouldn’t get the required votes from existing owners. Only a few supported him, including former Browns owner Art Modell—but it wasn’t nearly enough.Trump walked away, and the Patriots were eventually sold to Victor Kiam for $84 million. Six years later, Robert Kraft bought the team and led them into the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era that would define modern NFL dominance.Trump would try again in 2014, this time with the Buffalo Bills—but lost out to the Pegula family. He also passed on buying the Dallas Cowboys in the '80s, calling them a “sure money loser”—a comment that now reads like one of the worst misjudgments in sports business history.Also Read: “The death of my dream”: Gisele Bündchen’s tearful interview marked a turning point in her healing journey after Tom Brady divorce What if Trump had succeeded?

Candace Parker on WNBA Pay, Flying with Shaq on His Private Plane & Having Her Jersey Retired Twice

The Final Act That Led To Parker's Funny Revalation

Why Candace Will Never Fly With Shaq Again

When it comes to luxury travel, few experiences can rival a trip aboard a $27 million private jet—especially when the host is NBA legend. But for WNBA superstar, her first flight with Shaq was also her last. The reason? A hilarious and unforgettable combination of relentless EDM music and snoring that could drown out even the loudest beats. Candace Parker , a three-time WNBA champion and two-time league MVP, has shared the screen with Shaquille O’Neal on TNT’s popular “Inside the NBA.” Early in her tenure, Candace Parker was invited by Shaq to skip the airport hassle and join him on his private jet after a shoot in North Carolina. The offer sounded like a dream: no security lines, no waiting, and a chance to travel in true superstar style.“I thought, cool, no waiting at the airport,” Parker joked, recalling her initial excitement about the trip.As soon as the jet took off, Parker’s expectations were flipped upside down. Instead of a quiet, relaxing journey, Shaq transformed the aircraft into a full-blown party venue. Acting as the in-flight DJ, Shaquille O’Neal blasted electronic dance music (EDM) at full volume for nearly the entire duration of the flight—over four hours of relentless beats.- Shaq’s DJ skills are well known, and he’s passionate about EDM.- The music was so loud that conversation was nearly impossible.- Parker described the experience as “EDM-fueled chaos”.Just when Candace Parker thought the high-energy soundtrack would finally end, Shaq fell asleep with about 35 minutes left in the flight. But the peace was short-lived—Shaq’s snoring, according to Parker, was even louder than the music that had been blasting for hours.“He DJ’ed on full blast for four hours and 38 minutes, and then proceeded the last 35 minutes to fall asleep and snore louder than the music. So that was the first and the last time that I took Shaq’s plane,” Parker recounted, laughing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live”.The experience was so overwhelming that Parker vowed never to accept another invite to Shaq’s jet, no matter how tempting the offer. She humorously described herself as “scarred” by the ordeal and made it clear that her days of flying with Shaq are over.Despite the chaos, Candace Parker emphasized that her friendship with Shaquille O’Neal remains strong. She admires his larger-than-life personality and his ability to keep things entertaining—both on the ground and in the air.While the story has become a favorite among fans for its comedic value, it also highlights the genuine camaraderie between Parker and O’Neal. Both champions in their own right, they share a mutual respect and affection that goes beyond TV banter and travel mishaps.Candace Parker’s one-and-done trip on Shaquille O’Neal’s $27 million private jet is a story for the ages—a wild ride filled with pounding EDM, thunderous snoring, and plenty of laughs. While she may never board Shaq’s jet again, the tale perfectly captures the unpredictable and entertaining world of sports legends off the court.Also read: Kevin Durant’s Baseball Quip About Michael Jordan Leaves LeBron in Stitches on ‘Mind The Game’ Podcast For Candace Parker, it was an experience she’ll never forget—and one she’s happy to leave as a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.","Candace parker has shared the screen with shaquille o’neal on tnt’s popular “inside the nba.” parker was invited by shaq to skip the airport hassle and join him on his private jet after a shoot in north carolina.

Ilya Sorokin’s agent strongly responds to ongoing trade speculation surrounding the star goaltender

New York Islanders committed to Ilya Sorokin as franchise cornerstone

With the NHL free agency period winding down and news growing scarce, speculation has fueled trade rumors to keep the offseason lively. One of the latest names caught in that swirl is New York Islanders goaltender Ilya Sorokin. However, Sorokin’s agent, Dan Milstein, quickly ended any talk of a potential move, firmly stating that his client is not going anywhere.As rumors picked up suggesting the New York Islanders had considered trading Ilya Sorokin, most notably to the Utah Mammoth for the No. 4 overall draft pick, his agent stepped in to set the record straight. Dan Milstein took to social media platform X to issue a strongly worded denial:“Ilya Sorokin has a full no-trade clause and has never been part of any trade discussions — not at any point. Surprised this needs correcting, but here we are. There’s a difference between reporting facts and creating buzz around yourself.”That statement put an end to speculation that the Islanders were looking to move the 28-year-old star goaltender, who is currently in the second year of an eight-year, $66 million contract signed in July 2023. With a full no-trade clause in place, any deal involving Sorokin would require his explicit approval, something his camp says hasn’t even been discussed.Beyond the contract details, Ilya Sorokin’s performance remains a key reason why the Islanders would be reluctant to move him. Despite a bumpy 2024–25 season for the team, Sorokin still managed a .907 save percentage, a 2.71 goals-against average, and four shutouts across 61 starts. He remains firmly ranked among the NHL’s top goaltenders.Injuries have also made the idea of trading Sorokin illogical. Backup goalie Semyon Varlamov is recovering from lower-body surgery, leaving the Islanders with limited goaltending depth. General manager Mathieu Darche has stressed a focus on stability and development, not roster shake-ups.Ilya Sorokin isn’t going anywhere, and his agent’s comments confirm that the New York Islanders remain committed to their star netminder. As offseason rumors continue to swirl across the NHL, this situation serves as a reminder that not all trade buzz is based in reality, especially when a franchise cornerstone is involved.Also Read: “I can relate”: Jack Eichel reacts to Mitch Marner joining the Vegas Golden Knights","Ilya sorokin’s agent strongly responds to ongoing trade speculation surrounding the star goaltender.
