30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",Indian army intensifies anti-terror ops in j&k to flush out pak terrorists amid chillai kalan.

Shashi Tharoor Responds To Digvijaya Singh, Says Congress Needs Discipline, Not Lessons From RSS

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Sunday stoked controversy as he compared the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) with Islamic terror outfit al-Qaida, saying the BJP’s ideological mentor ""breeds hatred and propagates hatred"".Reacting to Congress leader Digvijay Singh's remark praising the organisational strength of the RSS, Tagore said, ""there is nothing to learn from the RSS,"" which is the ideological fountainhead of Hindutva.""RSS is an organisation that spreads hatred.

Hadi Killing: Dhaka Police Say Main Accused Escaped to India via Meghalaya

NEW DELHI: Security agencies in Meghalaya on Sunday rejected claims by the Bangladesh Police that the killers of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi had entered the state. They termed the allegations as unfounded and misleading.""There is no evidence to suggest that any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya. The BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,"" BSF chief in Meghalaya, Inspector General O P Opadhyay was quoted as saying by PTI.A senior Meghalaya police officer said there was “no input or intelligence to corroborate” claims that the suspects were present in the Garo Hills region, adding that local police units had detected no such movement and that coordination with central agencies was ongoing. Border Security Force (BSF) officials said personnel deployed along the international border remain on high alert to prevent any untoward incident, especially in view of the unrest and volatile situation in the neighbouring country.Also Read: 'Horrific': US slams mob violence on Hindu worker Dipu Chandra Das in Bangladesh; demands action The force added that the border in the sector is under constant surveillance and that any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be swiftly detected and dealt with.The Garo Hills region lies in Meghalaya’s western sector, which shares an international border with Bangladesh and is guarded by the Border Security Force.Earlier in the day, Bangladesh Police claimed that two prime suspects in the murder of Inquilab Moncho leader Osman Hadi had fled the country and entered India through the Meghalaya border.Addressing a media briefing in Dhaka, the Additional Commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into India via the Haluaghat border in Mymensingh with the assistance of local associates.Bangladesh Police said the suspects crossed into India through the Haluaghat border, were received by a local contact, and were later taken by taxi to Tura in Meghalaya, according to a report in the Daily Star.He added that Bangladeshi police had received informal reports indicating that Indian security agencies had detained those who assisted the suspects, and said the Bangladesh government is actively working to secure their return.Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, was shot in the head on December 12 during an election campaign in Dhaka. He was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment but succumbed to his injuries on December 18.Hadi, spokesperson of Inquilab Moncho, was a prominent youth leader during the mass street protests in July–August 2024 that contributed to the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government. He was also a parliamentary candidate for the upcoming elections scheduled on February 12.",Bangladesh police say two prime suspects in the murder of inquilab moncho leader osman hadi fled the country and entered india through the meghalaya border.

How BJP reacted

NEW DELHI: On the day the Congress marked its 140th foundation anniversary, senior leader Digvijay Singh’s remarks praising the RSS's organisational strength drew divided reactions from the party leaders, raising fresh questions about potential internal discord.Some Congress leaders dismissed the idea that the RSS could offer any lessons to their party, while others subtly took veiled jibe at Singh.Digvijay Singh sparked row after he shared a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader LK Advani in Gujarat. Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing this to the ""power of organization.""He tagged several senior Congress figures, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, PM Modi, and the official Congress handles.""I found this picture on the Quora site. It is very impressive. In what way did the grassroots swayamsevak of RSS and the worker of Jan Sangh BJP sit on the floor at the feet of leaders and become the Chief Minister of the state and the Prime Minister of the country? This is the power of the organisation.Jai Siya Ram."" Singh's X post read.Reacting to Singh's remarks, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation ""known for Nathuram Godse"" cannot teach anything to an organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Additionally, Congress MP Manickam Tagore launched a sharp attack on Digvijay Singh by sharing a video of an excellent own goal in a football match, writing, ""Famous Self goal. We have one.""Later, he also added that there is ""nothing to learn from Godse's organisation other than Hate. Congress at 140 is still young, and fights hate.""Sachin Pilot said that the opposition party is united, but everyone has the right to their own opinion.""Congress party is united. The country needs a strong opposition. Our intention is to strengthen the organisation. In our party, we have the right to speak about our thoughts,"" Pilot said.""He said whatever he had to, and after that, he also gave his clarification. All the Congress leaders have only one goal to strengthen Kharge and Rahul ji,"" he added.Meanwhile, Shashi Tharoor, known for ruffling feathers within Congress, distanced himself from Digvijay Singh's remarks, saying, “We have a history of 140 years, and we can learn a lot from it. We can learn from ourselves, too,""""There should be discipline in our organisation. Digvijay Singh can speak for himself,"" he added.He, however, also said that organization must be strengthened within Congress.Calling Digvijay Singh a “friend”, Tharoor, when asked whether he had spoken to Singh since he made his remarks, said: “We are friends, and having a conversation is natural. The organisation must be strengthened, there is no question about it.”Earlier, Digvijay Singh had issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'Sanghatan Srijan' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""This is not the first time when senior leaders in Congress have called for organisational restructuring. In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi , calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""Similar concerns were also raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Earlier in 2020, a group of 23 senior leaders in the party had written a letter to Sonia demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party. While some of these dissidents were expelled, others voluntarily left the party but nothing changed in the way Congress functioned.Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay Singh's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party. BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Gandhi was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Gandhi, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""BJP leader CR Kesavan termed the ""autocratic and undemocratic"" functioning of the Congress leadership.""Will Rahul Gandhi show courage & react to the shocking Truth Bomb dropped by Shri. Digvijay Singh's tweet, which has totally exposed how Congress' first family ruthlessly runs the party in a dictatorial manner, and also how autocratic & undemocratic this Congress leadership is?"" Kesavan's X post read.Digvijaya Singh later clarified that while he appreciates strong organisational structures, he remains firmly opposed to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""I support the organisation. I am against the RSS and Modi ji. You have misunderstood. I have praised 'sangathan'. I was, am, and will remain a staunch opponent of the RSS and Modi. Is it a bad thing to strengthen and praise the organisation?"" he said.","Digvijay singh sparked row after he shared a black-and-white photograph of prime minister narendra modi sitting on the floor near senior bjp leader lk advani.

NEW DELHI: Union culture and tourism minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Sunday urged senior Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to return correspondences and documents of the country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru—the father of her mother-in-law and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi—to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library (PMML).He asserted that the documents “belong to the country” and “not to any individual.”“We have requested the return of around 57 cartons containing roughly 26,000 documents that were taken from the museum. Sonia Gandhi has said she will look into the matter. Naturally, these ministerial documents cannot be the personal property of any individual. We have written two letters to her, and we once again urge that they be returned,” Shekhawat told news agency PTI.He recalled that in April 2008, on Gandhi’s instructions, her representative MV Rajan wrote a letter stating that she wished to take back all the “private family letters” and notes of the Congress stalwart.The minister elaborated, “Over a 20-year period, from 1970 to 1990, all the non-official documents related to Nehru were brought to the museum. This included personal letters he wrote to people, the replies received, and his personal comments and notes.Similar documents of all the prime ministers are preserved in the museum. There are approximately 2.5 crore such documents, of which 4 lakh relate to Pandit Nehru alone. ”While documents of other prime ministers remain the museum’s permanent property, Nehru’s were meant only for “safe custody,” he said, adding that it was therefore decided to return to the family any letters they requested.The Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) was established in April 1966, following Nehru’s death in May 1964. In June 2023, its name was changed to the Prime Ministers’ Museum and Library Society to recognise all of India’s prime ministers.",Culture and tourism minister gajendra singh shekhawat urges sonia gandhi to return correspondences and documents of jawaharlal nehru.

CHENNAI: Lottery operator Santiago Martin’s son, Jose Charles Martin, on Friday said his party, Latchiya Jananayaka Katchi (LJK), had expressed interest in an alliance with Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) ahead of the 2026 Assembly election, marking a shift from his earlier criticism of TVK president Vijay ’s political messaging.“We have expressed our interest. Now the response has to come from their side. We have conveyed our willingness,” Jose told reporters when asked about the possibility of an alliance, citing Vijay’s stated position against corruption.Jose said he had not yet spoken directly to Vijay. “We have sent a request first. If they show interest, we will go and meet him,” he said, adding that any meeting would depend on a response from the actor-politician.Responding to questions on his earlier remarks that Vijay’s Erode speech lacked clarity, Jose said his position was being misread. “The speech he delivered last time was like that. We said that the response it received was of that nature because of how he spoke.”“When we say there is a lack of clarity, what we mean is that the people around him are not at that level,” he said. “That clarity is supposed to be provided by them, because the information they are giving him is incorrect.”He also cited Vijay’s limited physical presence in Puducherry as a factor. “He is not going to be here regularly,” Jose said. “The people who are here are the ones who can sit down, get involved, and assess things on the ground. In such a situation, for a local party like ours, it would be good if we have their support.”Jose did not name Aadhav Arjuna, Vijay’s aide and his son-in-law, whom he had earlier accused of misleading the TVK leadership.","Lottery operator santiago martin’s son, jose charles martin, said his party had expressed interest in an alliance with tamilaga vettri kazhagam (tvk) jose said he had not yet spoken directly to vijay.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126218217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-555101,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

5 Ancient Indian tips to improve intelligence and brain power

NEW DELHI: Swearing has long been viewed as something to be avoided in polite society. Yet across cultures, people instinctively use swear words when they are in pain, under pressure or pushing themselves physically.A study in the journal 'American Psychologist' has found swearing can help people perform better in physically demanding tasks by helping the mind shed hesitation and self-doubt.The research, conducted by psychologists from Keele University in the UK and the University of Alabama in the US, analysed two controlled experiments and pooled data from 300 participants. Volunteers were asked to perform a chair push-up exercise, supporting their body weight on their arms for as long as possible, while repeatedly saying either a self-chosen swear word or a neutral word.Participants held the position longer when they swore. Researchers found this was not due to increased muscle strength or adrenaline, but because swearing eased internal mental restraints that often make people stop early.To understand why this happens, the researchers examined psychological factors such as focus, confidence, distraction and humour. They found that swearing helped participants stay more absorbed, feel less distracted by discomfort and feel more confident about continuing.The study describes this effect as a brief psychological state in which people become less self-conscious and less constrained by internal rules - a phenomenon known as ""state disinhibition"". In simple terms, swearing helped people not hold back.Dr Rajul Aggarwal, unit head and senior consultant in neurology at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, said swearing triggers a complex neurological reaction. ""Profanity activates emotion-related regions of the brain while temporarily reducing inhibitory control from the prefrontal cortex,"" he said.""This release can sharpen focus, increase tolerance to pain and improve task performance, even under pressure."" Dr Pavitra Shankar, associate consultant in psychiatry at Aakash Healthcare, said swearing can serve as a brief emotional release in stressful situations, helping people regain focus and confidence.","People instinctively use swear words when they are in pain, under pressure or pushing themselves physically.

NEW DELHI: According to Sun Tzu's ‘The Art of War’, “all warfare is based on deception.”In the wake of the Pakistan conflict in May when the enemy forces attempted to target Indian military assets like air defence systems, including Russia-imported S400 Triumf missile system, with their missiles and drones, India’s elite R&D wing Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has transferred two key indigenous technologies to the Army that will help its soldiers and their military equipment evade enemy detection.Defence Laboratory, Jodhpur (DLJ), DRDO, handed over Camouflage Pattern Generation Software Sigma 4.0 (CPGSS4.0) and a full-scale Multispectral Signature Tank Mock-up to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Engineering (CME) in Pune in the first week of December.“CPGSS4.0 was launched today (Dec 3) by Lt Gen A K Ramesh, SM, Comdt CME in the presence of V S Shenoi, Director, DLJ and will be available for use by tri-services,” DRDO recently posted on X.“A full scale multispectral signature tank mock-up will be use (sic) for training the service personnel in camouflaging and deception technology,” it stated.CPGS 4.0 is an advanced software developed to create highly effective, multi-spectral camouflage patterns for military equipment, helping soldiers blend into diverse terrains by countering detection across visible light, infrared (IR), and radar sensors, thereby significantly boosting battlefield deception and survival training for the Indian Army.Whereas a multispectral signature tank mock-up is a full-scale, realistic decoy of a battle tank, designed not just to look like a tank in visible light, but to mimic its physical and electromagnetic properties (heat, radar reflection) across various sensor spectrums, allowing soldiers to test and train with advanced camouflage materials to hide tanks from modern threats like thermal, infrared and radar detection.Developing multispectral deception capabilities is the need of the hour as traditional camouflage measures have become less effective in modern warfare.These advanced systems are designed to enhance the Army’s capabilities in camouflage and deception, which are key for survival on modern battlefields where surveillance and sensor technologies are fast advancing.The integration of sophisticated software with a realistic mock-up helps tackle challenges posed by modern detection systems, including thermal imaging, UAV reconnaissance and radar technologies.With the introduction of these technologies, the Army now has the capacity to indulge in concealment methods more effectively, thereby enhancing operational survivability.","Defence laboratory, jodhpur(dlj), drdo handed over camouflage pattern generation software sigma 4.0 (cpgss4.0) and a full-scale multispectral signature tank mock-up.

BSF dismisses Bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into India

DHAKA/SHILLONG: Bangladesh claimed on Sunday that the two prime suspects in the murder of radical Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman Hadi had found sanctuary in neighbouring Meghalaya, inviting instant rebuttals from Indian security agencies about what they said were ""fabricated and malicious"" statements suggesting lapses in BSF's border vigil.""Suspects Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said at a presser. ""According to our information, the suspects entered India via the Haluaghat border.""Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said his department had received “informal reports” about two men identified as “Purti and Sami” being detained in India for assisting the fugitives.BSF inspector general (Meghalaya frontier) Om Prakash Upadhyay said in Shillong that “there is no evidence to suggest any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya” from Mymensingh in Bangladesh. “BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,” PTI quoted Upadhyay as saying. He said the international border was under constant surveillance & any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be promptly detected and dealt with.Meghalaya DGP Idashisha Nongrang, too, issued a statement contradicting the Dhaka police officer’s claim about two alleged collaborators of the fugitives being detained in West Garo Hills. She said reports emerging from Bangladesh about the whereabouts of the killers of 32-year-old Hadi, whose shooting on December 12 plunged the country into another cycle of violent unrest, were “unfounded”.Bangladeshi media quoted Islam as alleging that local contacts helped the fugitives travel by taxi to Tura, the headquarters of West Garo Hills district. He insisted the Bangladesh govt was “actively working” to bring the suspects back. “We are maintaining communication with Indian authorities through both formal and informal channels to ensure their arrest and extradition,” Islam said.The unsubstantiated claims come in the wake of Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt to arrest his killers.The countdown started on December 19, a day after Hadi died in a Singapore hospital of bullet injuries to the head. Hadi was among those who led the July-Aug 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh that led to Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League govt being toppled.He was a candidate for the upcoming February 12 parliamentary elections and was shot while campaigning in Dhaka. Hadi’s brother Omar recently accused some within the interim govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the polls.","Bsf dismisses bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into india.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team..Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars..Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity.The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick mahomes' 15 and the mahomies foundation is making a significant community impact.

I think they both are...They have to make a deal...Too many people died and both Presidents want to make a deal...I've settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one...We are going to have a great meeting today and this gentleman has worked very hard and he and his people are very brave...I am also calling President Putin back after the meeting, and we will continue the negotiations...""

Trump said, ""We're in the final stages of talking. We're going to see. Otherwise, it's going to go on for a long time. It'll either end, or it's going to go on for a long time, and millions of additional people are going to be killed and nobody wants that""

“It’ll either end, or it will go on for a LONG time!”: President Trump

President Donald Trump was flanked by various administration officials and allies as the US and Ukrainian delegations sat down for talks at Mar-a-Lago. In attendance were Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stepiller, hen MWhite House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration, who was present at talks with Russian officials last week.

It lasted for over two hours. We discussed a lot of points. I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close.

US President Trump said that Ukraine and Russia are getting ""closer"" to settling the status of the disputed Donbas territory, but it remains challenging. ""It's unresolved, but it's getting a lot closer. That's a very tough issue, but one that I think will get resolved,"" Trump told reporters in response to a question about the Donbas, in a joint appearance at his Mar-a-Lago estate with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump: If things don't happen, they keep fighting and they keep dying. Zelenskyy does not want that to happen, we don't want that to happen, Putin does not want it to happen.

A Downing Street spokesperson said UK PM Starmer reaffirmed unwavering support for Ukraine and its commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace

Meanwhile, Trump’s call with Putin came as part of what is being viewed as an effort to negotiate a possible peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. However, the Kremlin said the US and Russia agreed that a ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict.”

“I just had a very good and productive telephone call with President Putin of Russia” before the planned talks with Zelenskyy at Trump’s Florida estate at 1:00pm local time (1800 GMT), the US president said on Truth Social.

EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa also reaffirmed that the European Union ’s support for Ukraine “would not falter” ahead of the Florida meeting. They joined a call with Zelenskyy and several European leaders on Saturday.

Zelenskyy also met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Halifax the same day.

Earlier, Zelenskyy said the coming days could be decisive for efforts to end the war, even as Russia intensified missile and drone attacks across Ukraine amid heightened diplomatic activity.

The Florida talks will feature Zelenskyy’s “20-point peace deal proposal,” which he said is “about 90% ready.”

His spokesperson added that Trump and Zelenskyy will call European leaders after their meeting.





United States President Donald Trump met Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago for the peace talks.While posing with Zelenskyy outside the Florida house, Trump again bosted about ending eight wars and said that Russia and Ukraine have to make deal.""Yes, I do (believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about peace this time).

Trump said.Just hours before his meeting with US President Donald Trump at the latter’s Florida club, Zelenskyy briefed UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on their “detailed phone call” and updated him on preparations for the Trump meeting. Earlier, Trump held what he described as a “productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of the Florida talks.Zelenskyy informed Starmer about the frontline situation and the latest Russian strikes.“We discussed preparations for the meeting with President Trump, as well as all our contacts with European partners,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “I informed him on the situation on the frontline and on the consequences of Russian strikes.”While Ukraine is pushing for concrete decisions, Zelenskyy noted that outcomes would depend heavily on international partners supporting Kyiv and maintaining pressure on Moscow.Highlighting the scale of recent Russian strikes, Zelenskyy said: “This week alone, they launched over 2,100 attack drones, around 800 guided aerial bombs, and 94 missiles of various types,” targeting civilians and critical infrastructure, especially energy systems.He said Ukrainian emergency and energy teams were working around the clock to mitigate the impact.“Our repair crews, energy workers, and first responders of Ukraine's State Emergency Service are working literally 24/7 to protect lives and restore power supply,” Zelenskyy said.","Trump ‘dumps’ ukraine ceasefire in hour-long call with putin just before meeting zelenskyy.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan fm ishaq dar admits india hit nur khan air base in operation sindoor strikes.

Why the rumor didn’t add up, and what Jordan Chiles has said about her dating life

Jordan Chiles is an Olympic gymnast and competed for the U.S. at the 2020 and 2024 Olympics. Chiles had to deny a recent rumor that allegedly included an engaged woman on Dancing With the Stars, Ezra Sosa. This rumor was circulating online after the show’s season 34 finale. The news about the possibility that Chiles and Sosa would join them after they had won the third round prompted much speculation on social media. Sosa quickly abandoned the claim, posting a photo of the headline on Instagram, saying, “News to me,” and then tagging Chiles, “Congratulations to us.”Jordan Chiles reshared Ezra Sosa’s post using laughing emojis, hinting that both were in agreement that it was funny and false. Their public response to the question essentially ended this speculation, and neither one stated that the claim had any factual basis.This was a rumor, largely because the pair had chemistry on screen throughout the season. They performed at every turn for judges and viewers, and their close collaboration became one of the most talked-about aspects of the competition. Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa, though, did not suggest they were actually together beyond the dance floor.Ezra Sosa’s engagement claim was likely to fail, despite its immediate negation. Sosa is gay and has also previously talked about how he “came out of the public eye” since joining Dancing With the Stars in 2021. He has also said in previous interviews that while he did not initially discuss his sexuality publicly, it was a journey for him and not an attempt to hide who he was.In addition to the denial, a number of details made the engagement claim unlikely. Ezra Sosa is also a publicly gay man who has previously spoken of coming out as an outspoken critic since joining Dancing With the Stars in 2021. In the past interviews, he has stated that although he did not initially publicly describe his sexuality, it was a journey and not an attempt to hide who he is.Jordan Chiles has also recently been talking about her life. On the Keke Palmer podcast, Baby, This Is Keke Palmer, the gymnast admitted she’s currently single. She said the first relationship she had with another woman was because she had problems communicating due to distance, time zone differences, and inconsistent dates.Jordan Chiles has tended to keep her dating life private, but she has publicly spoken about her tastes. She has said she would not marry another gymnast, but she would be open to someone else dating outside of her sport. Fans briefly linked her to Tariq Woolen, an NFL player, in 2024, although he never officially told anyone about it.Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa’s marriage is one of the highlights of the season, though the official engagement promises were false. After weeks of consistent performances and performance, the duo dropped to third place in the final. In a touching Instagram post before the finale, Chiles declared Sosa his “best partner ever.”The engagement rumor quickly became public, but the two athletes made it out in plain English and with humor, showing that they were related more to professionalism, trust, and teamwork than to romance.Also Read: Unexpected star guest sends fans into frenzy during Jordan Chiles’ DWTS finale rehearsal","Jordan chiles’ engagement rumor involving dwts partner ezra sosa gets shut down with one instagram post.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan.

Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said he will meet us president donald trump in florida over the weekend.

Will diplomats too have to give their biometrics?

Will Canadians have to submit their biometrics?

Are US citizens exempt from the new rule?





From December 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-US citizens, including Green Card holders, at border points comes into effect. This means their photographs would be taken by US Customs and Border Protection officials at every entry and exit point across airports, land crossings and seaports. This new rule is applicable to all non-US citizens entering or exiting the country. Children below 14 years and adults over 79 years are also included.The biometric system aims to address security and visa-overstay concerns. DHS says it is not for broad surveillance, though critics remain wary.This is not entirely new. Biometric collection at exit for the US was limited to pilot programs at select ports. Now this is mandatory.The CBP may also decide to collect fingerprints and iris scans and match them against existing travel documents as part of the Traveler Verification Service.The CBP confirmed that the diplomats are not exempt from the program. They will also have to give their biometrics.Previous regulations allowed diplomats to bypass certain biometric collections; however, the new mandate explicitly removes this exemption, requiring them to provide biometrics upon both entry and exit.Yes, Canadians too are not exempt from the new rule. The new rules are applicable to all non-US travellers even those who are traveling on private aircraft or crossing the border on foot.The rule applies to almost all non-U.S. citizens, including Green Card holders who are the lawful permanent residents and Canadian visitors who were previously exempt from certain requirements.Yes, the biometric collection is not meant for US citizens but the CBP said that US citizens, if they want, can voluntarily participate in the facial biometrics process at entry and exit. U.S. citizens who prefer to opt out of the facial biometrics process may simply notify a CBP officer or airline representative and undergo manual inspection of their passport, as required for international travel.CBP said it discards US citizens' photos within 12 hours of the identity verification process and enrolls noncitizens in the DHS Biometric Identity Management System, which retains the photos for up to 75 years.","From december 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-us citizens, including green card holders, at border points comes into effect. This means their photographs would be taken by us customs and border protection officials at every entry and exit point across airports, land crossings and seaports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126190688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Kenny Stills believes “Trump curse” played a part in Detroit’s late-season setback



What looked like a season heading toward meaningful January football has ended with frustration, questions, and a sense of opportunity wasted. The Detroit Lions’ campaign unraveled at the wrong time, and their 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas night finally closed the door on any postseason possibility while clearing the way for the Green Bay Packers to secure their place instead.The defeat was not an isolated stumble. It capped a worrying run of form in which Detroit simply could not hold its footing during the most demanding stretch of the schedule. Performances dipped, execution failed, and the Lions repeatedly found themselves second best. By the time Minnesota controlled Thursday night’s contest, it felt like the end result had been building for weeks.As the disappointment settled, an unexpected angle resurfaced online. Former Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills revisited an earlier moment from Detroit’s season, sharing a clip of Amon-Ra St. Brown’s celebration from the Lions’ convincing win over Washington. Stills suggested that the celebration invited bad luck, even calling it a “Trump curse” on Twitter, sparking debate rather than being brushed aside as harmless commentary.That celebration once symbolized Detroit’s swagger, coming in a game they controlled comfortably.What followed tells a harsher story: only two wins in seven outings, momentum gone, confidence shaken, and ultimately the playoff push slipping away. Supporters can joke about superstition, but the real issue lies in how quickly standards dropped when pressure intensified.Against Minnesota, the shortcomings were clear. Drives failed to sustain, defensive gaps appeared at crucial moments, and the Vikings showed greater composure in decisive situations. It wasn’t a curse that ended Detroit’s season; it was a mix of stalled offense, lapses in execution, and timing that worked entirely against them.Now the Lions head into the offseason knowing this one will hurt. A promising position dissolved into a late-season slide that cost them everything they were chasing. The challenge ahead is not about addressing online narratives; it is about restoring consistency, rediscovering belief, and ensuring a collapse like this does not define the group moving forward.",Kenny stills believes ‘trump curse’ played a part in detroit’s late-season setback.
