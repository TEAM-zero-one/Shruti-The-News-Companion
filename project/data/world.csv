'Pick up the baton': Mani Shankar Aiyar's pitch for Pinarayi Vijayan sparks row; Congress draws line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pick-up-the-baton-mani-shankar-aiyars-pitch-for-pinarayi-vijayan-sparks-row-congress-draws-line/articleshow/128406148.cms,"‘No connection whatsoever with the Congress’

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Sunday stoked a fresh controversy after lauding Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and expressing hope for the return of the Left government in the upcoming assembly elections.This comes as the Congress seeks a return to power in Kerala in the polls scheduled for May this year.Speaking at an international seminar titled “Vision 2031: Development and Democracy”, Aiyar asked Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped.”He added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is Kerala, ruled by a “Marxist-Leninist party”.“I do not know whether this is a compliment or an insult, but I deeply regret the absence of my party colleagues on this occasion, which is a state occasion and therefore a national occasion. While Kerala is the first state in panchayati raj in practice, it ranks only second in law,” Aiyar said.“So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am confident will continue in office, I renew my plea — to reinforce Kerala as the best panchayati raj state in the country.State laws should be amended based on practical experience, Thomas Isaac’s insights, the five-volume report I chaired, and the note on district planning by V K Ramachandran circulated by the Planning Commission when it truly supported panchayati raj,” he added.“Therefore, I must fall at your feet, Chief Minister Vijayan, and request you to pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped. Thank you, and may Kerala prosper,” he further said.Vijayan described Aiyar’s remarks as “charismatic words” that resonated with the current context.In a social media post about the Vision 2031 International Conference, he said Aiyar’s observations reflected the contemporary scenario and reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening grassroots democracy.“We stand united in the belief that democracy flourishes only when power resides with the people. We will continue to strengthen our local bodies as the heartbeat of growth,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader said.Meanwhile, Aiyar’s remarks did not go down well with the Congress leadership.Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera sought to distance the party from Aiyar’s comments, saying he has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar “speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity”.""Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity,"" Khera said.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh also rubbished Aiyar's remarks and said that the United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to return to power in Kerala.“Let there be no doubt. The people of Kerala will bring the UDF back for more responsible and responsive governance. They also know the LDF and BJP are covert partners,” he said.","Mani shankar aiyar asked kerala chief minister pinarayi vijayan to “pick up the baton that the congress has dropped” he added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is kerala, ruled by a “marxist-leninist party’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128406192,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-772505,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

COIMBATORE: Operation Sindoor reflected a Rudra-like resolve of Lord Shiva, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Sunday, while using the example to emphasise that societies governed by fear cannot remain secure and only a fearless people can build a strong nation.Addressing the 32nd Mahashivratri celebrations at Isha Yoga Centre, Singh framed fearlessness as a spiritual strength rather than a product of brute force. ""Real security,"" he said, ""comes from inner confidence and national consciousness, not only from material capability.""Invoking Lord Shiva as a symbol of protection and destruction, Singh drew a parallel with the armed forces, which he described as blending patience and compassion with decisive strength. He pointed to humanitarian assistance during crises as an expression of protection and to operations such as Sindoor as moments when firmness become essential. Discipline and resolve of soldiers are rooted in India's cultural foundations and inspiration drawn from Lord Shiva, he added.Singh cautioned that modern life's fixation on material gain often erodes inner well-being. Spirituality helps restore balance and unlock human potential, allowing personal growth to translate into service to society and the nation, he said.India's strength, he said, lies in cultural unity and a spiritual ethos that Union govt has sought to project globally. Yoga is a priceless Indian offering now embraced worldwide in renewed form, he added.Culture and science, often treated as separate, have long complemented each other in India, the minister said, calling space missions such as Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya-L1 modern expressions of an ancient scientific spirit.Singh said service to humanity is service to Lord Shiva. He linked that idea to Centre's welfare initiatives of the past decade across education, healthcare and living standards, alongside cultural projects, citing Ujjain Mahakal, Kashi Vishwanath and Somnath corridors and construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.Isha Foundation founder Sadhguru described Mahashivratri as a night to be at one's best, warning that failing to act on one's capacity leads to decline. More than 2 lakh people attended, including political figures. Western Air Command, Army's Southern Command and Western Naval Command were felicitated for the success of Op Sindoor.","“from compassion to combat, operation sindoor reflects new india” rajnath singh said.

'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





Bangladesh will vote Thursday in a Parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for India than any such exercise in the recent past in its neighbourhood. Ironically, with Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League not in the fray, India’s best hopes of a realistic reset in ties with Dhaka rest on a majority for the frontrunner Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Hasina’s bête noire and a party with historically fraught ties with New Delhi.Wrongfooted by the 2024 July Uprising that ousted long-term ally Hasina, India intensified its outreach to the BNP realising the then Khaleda Zia-led party offered the optimum choice for future legitimacy and stability in the country. The renewed engagement with BNP leaders, PM Narendra Modi’s offer of help for Zia’s treatment just before her demise and his letter to her son and current leader Tarique Rahman, delivered through foreign minister S Jaishankar, firmed up the initiative, despite the restraining factor of Hasina’s presence in India.In the absence of the banned Awami League, the election is expected to see a tight bipolar contest between the BNP alliance and the other major bloc comprising 11 parties – including a curious mix of Islamists and Gen-Z revolutionaries - which is led by India’s traditional foe Jamaat-e-Islami.Jamaat is joined by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a new political outfit composed of student leaders who led mass protests that toppled Hasina.Apart from the election outcome, India will also closely follow the Constitutional “July Charter” referendum that will take place alongside the general election. With its emphasis on a two-term limit for the PM, introduction of an upper house to review legislation and on Bangladeshi, not Bengali, identity, the referendum seems designed not just to prevent the return of “authoritarianism” but also to minimise India’s deep-rooted cultural and linguistic bonds with the country.While India would not like to delay any outreach to the likely new government, given the significance it attaches to ties with Dhaka for its own security and also Bangladesh’s growing reputation as a “swing state” coveted by powers like the US and China, any such exercise will be mindful of several key concerns.First of course is security. Not allowing Indian insurgent groups in the northeast to use Bangladesh territory against India will top India’s agenda with the new government, given that the BNP-Jamaat government two decades ago was accused of providing safe havens to such groups. Robust security cooperation, including intelligence-sharing, can mitigate concerns.Equally important will be preventing Pakistani forces from using Bangladesh to target Indian interests. The interim government has already effected a dramatic turnaround in ties with Pakistan and efforts to step up defence and security ties with frequent visits to Dhaka by ISI officials will aggravate India’s security concerns. Pakistan pivot is also what the BNP-Jamaat government was accused of in the past. India will also watch closely Chinese ingress into Bangladesh’s defence sector, including a recent deal to manufacture drones not far from Indian territory.The safety and security of the 13-million strong Hindu community will also be on top of India’s agenda with the new government, as evident from the way Modi has himself raised this issue on several occasions. India will expect continued cooperation for transport of goods to the northeast through ports in Bangladesh under the existing frameworks.However, for any outreach to be meaningful, India might have to first address the Hasina factor. The BNP will press on with the demand to extradite Hasina, who has been sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity. According to a source in Dhaka, this is an issue that relates to the people’s sentiments and India will not be seen as a reliable ally till the time it is seen as shielding Hasina.While a likely BNP government is expected to aggressively pursue issues related to border killings, water sharing and even revival of SAARC, India might also face a challenge in the form of a resurgent Jamaat that is projected to win anywhere between 50 to 100 seats, more than ever in its history. If that happens, the party could trigger some serious anxiety in India about its role not just as a powerful opposition but also a potential ally of the BNP.","Bangladesh will vote thursday in a parliamentary election that will perhaps have more far-reaching consequences for india than any such exercise in the recent past.

Stock market today: After deep cuts towards the end of last week, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , opened in red on Monday. While Nifty50 was below 25,450, BSE Sensex dropped over 100 points in opening trade. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,434.35, down 37 points or 0.14%. BSE Sensex was at 82,520.90, down 106 points or 0.13%.Last week, Nifty and Sensex closed in red, with benchmark indices slipping about 1% as concerns over artificial intelligence-led disruption and heavy selling in technology stocks weighed on investor sentiment. Analysts said that with technology shares undergoing repricing and uncertainty surrounding AI-driven disruption persisting, investors should adopt a selective and risk-managed investment approach.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The IT sell-off last week will continue to weigh on markets in the near-term. The mild recovery in IT ADRs on Friday is unlikely to support IT stocks. Institutions are likely to continue selling IT stocks and switch to sectors like financials, automobiles, capital goods, telecom and pharma where there is good earnings growth visibility.Brent crude is delicately balanced at around $68 on the concerns surrounding the geopolitical tensions between US and Iran. This has to be closely watched.Investors can use the current volatility in the market to churn portfolios in favour of growth sectors like those mentioned earlier. Overall, the market prospects for 2026 appear good since fundamentals are improving and valuations have turned reasonable in tune with long-term averages. Mid and small caps, though relatively overvalued, are reporting better-than-expected earnings.""In the United States, the S&P 500 ended marginally higher on Friday after inflation data indicated easing price pressures. However, the Nasdaq finished lower as major technology and communication services stocks declined amid continuing concerns about the potential impact of artificial intelligence on existing business models.Asian markets traded in a narrow range, alternating between modest gains and losses. Softer US inflation data strengthened expectations that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates later this year, helping stabilize sentiment after recent volatility linked to AI-related disruption fears.Foreign portfolio investors remained net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs 7,395 crore on Friday. Domestic institutional investors, in contrast, were net buyers, purchasing shares worth Rs 5,554 crore, according to exchange data.","After deep cuts towards the end of last week, nifty50 and bse sensex opened in red on monday.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the international fleet review (ifr) and exercise milan from feb 15 to 25.

Combat Proven SCALP Missiles Push India, France Defence Ties Into Next Phase After Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: US commander of Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel J. Paparo, during his India visit on Sunday, “applauded the tactical execution” of the Indian military operations against Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and said “there is always a lesson to learn from every conflict in the world”.He said the US-India defence relationship is on a “steeply upward trajectory”, even as he flagged concerns about increasing “coercion” and “aggression” in the Indo-Pacific region.In reply to a TOI query about his views on Op Sindoor, the US commander, who was interacting with a select group of journalists, said, “First of all, I have tremendous reverence for the terrible event (Pahalgam terror attack) that preceded the crisis. In my discussion with my partners, I applaud the tactical execution (of operations). We also sincerely applaud the restraint that was exhibited. We hope to work together to see that such a terrible event doesn't happen again. ” The Admiral also said that he has seen a deep commitment from the Indian military to learn lessons from this conflict.Asked what lessons the US took away from Op Sindoor which saw Chinese weapons being used by Pakistan, Admiral Paparo said, “Complex long-range weapons have complex long- range kill chains”.With the “combination of sensors, communication, propulsion, warheads, seekers in the 21st century, geography is no longer a commodity...”On China’s increasing military might, the Admiral, who is responsible for all US military operations in the region, said, “Deterrence is our highest duty. It is my job to think through the worst-case scenario and to be prepared for that. India shares some of those concerns in the Indo-Pacific, as the region is home to 60% of the world’s population, more than 60% of the world’s GDP and seven of the world’s largest militaries.“We deal with those concerns with the growing partnerships... mutually respectful, sovereign relationship between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy,” he said, adding both the US and India are committed to the principles of sovereignty, freedom of navigation and freedom of seas.“We applaud India as a great net contributor to the security of the Indian Ocean region,” he said. The two sides are also looking at boosting maritime security cooperation, including in the sphere of undersea domain awareness.With the impending MILAN exercise in mind, Admiral Paparo said, “It is great to see the deepening of Indo-US defence partnership, enshrined in the recent defence agreement signed in Kuala Lumpur (Oct 31, 2025) between US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh. A number of joint exercises like Yudh Abhyas in Alaska, MILAN, Malabar series, COPE India exercise and Tiger Triumph series and people-to-people contacts are strengthening the ties between India and the US. And we treasure this relationship.”About modern warfare strategies, the Admiral said, “Increasingly, the 21st century will be dominated by actors who master the information environment, that is, space, counter-space, electronic warfare, low observability and other technologies.”On the upcoming AI summit hosted by India, he said, “PM Modi’s visionary AI summit. I celebrate India’s vision on how to make use of AI in the 21st century.

They want to raise their issues, especially ahead of the assembly polls,"" he said.During the first part of the session, the Lok Sabha experienced disruptions from February 2 onward, following Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's disallowance by the chair from quoting excerpts from former army chief M M Naravane's unpublished memoir, which referenced the India-China conflict in 2020.On February 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unable to respond to the debate on the Motion of Thanks due to protests by the opposition.In an unprecedented move, the Motion of Thanks was passed on February 5 without the customary speech from the prime minister. The Speaker read the Motion of Thanks to the president for her address, and it was passed by voice vote amid sloganeering from opposition members.Birla later stated that he received concrete information suggesting that several Congress MPs might carry out an ""unexpected act"" near the prime minister's seat, prompting him to advise Modi against attending the House for his address. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra refuted this claim.Subsequently, eight opposition members were suspended for the remainder of the Budget Session for unruly behaviour in the House.Last week, the speaker decided to step aside from his role as the presiding officer of the House, hours after the opposition submitted a motion for his removal from office, alleging that he had acted in a ""blatantly partisan"" manner.","Kiren rijiju says debate on no-confidence motion against lok sabha speaker om birla will be taken up on march 9.

Pakistan Admits US-Backed Jihad In Afghan Wars A Mistake, But Still Accuses India Of Proxy War

NEW DELHI: India must continue to expose Pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups and its tendency to pursue a proxy war against neighbouring countries as Islamabad has long evaded accountability due to the apathy of the international community, a latest report in a US-based independent journal has said.“Simultaneously, India needs to enhance its anti-terrorism apparatus to effectively tackle the scourge of Pakistan sponsored terrorism single-handedly and in addition to military retribution, also consider non-kinetic measures that impose a prohibitive cost on Islamabad,” said the report in Eurasia Review.Writing for Eurasia Review, former army officer Nilesh Kunwar said, “While its designation may sound impressive, the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee is unfortunately just a ‘paper tiger’ that bases its reports on feedback from member states without investigating the same or giving any directions. Its recently released 37th report has linked Pakistan based proscribed terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad to the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack, the Nov 9, 2025, Red Fort suicide car bombing, as well as its formal announcement of a women-only wing named Jamaat-ul-Muminat created for waging global jihad. However, by qualifying that these incidents or developments were what a member state (implying India) had noted, the UN report has characteristically not endorsed its own observations on the same.”It further said, “While there’s no doubt that the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team lacks ‘teeth’ and doesn’t act as an effective deterrent, yet, this report does provide diplomatic leverage. In the instant case, India definitely has an advantage since unlike Islamabad’s palpably false claim of JeM being “defunct,” which is a feeble defence -- New Delhi’s assertions on JeM’s activities are corroborated by irrefutable hard evidence,” it said.The attempt of DG ISPR (media wing of Pakistan armed forces) to deny JeM chief’s presence in the country was laughable because just a few days earlier, Pakistan’s then foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not only confirmed Masood Azhar’s presence in Pakistan but even given his health update by saying, “He is very unwell… to the extent that he cannot leave his house,” the report said.There is definitely a need for India to be more proactive and expose Pakistan’s ongoing use of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy more forcefully by following the ‘name and shame’ policy, it said.","India must continue to expose pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups, report says.

Faith Versus Access Debate Erupts As Char Dham Temples Kedarnath, Badrinath Weigh Ban On Non Hindus

The big picture: Growth almost identical to the world

A religion defined by geography

Growth driven by births, not conversions

Living mostly as a majority

Age structure and fertility patterns

The global future of Hinduism

There was once a phrase that economists used, sometimes flippantly and often unfairly, to describe India’s slow economic expansion in the decades after Independence. They called it the “Hindu rate of growth” — a shorthand for stagnation, caution and incremental change. The term has long since fallen out of favour in economic discourse. But in an unexpected way, it could be used to describe the actual Hindu growth of rate.According to the Pew Research Center’s global demographic study “How the Global Religious Landscape Changed From 2010 to 2020,” the actual Hindu rate of growth today turns out to be strikingly literal. The world’s Hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself. Neither surging dramatically nor shrinking in relative terms, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of stability in a century defined by rapid religious change.New global religion data suggests that when it comes to population trends, Hindus today embody something remarkably close to that old metaphor. The global Hindu population is growing, steadily and predictably, almost exactly in step with the world itself.Neither surging dramatically like some faiths nor shrinking in relative terms like others, Hinduism’s demographic story is one of continuity rather than upheaval.Between 2010 and 2020, the global Hindu population rose from roughly 1.07 billion to about 1.2 billion — an increase of around 126 million people in just one decade. Yet their share of the world’s population remained nearly unchanged at about 15%.This reflects an almost perfect demographic alignment. During the same period, the world population itself grew by roughly 12%, and the Hindu population expanded at nearly the same pace.By contrast, other major religions experienced sharper shifts. Muslims increased their share of the global population, while Christians saw their proportion decline. Hindus stood out as the only major group whose global footprint remained essentially stable.One of the most striking numbers in global religious demographics is the degree of Hindu concentration. About 99% of Hindus live in the Asia-Pacific region. Even more remarkably, roughly 95% reside in just one country: India. Nepal accounts for most of the remaining share. This makes Hinduism the most geographically concentrated major religion in the world. India alone determines the demographic trajectory of nearly a billion people.Unlike Christianity or Islam, which are spread across continents and cultures, Hinduism remains overwhelmingly anchored to a single civilisational geography.Another key finding is that Hindu population change is driven overwhelmingly by natural increase rather than religious switching.Globally, conversion into or out of Hinduism occurs at relatively low levels compared with other religions. This means births minus deaths — not changes in religious identity — shape the long-term trajectory.In demographic terms, Hinduism is one of the least mobile religious identities. Most followers continue to identify with the religion in which they were raised.Few religions are as closely associated with majority status as Hinduism. About 97% of Hindus worldwide live in countries where they form the dominant religious group, primarily India and Nepal. This is the highest majority concentration among all major faiths. By comparison, Christians and Muslims are far more geographically dispersed, with large shares living as minorities in multiple regions.The age profile of Hindus closely mirrors India’s demographic structure. India’s median age is around 28 years, significantly younger than Europe’s median age of over 40. Because India is home to about 95% of Hindus, the global Hindu population also has a relatively youthful base.This youthful demographic momentum helps sustain population growth even as fertility rates decline. India’s total fertility rate has fallen dramatically over the past half century, yet its large young population continues to drive expansion.Looking ahead, the future of Hinduism will remain tightly linked to India’s demographic transition. As fertility rates continue to fall and the population gradually ages, growth will slow in relative terms, even though total numbers will continue to rise for decades. In that sense, the modern “Hindu rate of growth” no longer implies stagnation. It reflects something far more distinctive: a billion-strong religion growing steadily, predictably, and almost perfectly in step with the world itself. In an era of dramatic religious shifts, that kind of numerical stability is a story in its own right.","The world’s hindu population has been expanding almost exactly in line with the growth of humanity itself. Between 2010 and 2020, the global hindu population rose from roughly 1.07 billion to about 1.2 billion. Hindus stood out as the only major group whose global footprint remained essentially stable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128378335,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-440842,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

“From Compassion To Combat, Operation Sindoor Reflects New India” Rajnath Singh

Trade deals part of global integration: PM

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday cited the global context to argue in favour of modernising India’s defence sector, while calling upon the private sector to step up its act and share the gains with workers and shareholders.“Since Day 1, our govt has been clear we will do whatever it takes to support our defence forces and strengthen them. Yes, this year’s allocation is a record high, but viewing it in isolation only provides a limited perspective...As technology reshapes the world, our armed forces must be equipped with the best of Indian innovation and industry. As a nation that is playing an increasingly important role in the world, we have a duty to modernise our defence sector in line with current realities,” PM Modi told PTI in an interview.The comments come in the backdrop of an increasingly-fragile world, which is undergoing a shift in the power equations with the US and China seeking to stamp their expansionist policies, while conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have been going on with no immediate resolution in sight. India has to contend with hostilities in the neighbourhood with cyber technology adding to challenges.The PM referred to Operation Sindoor, which showed India’s familiarisation with the tech warfare.The entire nation is proud of the courage shown by our armed forces during Operation Sindoor. During the operation, one could see the benefits of the reforms we have undertaken in the last decade. Therefore, defence budgets, modernisation, etc, all these are parts of our continuous effort and need not be linked to any particular issue. Yes, the reality is that our nation has to be strong and be prepared at all times, and that is what we are doing,” PM Modi said.Asked about the recent trade agreements, the PM said that they have been part of India’s global integration with the world, which has picked pace in recent times. Asserting that the recent deals — from the UK to the EU — have been in the pipeline for years and will help Indian producers diversify their markets besides opening opportunities for service professionals.“These trade agreements are significant not merely because of tariff reductions but because of supply-chain integration and market access in advanced economies. They gradually liberalise manufacturing tariffs, deepen services integration and create new avenues for labour-intensive exports such as textiles, footwear, electronics and engineering goods. In that sense, they support structural transformation rather than simply boosting headline trade numbers. These FTAs also anchor domestic reform to external commitments. They widen export opportunities, reduce tariff disadvantages relative to competitors, and integrate Indian firms more deeply into global value chains,” the PM said. PM Modi also called on the private sector for a “decisive response” to the govt’s reforms, for which he redoubled his vow.“Indian firms must invest more aggressively in research and development, adopt frontier technologies, deepen supply-chain capabilities and compete on quality and productivity rather than on protected margins. Incentives and tariff preferences can catalyse growth, but durable competitiveness must rest on innovation, efficiency and scale. Equally, as productivity rises, the gains must be shared fairly between workers, shareholders and owner-managers. Sustainable growth requires social legitimacy. Rising real wages, skill upgrading, and stable employment reinforce domestic demand and social cohesion, which, in turn, support long-term investment,” he said.Asked about the Budget’s emphasis on women, PM said welfare of women guided every govt decision. “...it is a matter of national pride that our finance minister, Nirmala Ji has presented the Budget nine consecutive times, which is a record and a matter of pride in itself. Several women across India feel inspired by this,” he said.While listing out several initiatives in the Budget, the PM made special reference to the announcement related to hostels. “Many girls drop out not because of a lack of talent, but because commuting long distances to labs and late study hours are difficult. This intervention directly addresses that constraint.”Further, PM Modi said the steps related to training of Allied Health Professionals, which will benefit women. “Women have always been at the centre of caregiving, but this is largely in the informal sector. By training 1.5 lakh caregivers next year and expanding institutions for Allied Health Professionals, with a target of 1 lakh trained over 5 years, we are embarking on a large-scale effort to formalise care work. This does two things: it creates dignified, certified employment for women and simultaneously strengthens India’s healthcare capacity.”","Pm modi cites global context to argue in favour of modernising india’s defence sector. Comments come in the backdrop of an increasingly-fragile world. Pm modi also called on the private sector for a ‘decisive response’ to the govt”s reforms. “women have always been at the centre of caregiving, but this is largely in the informal sector.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128400493,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-43296,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

'New World Order Emerging, India Ready To Lead As Global Growth Engine', Says PM Modi At ET Summit

Congress calls PM Modi's interview 'scripted'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday outlined India’s reform priorities for the next decade, asserting that his government’s “Reform Express” has delivered systemic transformation and benefitted common citizens in a significant way.In an interview to PTI, PM Modi said that his top three reform priorities for the coming decade will be continued structural reforms, deeper innovation and further simplification of governance, as India moves towards the goal of a “Viksit Bharat”.Asserting that his government’s reform push has moved beyond incremental changes, PM Modi said, “Reform is the commitment of this government, something we have shown in letter and spirit. I am proud to say that we have moved from incremental adjustments to systemic transformation.”When asked to prioritise three economic reforms for the next decade, he said, “Our direction is clear, rather than limiting it to a fixed number.“First, we will continue structural reforms that improve competitiveness and productivity. Second, we will deepen innovation in technology, manufacturing and services. Third, we will simplify governance further so that citizens and businesses can operate with greater ease and trust,” he said.He said that India’s growth story is being shaped by fundamental changes in governance and economic policy. Highlighting the country’s digital transformation, PM Modi said, “India is a digital leader in the world made possible by fundamental reforms in how people transact via the UPI platform.”The prime minister also emphasised the role of data infrastructure in the coming years. “Data centres will be a massive job creator for our youth; we invite whole world’s data to reside in India,” he said.On infrastructure, PM Modi said that India is witnessing an unprecedented expansion. “India witnessing most expansive infra push in its history, built with future readiness in mind,” he told PTI, underlining that infrastructure development is being planned with long-term needs in focus.PM Modi also described productive capital expenditure as a hallmark of his government and said the latest Union Budget avoided short-term populism. Instead, it prioritised record capital outlays to create jobs and strengthen long-term growth.Also Read | 'Focus less on margins': PM Modi says private sector 'critical' for Viksit Bharat, offers strong advise - top quotes He said that India’s goods exports have repeatedly broken earlier records in recent years, reflecting improved competitiveness and global integration.“Our national character has revealed itself even in challenging times; we are bright growth spot in difficult global circumstances,” he said, pointing to India’s resilience amid global economic uncertainty.On trade policy, the prime minister said that India’s free trade agreements are aimed at expanding opportunities for small businesses.“Our FTAs designed to expand market access for MSMEs in textile, leather, chemicals, handicrafts, gems and other sectors,” he said.Looking ahead, PM Modi stressed that the next leap towards a developed India will depend heavily on private sector participation. “Next leap to Viksit Bharat will depend on bold investment by pvt sector in innovation, long-term capacity, global competitiveness,” he said.He also underlined the role of women in India’s development journey. “It is my conviction that women will play the most important role in creating Viksit Bharat,” he said.Framing the broader vision, PM Modi said that the current policy direction should be seen as laying the foundation for long-term national goals. The reforms and investments being undertaken now, he suggested, are meant to prepare India for sustained growth over the next quarter-century.The Congress party reacted sharply to PM Modi's interview calling it “carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise”. Party leader Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the Union Budget and the Opposition’s attack on the government in Parliament.“The PM knows that this year’s Budget has been a damp squib and shows every sign of intellectual exhaustion. Markets have reacted negatively and investors have been unimpressed. Hence, he feels the need to give an interview a fortnight after the Budget was presented and a few days after it was taken apart by the Opposition in Parliament. As usual, there are Modi-style one-liners that mean little in reality,” Ramesh said in a post on X.Ramesh alleged that the prime minister was facing pressure over the trade deal with the United States and farmers’ issues and was attempting to shift the narrative through media outreach.“Under siege and attack because of his surrender to the US on the trade deal, the Prime Minister is now resorting to his favourite tactic of headline management. He is trying to divert attention away from his betrayal of lakhs and lakhs of farmers and other capitulations. His so-called interview is no interview, but a carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise,” he further wrote.","Prime minister narendra modi outlined india’s reform priorities for the next decade.

“Deal Favours US farmers” Opposition Attacks India-US Trade Framework

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday reacted sharply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s interview with news agency PTI, calling it a “carefully scripted and desperate PR exercise” and alleging that it was aimed at diverting attention from key issues.Party leader Jairam Ramesh said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the Union Budget and the Opposition’s attack on the government in Parliament.“The PM knows that this year’s Budget has been a damp squib and shows every sign of intellectual exhaustion.

He maintained that none of his government’s budgets were prepared with the attitude of creating a routine “bahi khata” document.Highlighting digital growth and infrastructure expansion, PM Modi said India is a global digital leader due to reforms in transactions through the UPI platform and added that data centres would be a massive job creator.He also said India is witnessing the most expansive infrastructure push in its history and emphasised that the government will do whatever it takes to support and modernise the defence forces.The prime minister criticised the previous UPA government’s record, saying that during its rule, talks would begin and then break down, with little real substance achieved despite long negotiations.He also said political stability and predictability have restored investor confidence in India and asserted that the welfare of women guides every decision taken by his government.",Party leader jairam ramesh said that the interview was timed to divert attention from criticism over the union budget and the opposition’s attack on the government.

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri will accompany him, according to official sources.BNP had invited PM Narendra Modi for the oath ceremony, along with the leaders of a dozen other countries, including Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif. However, there was never any question of the PM travelling as the date and even the time of the swearing-in was clashing with his bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai that was scheduled weeks in advance.The foreign ministry said Birla’s participation at this “important event” underscored the deep and enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Bangladesh, reaffirming India’s steadfast commitment to the democratic values that bind the two nations.“As neighbours united by a shared history, culture, and mutual respect, India welcomes Bangladesh’s transition to an elected govt under the leadership of Tarique Rahman, whose vision and values have received an overwhelming mandate of the people,” MEA said in a statement.Modi was among the first global leaders to congratulate Rahman on X on Friday morning, shortly after it became evident the BNP leader was going to form the new govt with absolute majority. Modi said the results reflected the trust that the Bangladesh people had in Rahman’s leadership. Later in the day, he also became the first foreign leader to speak to Rahman and offer cooperation with him in his efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.Importantly for India, BNP responded positively to Modi’s messages as it said Bangladesh remained committed to upholding democratic values, inclusivity, and progressive development for all its citizens.“We look forward to engaging constructively with India to advance our multifaceted relationship, guided by mutual respect, sensitivity to each other’s concerns, and a shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in our region,” said the party.","Lok sabha speaker om birla will represent india at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected govt of bangladesh led by tarique rahman.

Kiren Rijiju Explains Why Modi Govt Paused Privilege Notice Against Rahul Gandhi After Dubey's Move

NEW DELHI: Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that the debate and voting on the no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker will be taken up on March 9.""On March 9 in the Lok Sabha, we will have the debate on the no-confidence motion moved against the speaker,"" Rijiju told news agency PTI.""It is the rule to take it up on the first day. There will be a vote following the debate,"" he added.Additionally, a speedy review will be conducted as per the rules, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after Congress MPs submitted a no-confidence motion against the Om Birla , signed by 118 MPs. The Opposition MPs alleged ""blatantly partisan"" conduct and that leaders of opposition parties were not allowed to speak.However, this is not the first time when a no-confidence against Chair has been moved by the opposition. Earlier in 2024, the opposition moved a similar motion against then Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar.History also records at least three instances since Independence when a no-confidence motion was moved to remove the Speaker. The first was against the first Lok Sabha Speaker, GV Mavalankar, in 1954, after MP Vigneshwar Misra alleged that the Speaker was not impartial.In 1966, opposition MPs moved a motion against Speaker Sardar Hukum Singh, with Madhu Limaye leading the charge and Deputy Speaker S V Krishnamoorthy Rao in the Chair.The third motion was moved on April 15, 1987, for the removal of Speaker Balram Jakhar by CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee, with Deputy Speaker Thambi Durai presiding. This motion was axed by the House.What was Nehru's message to Congress MPs when oppn move a no-confidence motion against Speaker GV MavalankarThe first such situation surfaced on December 18, 1954, when the Opposition moved a resolution for the removal of then Speaker Mavalankar. It was admitted after over 50 members stood up in support, and a debate took place over it.India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's message to Congress MPs during the debate in 1954 on the Opposition's resolution to remove then Speaker GV Mavalankar was that they are not bound by any whip or direction, and that all legislators must consider the matter ""regardless of party affiliations"".He had urged Lok Sabha MPs to look at the issue not through the lens of the party but as a matter concerning the dignity of the House.It was a fiery debate during which the Opposition, though weak in numbers, tore into Nehru and accused the speaker of being partisan.Intervening in the debate, Nehru said, ""I would like to address the House, if I may, in my capacity and the high privilege of being the Leader of this House and not as a leader of the majority party. So far as this majority party is concerned, I would like to tell them that not one of them is bound by any whip or any direction: let them vote as they like. It is not a party matter. It is a matter for this House, for each individual, to consider, regardless of party affiliations. """"Therefore, let us try to think of it not as a party issue but as members of this House, because this matter affects the hon. speaker, of course, but it affects the high dignity of this House as Parliament, it affects the first citizen of this country, that is, the speaker of this House,"" he added.What is said about the speaker, what is done about the speaker comes back on each one of us who claim to be members of this House, the then PM said.""I wish members to realise this because I have felt sad and very sad ever since this matter came up before the House. We have known the speaker for many years and we have seen him function and it is possible that some of us may not have exactly the same opinion about him as others have; it is possible,"" he said.""It has so happened that some of us have not particularly liked a decision of his or a ruling of his. It is one thing not to like a ruling or to disagree with it or even to feel, if I may say so, slightly irritated about something that has happened. These things happen. But, it is completely a different thing to challenge the bona fides of the very person in whose keeping is the honour of this House,"" Nehru had said.""I do not say that it is not possible at all to raise a motion against the Speaker. Of course, the Constitution has provided it. Nobody challenges the right of the Opposition or any Member of the House to put forward this motion. I do not deny that right since it has been given by the Constitution.
