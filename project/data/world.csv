TOI Correspondent Washington

: Former diplomats and analysts are cautioning against reading too much into US President Donald Trump's comments dialling down his diatribe against India, saying it is typical of his playbook that includes bait and switch to keep perceived adversaries off-balance. At various times, the MAGA supremo has made similar complimentary remarks about the leaders of China, Russia, and even North Korea, while trying to get a leg up on the countries amid growing mistrust of Trumpian America across the world.""India has little to no reason to trust the US after the administration made an elective choice to tank the relationship by undoing even the achievements with New Delhi from President Trump's own first term,"" former state department official Evan Feigenbaum wrote in a post on social media platform X. The wielding of a sanctions-like instrument against India and repeatedly referring to tariffs as sanctions, he said, ""has stirred up every conceivable bad historical memory and neuralgia about Washington in India from the past"".Forget about salvaging the damaged relationship with India, the Trump regime has by most accounts antagonised even close allies and treaty partners across the world with its MAGA mania. Aside from wrecking ties with neighbours Canada and Mexico, and with nations as far apart as Denmark, Japan and Brazil, the Trump dispensation on Friday managed to antagonise both North Korea and South Korea with different capers.",Former diplomats and analysts are cautioning against reading too much into us president donald trump's comments dialling down his diatribe against india.

US tariffs: Trump signs order granting exemptions; zero duties begin Monday for aligned partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-trump-signs-order-granting-exemptions-zero-duties-begin-monday-for-aligned-partners/articleshow/123736960.cms,"PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong





US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to Reuters.Since taking office, Trump has spent his first seven months raising tariffs sharply as part of his effort to reshape the global trading system, cut US trade deficits and push partner nations into making concessions.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","Us president donald trump signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.

US Official Claims India Will Backtrack On Tariff, Russian Oil, BRICS And Say Sorry To Donald Trump

""NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Saturday alleged that India did not purchase Russian oil before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while reiterating his claim that New Delhi buys it solely to profiteer.In a post on X, Navarro wrote, “Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russia oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukranians. Stop taking American jobs.”The remarks follow a post on Friday in which Navarro said: “India highest tariffs costs U.S. jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. U.S. taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins. Leftist American fake news.”Also read: Trump aide Navarro takes fresh swipe at India over Russian oil; blames tariffs for US job losses Navarro was angered by a Community Note on X that appeared below his post, which said, “India's Russian oil purchases are for energy security, not just profit, & don't violate sanctions.

S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

Poll Should India continue to pursue its relationship with the US despite recent trade tensions? Yes, it's important for strategic interests No, we should focus on other alliances

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-us summit, but modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the sco summit.

India-UK Deal On Economic Offenders: PM Modi Pushes Starmer to Extradite Mallya, Nirav, Lalit Modi

NEW DELHI: A delegation from Britain’s crown prosecution service (CPS) recently inspected Tihar Jail in New Delhi, as part of India’s efforts to convince UK courts to clear the extradition of fugitives wanted on financial and criminal charges, reported news agency ANI.According to people familiar with the matter, the CPS team visited the high-security ward of Tihar and interacted with inmates. Indian authorities assured the delegation that international fugitives brought back to India would be housed in safe conditions and, if required, a special “enclave” could be built inside the jail to accommodate high-profile prisoners.The inspection comes against the backdrop of repeated objections raised by British courts in the past, which have rejected India’s extradition requests citing concerns about prison conditions. To address these hurdles, India has guaranteed that no accused will be subjected to illegal interrogation while in custody.Currently, 178 extradition requests by India are pending abroad, of which nearly 20 are with the United Kingdom. These include cases of arms dealers and individuals linked to Khalistani groups.Among the most high-profile cases are those of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya , accused of defaulting on over Rs 9,000 crore in bank loans, and diamond merchant Nirav Modi , the prime accused in the Rs 13,800 crore Punjab National Bank fraud.Modi, arrested in London in March 2019, has already had his extradition approved by the UK High Court but continues to remain in custody.In July this year, foreign secretary Vikram Misri reiterated that the Indian government was “making the case” with British authorities to fast-track the return of fugitives.

However, should the PM change his mind, he can still travel to New York as the latest list too is only provisional.For its own sake though, India will hope Trump will stand by his latest remarks, unlike on India-Pakistan truce where he reportedly walked back his ceasefire claims, only to let loose a verbal torrent asserting he indeed ended the armed conflict between the two countries.Amid all the talk about a possible shift in India's foreign policy and global realignment, particularly after the SCO summit, the MEA has stressed India cherishes its strategic partnership with the US and wants to carry it forward on the basis of shared interests and mutual respect. However, the govt remains wary of senior Trump administration officials' unprovoked and incessant tirades against India on not just trade but a range of issues, which has seen India ending up as the favourite whipping boy of Trump's MAGA support base, and will wait to see if Trump's latest remarks will put an end to this. Apart from the strife over trade and ties with Russia, India also has to contend with Trump's courting of China, an immigration overhaul that would hurt Indian IT professionals and his dalliance with Pakistan.In quite literally an overnight shift from one extreme to another, Trump and Modi moved to quell the firestorm that has already singed the relationship as the former, hours after having declared India had been lost to China, said there was nothing to worry about in India-US ties.","Us president donald trump said there was nothing to worry about in india-us ties. External affairs minister s jaishankar amplified the message by saying modi attaches enormous importance to the partnership with the us. The development opens up the possibility of a phone call between the leaders, although diplomatic sources did not confirm if there was any such proposal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123741837,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24924,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

""These groups previously had an extensive fundraising network in Canada but now appear to consist of smaller pockets of individuals with allegiance to the cause,"" it noted.Khalistani violent extremist groups have also been known to use networks to solicit donations from diaspora communities to raise and move funds, including through non-profit organisations,"" the Canadian govt's report noted. The acknowledgment of the use of violent means is in contrast to the description of their activities as ""democratic freedoms"" earlier.The report lists BKI and ISYF, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, in the ""politically motivated violent extremism"" category who have been able to generate funds in Canada.These groups, it said, used diverse funding methods to sustain their operations, including the abuse of the money services businesses and banking sectors; use of cryptocurrencies; state financing; abuse of the charitable and NPO sector; and criminal activity.The report covers all violent groups on how they were able to sustain themselves by finding resources within Canada. Self-financing methods were observed in two prominent terrorist attacks in Canada conducted by lone actors radicalised by ideologically motivated violent extremism.It cited the 2020 incident of a 17-year-old male radicalised by the incel (involuntary celibacy) movement who killed a woman and injured another at a massage parlour in Toronto, using only a sword to conduct the attack. Another case cited was from 2021, in which four members of a Muslim family were killed when an individual drove a pickup truck onto a pedestrian crosswalk in London, Ontario. In 2024, the individual was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and attempted murder amounting to terrorism.The report also mentions Canada's financial sector may be exposed to risks emanating from correspondent banking relationships with institutions known or suspected of servicing Hezbollah or Hamas.Cross-border networks and organised IMVE groups differ from lone actors in their financing, it noted. ""Organised groups often rely on online communities and cross-border networks to raise funds and have been observed to rely on a host of financing methods, including commercial activities, such as merchandise sales; hosting paid events, such as talks and concerts; crowdfunding; charging membership fees; and accepting donations,"" it said. ""Some groups have also been known to engage in drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and theft to fund their operations,"" the report added.","Pro-khalistan terror outfits like babbar khalsa international and international sikh youth federation are receiving financial support within canada.

NEW DELHI: Releasing a book on Operation Sindoor , Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday said the India-Pakistan conflict did not end with the May 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time.”The book, ""Operation Sindoor: The Untold Story of India’s Deep Strikes Inside Pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer KJS Dhillon, a veteran.“You may be thinking that on May 10, the war finished; no, because it continued for a long time, with many decisions still to be taken. Beyond that, of course, it will be difficult for me to share here,” General Dwivedi said at the launch event, according to PTI.""India announced its resolve with a new normal, with outstanding clarity in strategic guidance, with a whole-of-nation approach for execution,"" he asserted in his address.The army chief also noted how, throughout the conflict, the force ""moved something like a rhythmic wave.""""When I say rhythmic wave, in these 88 hours, it was not possible for you to come for the planning, pass the orders... so, everybody was synergised, and everybody knew his orders,"" he explained.Hours after the ceasefire took effect on May 10, Pakistan had sent drones into Indian border states — a move it repeated the next night.On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasised that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused.”It was launched on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians. Under it, the Indian forces struck multiple terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in what the government described as “focused, measured and non-escalatory” action.Pakistan retaliated with offensives, prompting Indian counter-strikes, and the conflict dragged on for nearly four days. On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which India accepted.","Op sindoor continued after may 10 as every decision had long-term implications, says army chief general upendra dwivedi.

US Official Claims India Will Backtrack On Tariff, Russian Oil, BRICS And Say Sorry To Donald Trump





Taking a cue from MAGA Supremo Donald Trump 's stubborn stance on tariffs, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday signaled a hardening of the US position on tariffs, saying he expected India to say ""sorry"" and make a deal with the President after its businesses realize they cannot thrive without the US market.Asked in a tv interview about Trump's social media post that virtually jettisoned India as a US partner following the SCO summit in Tianjin, Lutnick likened India's position to that of Canada, which he said had backed down from its adversarial ""elbows up"" stance to make a deal after realizing its economy was tanking.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said suggesting New Delhi's position was all bravado.Lutnick also warned India to ""Stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS , and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff.""Contending that India and China will not be able to sell goods to each other, he maintained that they will eventually have to come to the US because ""it's our $30 trillion economy that is the consumer of the world... (and) we all know eventually the customer is always right.""Characterizing India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" (in BRICS), Lutnick said ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""","Us commerce secretary howard lutnick signaled a hardening of the us position on tariffs.
