QRSAMs designed to intercept hostile fighters

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over Rs 1 lakh crore, ranging from specialised spy aircraft and advanced minesweepers to quick-reaction air defence missiles and underwater autonomous vessels.The biggest project to get “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”, which is just the first step in the long-winded procurement process, was for the indigenous construction of 12 mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for around Rs 44,000 crore, which will take almost a decade, sources told TOI.These specialised warships, each with a displacement of 900-1,000 tonne, will be capable of detecting, tracking and destroying underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.They are crucial amid the expanding maritime collusiveness between China and Pakistan. At present, the Navy makes do with just “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the major capability gap.The second big project was the Rs 36,000 crore procurement of the new quick reaction surface to air missile (QRSAM) systems developed by DRDO , with three regiments for the Army and three squadrons for the IAF.Overall, the Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such regiments.These highly-mobile QRSAMs, designed to intercept hostile fighters, helicopters and drones at ranges up to 30 km, will add to the country’s existing multi-layered air defence network that played a crucial role under Operation Sindoor in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The third major project was for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) planes, designed to identify and help target high-value enemy targets on the ground with greater precision and accuracy by fighter jets and missiles, for around Rs 10,000 crore.These aircraft will be equipped with a wide array of indigenous sensors and systems developed by DRDO, like synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, for gathering “actionable intelligence” in real-time on enemy infrastructure, build-ups and movements.Another interesting project granted AoN was for semi-submersible autonomous vessels for ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions. They will be acquired under the ‘Make-II’ category project, where prototype development is funded by the industry.Two other naval projects included procurement, through competitive bidding, of super-rapid gun mounts (SRGMs), which are the main 76mm guns fitted on warships, and the DRDO-developed “processor-based moored mines” that detonate upon sensing an enemy warship’s acoustic, magnetic or pressure signature.AoNs were also accorded for procurement of armoured recovery vehicles, electronic warfare systems and the tri-Service integrated common inventory management system for better supply chain management, the MoD said.","The defence ministry on thursday gave preliminary nod to three major acquisition projects and seven smaller ones, collectively worth over rs 1 lakh crore.

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth had assured defence minister Rajnath Singh , during a telephonic conversation Tuesday, that the six heavy-duty choppers will be delivered within this year, as was reported by TOI.The six Apache helicopters for the Army will add to 22 such choppers inducted by IAF under the Rs 13,952 crore deal with the US in Sept 2015.

Donald Trump Predicts Major India-US Trade Deal With Lower Tariffs Before July 9 Deadline Ends

How US Trade Deal With Vietnam Will Hit China

World’s Trading Dilemma & China’s Warning

Challenge for China & Its Worry

US President Donald Trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in Asia and Europe has China increasingly on the guard - and rightly so! These trade deals could potentially separate Chinese companies from global supply networks, despite the recently announced trade truce between the US and China.US officials are actively negotiating with key trading allies in Asia and Europe before July 9, seeking arrangements that could limit Chinese involvement and address what the US considers unfair trade practices by China.The temporary 90-day suspension by Trump on what he termed ""reciprocal"" tariffs affecting many US trading partners concludes on July 9. These countries risk facing substantially higher tariffs if they fail to establish trade agreements with the US.Many countries are taking steps to maintain positive relations with Washington. Since Trump's tariff announcement in April, Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea have implemented regulations to prevent product rerouting through their territories to the US.Also Read | What is Donald Trump’s net worth? Billionaire US President has a big portfolio of cryptocurrencies, stocks & more - top details South Korean authorities have intensified their efforts against transshipments, noting an increase in such activities. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te addressed this concern and subsequently introduced regulations requiring all US-destined exports to include legal certification of their Taiwanese origin.President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a new tariff structure with Vietnam, marking the first such arrangement. According to Trump's social media announcement, Vietnamese exports to the US will face a 20% tariff, while goods identified as being transshipped through the country will incur a 40% charge.This arrangement will affect products containing Chinese components that are either minimally processed in Vietnam or simply routed through the country before reaching the US. This structure reflects similar provisions found in existing US trade agreements with Mexico and Canada.The complete details of the agreement remain undisclosed by the White House, with some aspects possibly still under development. The impact on China's increasing exports to Vietnam is yet to be determined. China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet provided a response to enquiries.India, which is reportedly close to finalising a deal, is discussing ""rules of origin"" requirements. The US is seeking a minimum of 60% local value addition for products to qualify as ""Made in India"" and receive benefits under the agreement. According to Bloomberg News, India is attempting to negotiate this requirement down to approximately 35%.The trade war predicament facing Asia centres on its dual reliance: needing US consumer markets while depending on Chinese manufacturing inputs, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis SA. According to the Bloomberg report, in her recent analysis, she highlighted that Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan face particularly high exposure to this situation.Also Read | From ‘dead’ to ‘hottest in world’: Donald Trump calls ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ the path to US making a ‘fortune’; says America growing out of ‘Biden mess’ For most Asian economies, China represents a more significant trading relationship than the United States. Beijing has issued stern warnings about protecting its interests, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to emphasise this position during his upcoming European diplomatic mission to Brussels, Germany and France.""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinese interests in exchange for so-called tariff reductions,"" said the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday, reiterating previous cautions. ""If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.""According to Bloomberg Economics, Vietnam's trade agreement could trigger retaliatory measures from China.""Beijing has signalled its intention to address arrangements that undermined Chinese interests, and the acceptance of increased tariffs on products 'transshipped' through Vietnam could be considered such a case,"" Bloomberg's Rana Sajedi noted in a research analysis.The United States' potential influence on other nations to strengthen or implement export restrictions on advanced technology poses a significant challenge for Beijing, particularly regarding its acquisition of essential semiconductor manufacturing equipment.In June, Taiwan expanded its restricted entities catalogue to include both Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., requiring Taiwanese companies to obtain governmental clearance before engaging in business transactions with these firms.The situation extends beyond Asian borders. Europe faces its own complexities in this matter. China's electric vehicle exports predominantly flow to the EU, whilst Chinese investments in the EU and UK reached 10 billion euros ($12 billion) in the previous year, as documented by Rhodium Group.Also Read | US plans ‘economic bunker buster’ bill: Will Donald Trump impose 500% tariff on countries importing oil from Russia? How it may impact India However, commercial relations are becoming strained. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has recently criticised Beijing for its approach to rare earths and magnets, whilst highlighting concerns about Chinese industrial surplus.The European Union's potential agreement with the US has raised significant concerns in Beijing, particularly regarding provisions similar to those in the British-American deal, which encompassed supply chain security, export regulations and ownership guidelines for industries including steel, aluminium and pharmaceuticals. Although China was not explicitly mentioned, Beijing issued an unusual public critique of the agreement, viewing it as a direct challenge, according to the Financial Times.""China is clearly worried that the EU will accept the same wording as the UK did on export controls,"" said Joerg Wuttke, a partner at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington and former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. ""They are pushing the EU not to do this, and the US is pushing the EU to do it.""The EU and US aim to establish an agreement before July 9, when American authorities plan to implement a 50 per cent tariff on virtually all European products. The EU considers the US relationship more vital, as European exports to America exceed twice the value of those to China, providing the US with substantial negotiating power.The primary challenge facing Beijing lies in the potential consolidation of these initiatives into a broader transformation - beyond US-led restrictions on Chinese exports to a fundamental restructuring of global commerce centred on 'trusted' supply networks, potentially marginalising China. During his Southeast Asian tour earlier this year, President Xi Jinping called for regional unity as an ""Asian family,"" cautioning against commercial fragmentation.Also Read | Not just Apple iPhones! Android smartphone makers like Samsung, Motorola step up exports from India to US; move due to Trump’s tariff policies China typically counters opposition through selective trade restrictions. Following EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles last year, Beijing initiated anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, dairy and pork products. In 2023, it suspended Japanese seafood imports after perceiving criticism from G7 meetings in Japan. A diplomatic dispute with Australia in 2020 resulted in trade limitations affecting various commodities, including lobsters, wine and barley.""If some agreements explicitly list China as a target and show that some countries are cooperating or collaborating with the US to 'contain China,' then China will definitely respond,"" said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and a former adviser to the Chinese Commerce Ministry.","Us president donald trump’s trade policies, tariff wars, and moves to seal trade deals with major trading partners in asia and europe has china increasingly on the guard.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed the Parliament of Ghana during his state visit, drawing applause and smiles when he said that India has over 2,500 political parties.The comment came as part of a broader speech on India’s democratic values and cultural diversity.“India is the mother of democracy. For us, democracy is not merely a system; it is a part of our fundamental values from thousands of years ago,” Modi said. Referring to ancient traditions, he added, “The Rig Veda says: Ano bhadraha kratavo yantu Vishwatah – let good thoughts come to us from all directions. This openness to ideas is the core of democracy.”PM Modi highlighted India’s diversity and said, “India has over 2,500 political parties. I repeat, 2,500 political parties. 20 different parties govern different states. We have 22 official languages and thousands of dialects. This is also the reason that people who came to India have always been welcomed with open hearts.”The moment captured on video showed Ghanaian MPs reacting with smile, surprise and applause at the sheer scale of India’s political plurality.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi visited the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park in Accra and paid floral tribute to Ghana’s founding President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah. Accompanied by Vice President Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, he observed a moment of silence at the mausoleum dedicated to Nkrumah and his wife Fathia.“Dr Nkrumah was a towering figure of Africa’s liberation and unity. This tribute reflects India’s deep respect for Ghana’s history and shared commitment to freedom and justice,” Modi said.During the visit, PM Modi was conferred with The Officer of the Order of the Star of Ghana, the country’s highest civilian award, by President John Mahama. Calling it a “matter of immense pride,” Modi thanked the government and people of Ghana and dedicated the honour to the youth of both nations.“I humbly accept this award on behalf of 1.4 billion Indians. I dedicate this to the aspirations of our youth, our rich cultural diversity, and the historic ties between India and Ghana,” he said.PM Modi’s visit — the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Ghana in over three decades — marks a significant moment in India-Africa relations.

Rijiju to represent India at Dalai Lama b'day event

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday firmly rejected China's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the Dalai Lama's successor and asserted that the issue could be decided only in accordance with the wishes of the Tibetan spiritual leader and established Buddhist traditions.""The Dalai Lama's position is of immense importance, not just for Tibetans but for millions of his followers across the globe. The right to decide on his successor rests solely with him, in accordance with centuries-old Buddhist customs,"" parliamentary affairs and minorities minister Kiren Rijiju told reporters. He also dismissed as ""unwarranted interference"" China's objection to the Dalai Lama's announcement that he has ""exclusive authority"" in deciding who gets to succeed him.The response came after the 90-year-old spiritual head of the Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhists, who has lived in exile in India since 1959, asserted that the institution of Dalai Lama would continue after his death, and that his successor would be chosen by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit set up by him. The Dalai Lama had earlier said his successor would be from among his supporters based outside China: something that runs counter to Beijing's known desire to have one of its loyalists from Tibet anointed.""The Dalai Lama's reincarnation must follow the principles of domestic recognition, the 'Golden Urn' process, and approval by the central govt, in line with religious traditions and laws,"" the Chinese foreign ministry had said in response to the Dalai Lama's statement.With the Dalai Lama turning 90, the succession issue has gained urgency amid fragile India-China ties.The spat over reincarnation adds another layer to bilateral tensions that have persisted since the 2020 border clashes and China's recent diplomatic outreach to Pakistan.Kiren Rijiju, a Buddhist from Arunachal Pradesh, will visit Dharamshala along with his cabinet colleague and animal husbandry minister Lalan Singh, to represent Indian govt at the Dalai Lama's birthday celebrations.The question of succession has long been a sensitive subject for Beijing, which seeks to assert control over Tibetan Buddhism . It holds a grudge against India for its decision to offer shelter to the Dalai Lama when he fled Tibet in 1959. It has dubbed the Tibetan religious leader a ""splittist"". The Dalai Lama, with his saintly image and message of peace and a following that that includes Hollywood celebrities and members of global cultural elite, has been a thorn in China's side, fuelling its desire to reduce the institution of religious leadership of Tibetan Buddhists to an adjunct of the Communist dictatorship.In the 1990s, China controversially installed its own Panchen Lama after the mysterious disappearance of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy selected by the Dalai Lama for the second-most revered figure for Tibetan Buddhists. Panchen Lama has failed to gain acceptance among Tibetans, heightening fears of similar interference in the Dalai Lama's succession.","India rejects china's claim that it has a decisive say in choosing the dalai lama's successor.

NEW DELHI: India has conveyed its concerns to US Senator Lindsey Graham who is sponsoring a sanctions bill that will, if approved, impose 500% tariffs on India, China and others who purchase Russian oil, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said.Graham was quoted as saying earlier this week that President Donald Trump had told him to bring to vote the bill that might help the US force Russia to join peace negotiations on Ukraine. Kremlin, however, has warned that it could adversely impact peace efforts.""Any development in the US Congress is of interest to us if it impacts or could impact our interests.

The embassy and our ambassador have been in contact as well,"" Jaishankar said.While India has traditionally sourced its oil from West Asia, it ramped up purchase from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022.This was mainly because of the discount offered by Russia to offset the impact of western sanctions.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in Mali, a country grappling with a fresh wave of terrorist attacks.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said the Indian workers, employed at the Diamond Cement Factory in Kayes, were taken hostage during a coordinated armed assault on the factory premises on July 1.A day after the incident, India formally called upon the Mali government to take “all necessary measures” to ensure their “safe and expeditious” release.“The incident occurred on July 1, when a group of armed assailants carried out a coordinated attack at the factory premises and forcibly took three Indian nationals as hostages,” the MEA said.While no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction so far, Al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for multiple coordinated attacks across Mali on the same day.The Indian embassy in Bamako, according to the MEA, is in “close and constant” touch with local authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the management of Diamond Cement Factory. It is also in contact with the families of those kidnapped.“The government of India unequivocally condemns this deplorable act of violence and calls upon the government of the Republic of Mali to take all necessary measures to secure the safe and expeditious release of the abducted Indian nationals,” the MEA said in a statement.It added, “Senior officials of the ministry are closely monitoring the evolving situation and remain engaged at various levels to facilitate safe and early release of Indian nationals.”The government has also advised all Indian citizens currently residing in Mali to “exercise utmost caution, remain vigilant and stay in close contact with the embassy in Bamako for regular updates and necessary assistance.”The MEA reiterated that it “remains committed to ensuring the safe return of the abducted Indian nationals at the earliest” and will provide “all possible support” to them and their families.",India voiced deep concern over the abduction of three of its nationals in mali.

"Early days, but Dalai Lama succession potential friction point in Sino-Indian ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/early-days-but-dalai-lama-succession-potential-friction-point-in-sino-indian-ties/articleshow/122212662.cms,"Dalai Lama (AP photo)

The 14th Dalai Lama’s announcement of a succession plan, ruling out any Chinese role in the matter, set off a firestorm with the Chinese ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, saying in a detailed response that the reincarnation must comply with “religious rituals and historical conventions as well as Chinese laws and regulations”.While it’s still early days, the contentious issue of finding a successor for the revered spiritual leader upon his death can also potentially lead to another flashpoint in India’s relationship with China that has shown several signs of improvement in the past 9 months.Beijing is likely to choose its own successor to the Dalai Lama and will closely follow how India, home to the Tibetan government-in-exile, reacts to the likely dual succession. The Beijing-based China Tibetology Research Center, which is responsible for shaping China’s Tibet policy, warned in 2019 that bilateral ties would be adversely impacted if India chose to disregard the appointment of Dalai Lama through the “traditional” process. Unlike the US though, India has not spoken officially on the succession issue and it’s unlikely it will be in any hurry to do so now.The Center told a visiting Indian media delegation, which included this reporter, that no wise leader or friendly country would do that but also remarked that India can stay away or not publicly endorse the Chinese pick.For China, the Dalai Lama succession is an internal process that has been followed since 1792, when the Qing dynasty apparently introduced it.The Dalai Lama, however, has said in the past that his successor could come from his followers in India and that a Communist China, which rejects religion, should have no role in such religious affairs.Apart from identifying the next Dalai Lama in China, Beijing lists drawing of lots from a golden urn and recognition of the central government as essential elements of finding a successor, saying the current Dalai Lama was himself chosen through the same process.For India, the Dalai Lama remains a spiritual figure - deeply respected even by the Indian people - who has not been allowed to conduct political activities on Indian soil. Beijing, however, has often attributed motives to his spiritual and religious actions and the fact that he has been allowed to visit Arunachal Pradesh that is claimed by China. It was perhaps not a coincidence that the 73-day India-China Doklam military standoff at Doklam in 2017 took place barely a couple of months after the Dalai Lama’s visit to the Indian state.In 2011, the Dalai Lama transferred his political authority to the Tibetan government-in-exile that’s based in India. India has been silent on the succession issue, which will likely be a long-drawn process, unlike the US which maintains that reincarnation is a religious issue with no role for any State in it. While Beijing sees the reincarnation as a matter of Chinese sovereignty, the US believes it’s about religious freedom and human rights and threated to raise the US at the UN in 2019.In his announcement, the Dalai Lama said that only his Trust and ""no one else” has any role to play on the succession issue. Xu said in his response that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni and other grand Living Buddhas must go through the Golden Urn lottery procedure, and selected candidates would be subject to approval by the central government of China.“The practice of Living Buddha reincarnation has continued over 700 years, and has formed rigorous religious rituals and historical conventions,” he said.","The 14th dalai lama’s announcement of a succession plan, ruling out any chinese role in the matter, set off a firestorm. Beijing is likely to choose its own successor to the dalai lama and will closely follow how india, home to the tibetan government-in-exile, reacts to the likely dual succession.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122212787,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1282689,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
