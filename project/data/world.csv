Potential risks to high-rises

Soft Soil Foundation: Bangkok's soft clay soil can amplify seismic waves, increasing the risk of structural damage.

Ageing Infrastructure: Many high-rise buildings were built before modern earthquake-resistant codes were introduced.

Lack of Retrofitting: Some older structures may not have undergone necessary reinforcements to withstand earthquakes.

The recent 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar has left a devastating impact, with over 1,600 confirmed dead and thousands injured. While Myanmar bore the brunt of the destruction, neighbouring Thailand also witnessed significant damage, particularly in Bangkok, where a high-rise under construction collapsed, killing at least 10 people. The collapse has raised serious concerns about the structural integrity of skyscrapers in Thailand and their vulnerability to seismic activity.The earthquake, which struck near Mandalay, sent tremors through Thailand, with the greater Bangkok area experiencing significant shaking. The collapse of the high-rise near Chatuchak market has sparked questions about whether Thailand's skyscrapers are adequately designed to withstand earthquakes.Experts say Thailand’s skyscrapers, particularly in Bangkok, are at risk due to a combination of outdated construction standards and the city’s geological conditions. Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, told the BBC that fewer than 10% of buildings in Bangkok are earthquake-resistant. Although a 2007 law mandates earthquake-resistant designs for new buildings, older structures remain highly vulnerable. Many of these older high-rises were primarily designed to handle wind loads rather than seismic forces, making their ability to withstand quakes uncertain.Compounding the problem is Bangkok’s soft soil, which can amplify ground shaking by three to four times. This effect increases the risk of structural failure, particularly for medium-rise buildings between 10 and 20 storeys, which are more susceptible to resonance effects caused by seismic waves.Experts highlight several factors that could make Thailand’s skyscrapers vulnerable:The British Chamber of Commerce in Thailand had earlier highlighted that Bangkok, though classified as a low seismic risk area, is not immune to earthquake hazards. Past events, such as the 9.1-magnitude Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in 2004 and the 6.8-magnitude Burma earthquake in 2011, demonstrated that tremors could still cause structural damage in Thailand.The 2007 seismic design regulations require buildings taller than 15 metres to be earthquake-resistant. However, implementation has been inconsistent, and many older buildings remain at risk. According to Dr Chusilp, designing medium-rise buildings for earthquakes increases structural costs by 10-15%, which may have deterred developers from upgrading existing structures.","The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck myanmar has left a devastating impact, with over 1,600 confirmed dead and thousands injured.

US Secret Service nixed Pannun plan to serve NSA Ajit Doval summons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-secret-service-nixed-pannun-plan-to-serve-ajit-doval-summons/articleshow/119822944.cms,"NEW DELHI: A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval , who accompanied PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US on February 12-13, was not completed during his stay there, brushing aside Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s claim that he managed to get the notice delivered to the top Indian security official.The court was responding to a letter from Pannun’s lawyer which also revealed that US Secret Service agents guarding the Blair House, where the Indian delegation was put up, threatened to arrest his server when he tried to place the notice on the ground outside what is the president’s guest house. The server could only leave the summons with a nearby Starbucks store that didn’t prove to be enough for the court.After reviewing the letter, a judge of the Southern District of New York said that “the complaint was not delivered to a member of the hotel management or staff or any officers or agents providing security for Defendant (Doval), as required by the court's order”. The development confirms the Indian position that the NSA wasn’t served the summons, which foreign secretary Vikram Misri had described as based on unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations, during his stay in the US.The summons was issued last year in September by a US court in response to a civil lawsuit filed by Pannun about an alleged murder plot against him for which American authorities had blamed an Indian government agent named Vikash Yadav . The Indian government has conducted a probe into the issue and recommended legal action against Yadav. Indian national Nikhil Gupta remains in US custody for his alleged involvement in the plot and his case will go to trial on November 3, 2025.Pannun is said to have hired 2 process servers and one investigator to effect service on Doval in Washington DC during the latter’s 2-day trip to the US. According to the contents of the letter, the first server, identified as Ambiko Wallace, reached Blair House on February 12 at 7.22 pm and found it barricaded with a single checkpoint that was guarded by Secret Service agents. Wallace showed the legal document to an agent, but he would have none of it and forced the server to immediately leave the checkpoint.Another individual named Wayne Engram, apparently a more enterprising process server with 15 years of experience, approached the agents next day at 12.15 pm. As the Secret Service again refused to accept any document, he tried to place the envelope on the ground before them – a “standard method of service” apparently. However, one of the agents told him that he would be arrested if he left the summons on the ground. It was then that Engram decided to leave the documents at the nearest public location where he would not be arrested. This happened to be a Starbucks approximately 100 feet from the checkpoint. “Mr. Engram left the service documents in a sealed envelope in the public seating area outside the Starbucks. Then he went back to the checkpoint, told the agents where he had left the documents, and asked them to please retrieve them and give them to Defendant as soon as possible,’’ says the letter. This clearly proved to be insufficient for the court. While all this was going on, the investigator hired by Pannun also spoke to Blair House staff and Secret Service over phone but was told there was no way to serve the Defendant there. They also refused to share any email that could be used for sharing the summons.The Pannun murder plot threatened to snowball into a major diplomatic row last year, with the Biden administration not just seeking accountability but also backing similar charges by Canada over the murder of another Khalistan leader named Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Having recommended legal action against Yadav and pledging “functional improvements” in the system to deal with a matter like this, India will hope that the case will no longer act as an irritant in bilateral ties. Pannun, who was designated as a terrorist by India in 2020, is the spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a Khalistan group India wants the US to ban.",A us court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to nsa ajit doval was not completed during his stay there.

Impact on India



India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor: The project faces significant challenges in the wake of Trump's threats against Iran. IMEC aims to enhance economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe by bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. However, tensions between the US and Iran could disrupt this ambitious initiative. Trump's aggressive stance against Iran exacerbates regional tensions, threatening trade routes and infrastructure projects. This instability could divert investment away from IMEC, favoring more secure alternatives. As a result, India must navigate these complexities carefully to ensure the corridor's viability and maintain its strategic influence in the region. The project's future hinges on diplomatic efforts to stabilise the region and mitigate the impact of US-Iran tensions on IMEC's development and operations.

Oil imports : India, which was once the largest buyer of Iranian oil, had to seek alternative sources after the US withdrew sanction exemptions for oil imports. Continued sanctions would maintain this status quo, affecting India's energy security and forcing it to rely on more expensive alternatives. India has had to diversify its oil import basket, turning to other suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even the United States to fill the gap.

Trade c hallenges: India and Iran have been negotiating a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) to diversify trade beyond energy. However, US sanctions and tariffs could complicate these efforts by limiting financial transactions and discouraging investments in non-oil sectors. The overall trade between India and Iran has been severely affected by current US sanctions. The bilateral trade volume plummeted from $17 billion in 2018-2019 to a mere $2.3 billion in 2022-2023, representing a staggering decline of over 86%.

Chabahar Port development : The Chabahar Port project, a cornerstone of India-Iran economic engagement, faces potential setbacks due to increased US sanctions and regional tensions. Although the port is considered outside the purview of US sanctions, the overall geopolitical tension and financial restrictions have indirectly affected its development and utilisation. It offers India an alternative route for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, reducing dependence on Pakistan-controlled transit routes. However, US sanctions have made it difficult for international companies and financial institutions to participate in the project, slowing down its progress. Indian investments and operations at the port have continued, but at a reduced pace. The uncertainty surrounding the sanctions regime has also deterred potential partners and investors, limiting the port's growth potential.

Competition from China: China's increasing presence in the region, including a 25-year strategic partnership with Iran, poses a challenge to India's strategic interests. US sanctions could inadvertently strengthen China's position by limiting India's engagement with Iran. There are apprehensions that China might leverage its growing relationship with Iran to gain preferential access to Iranian resources and markets, potentially at the expense of Indian projects.

As part of his 'maximum pressure' approach, US president Donald Trump has threatened Iran with military action if Tehran does not agree to a new nuclear deal with Washington, a move that has hightened tensions in the region and will likely impact India's trade and security interests in the Middle East.The threat was made during a phone interview with NBC News, where Trump stated that if Iran fails to make a deal, there would be ""bombing the likes of which they have never seen before"". Additionally, Trump mentioned the possibility of imposing secondary tariffs on Iran if an agreement is not reached.Iran has responded strongly to these threats.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that if the US acts on Trump's threat, Iran will deliver a ""strong blow"" in retaliation. Iran has also prepared its missile arsenal, with many missiles positioned in underground facilities designed to withstand airstrikes, ready to strike US-linked positions worldwide.Trump's threat came after Iran rejected direct negotiations with the US but said it was open to indirect talks through intermediaries like Oman. The tensions between the US and Iran have escalated significantly since Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, during his first term in office.If Trump's 'maximum pressure' approach against Iran continues, India's trade, ties, and strategic interests with Tehran could be affected.","Imec aims to enhance economic integration between india, the middle east, and europe by bypassing traditional routes like the suez canal.

"Nearly 20 years after nuclear deal, DoE clears US firm to build & design reactors in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-20-years-after-nuclear-deal-doe-clears-us-firm-to-build-design-reactors-in-india/articleshow/119826549.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in the Indo-US nuclear deal that was signed nearly two decades ago, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided regulatory clearance to an American company to build and design nuclear reactors in India .On March 26, 2025, DoE granted Holtec International a critical regulatory approval, allowing the company to transfer small modular reactor (SMR) technology to India. Holtec specialises in the design and manufacture of parts for nuclear reactors and is the world leader in storage and transport casks used for spent nuclear fuel.The DoE approval to Holtec International has been given under conditions that it shares ‘unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology’ with three Indian firms: Holtec Asia (its regional subsidiary), Larsen &Toubro Ltd and Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd. The deal is under the restrictive regulation of the US, ‘10CFR810’, with the approval being valid for 10 years and will be re-evaluated every five years.But the US has set one condition — these jointly-designed and manufactured nuclear power plants “will not be re-transferred to any other entity or end user in India or to other countries except the US without the prior written consent of the Government of the United States”.Holtec had also sought approvals for two Indian govt-owned firms, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and also for Atomic Energy Review Board or AERB. However, the govt of India had not provided required clearances for these state-owned corporations since Holtec had not yet got DoE permission.The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation between the two nations. However, it took nearly 20 years for the deal to kick in due to multiple legal and regulatory challenges.Till now, under the civil nuclear deal, US firms could export nuclear reactors and equipment to India, but forbid them from any design work or manufacturing of nuclear equipment in the country.In mid-Feb, PM Narendra Modi met President Trump and agreed to a new initiative to drive “transformative change across key pillars of cooperation” between the two countries. The two leaders then announced plans to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India. During the talks, Modi and Trump had also committed to leaning into the 123 Agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation the nations signed in 2007.The two leaders then agreed that energy security was fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries by ensuring energy affordability, reliability, and availability in stable energy markets. To help facilitate the joint work decided between Modi and Trump, the Indian govt is considering amendments to India’s Atomic Energy Act of 1962, which bars private investments in India's nuclear power plants.Currently, India has 22 operating reactors, with an installed capacity of 6780 MWe. Among these eighteen reactors are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and four are Light Water Reactors (LWRs). In Feb last year, Kakrapar Unit 4 became India’s newest nuclear power plant to become operational.","The india-us civil nuclear agreement, also known as the 123 agreement, was signed in august 2007 by then pm manmohan singh and then us president george w bush.

Rift or rumour?



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has praised the BJP-led central government for its ""vaccine diplomacy"" during the Covid pandemic years calling it a ""powerful example of international leadership"".In a column titled ""Covid’s silver lining for India"" written for the English magazine The Week, Tharoor said, ""India’s vaccine diplomacy during the Covid pandemic stands out from amid the horrors of that time as a powerful example of international leadership rooted in responsibility and solidarity. By delivering made-in-India vaccines to over 100 nations, India demonstrated its capacity to extend a helping hand when it mattered most.""This has added another positive remark to the list of praises by the veteran Congress leader for the central government. He had recently appreciated PM Modi's anti-war stance on Russia-Ukraine conflict who had said that ""peace cannot be found on the battlefield.""The article comes amid reports of rift between the Congress and the veteran leader over Kerala leadership.Tharoor's article was centered around India's strength as a soft power during those years rooted in the field of technology and training.""Our efforts were not limited merely to the provision of vaccines but extended to the sending of Indian military doctors to Nepal, the Maldives, and Kuwait, and to organising online training for health care workers across South Asian nations. Additionally, through its engagement with global platforms like GAVI, the Quad, and the Pan Africa E-Network, India addressed immediate health concerns while laying the groundwork for long-term international cooperation,"" he wrote.""India’s vaccine diplomacy served as a counterbalance to China’s influence in South Asia and Africa, where both nations were vying for goodwill through vaccine supplies,"" he added.Tharoor lauded the Vaccine Maitri initiative launched by the central government in 2021 which exported vaccines to over 100 countries including nations across West Asia, Africa, Latin America, and our immediate neighbourhood.""Leveraging its position as the world’s vaccine manufacturing hub, India launched the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative in January 2021. This programme aimed to supply Covid-19 vaccines to countries in need, particularly to developing nations. India’s exports of vaccines—both as aid and commercial shipments—reached nations across West Asia, Africa, Latin America, and our immediate neighbourhood,"" he wrote.He, however, did not shy away from calling the lockdown ""stringent"".""No one in India is commemorating the fifth anniversary of the stringent lockdown prompted by Covid-19, which the government imposed on March 24, 2020. We, the survivors, all think of Covid as a bad dream, one marked by suffering, tragedy and loss,"" he said.Tharoor recently made headlines after there were a series of events -- a podcast, selfie, and a cryptic post -- pointing towards his rift with Congress.Last month, in a Malayalam podcast interview, Tharoor had warned that Congress risked staying in opposition in Kerala for a third term if it failed to expand its appeal. He pointed to a leadership vacuum within the state party and suggested he had ""other options"" if Congress no longer needed his services.In an unrelated event, he had posted on X a quote by Thomas Gray-- ""Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise"" -- as the thought of the day.Adding to the buzz, he had shared a selfie with Union minister Piyush Goyal, praising the revival of India-UK FTA negotiations, further intensifying speculation about his political future.However, he later played down the reports of rift saying, ""You all heard the podcast, what was the controversy about?...I still haven't understood the controversy...now that you have heard the whole podcast, can you tell me what your question is, I am happy to respond...it is a podcast, a 45-minute conversation about life and pursuits of Happiness, nothing there much about any political controversy""","Congress mp shashi tharoor has praised the central government for its ""vaccine diplomacy"" during the covid pandemic years.

‘A political death’

Allies, world leaders rally behind Le Pen

Marine Le Pen has been sentenced to four years in prison, with two years to be served under electronic monitoring, and banned from public office for five years following a guilty verdict in an embezzlement case . The ruling, delivered by a Paris court on Monday, has thrown her political future into doubt just three years before the 2027 presidential election.Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally party , left the courtroom in dramatic fashion as the judge read out her sentence. Without waiting for the full ruling, she picked up her bag and briskly exited the chamber, ignoring reporters as she left the courthouse. Earlier, she had appeared composed when the guilty verdict was announced but grew visibly agitated as the court detailed how her party had misused European Parliament funds.Several of Le Pen’s allies were also convicted:Le Pen has condemned the verdict as an attempt to eliminate her from politics, warning that the ruling could disenfranchise millions of her supporters. “This is political death,” she said previously, referring to a possible ineligibility ruling.The court found that Le Pen and her party illegally redirected EU funds meant for parliamentary aides to pay party staff between 2004 and 2016. While the judge acknowledged that Le Pen and her allies did not personally enrich themselves, the ruling described the scheme as “a democratic bypass” that deceived both voters and the European Parliament.Despite the conviction, Le Pen remains a key figure in French politics. Her party’s growing support has made her a serious contender in past elections, finishing as runner-up to President Emmanuel Macron in 2017 and 2022. With her ineligibility now in force, attention turns to Jordan Bardella, her 29-year-old protégé, who could emerge as National Rally’s presidential candidate in 2027.Le Pen has vowed to appeal the ruling, but even if she does, her ban from running for office remains in effect unless overturned.Jordan Bardella, Le Pen’s close ally and president of the National Rally, condemned the ruling as an attack on democracy. ""Today, it is not just Marine Le Pen who is unjustly condemned – it is French democracy that has been executed,"" he wrote on X.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also voiced support for Le Pen, posting ""Je suis Marine!"" in French. His statement followed the court’s decision to sentence Le Pen to four years in prison, two of which will be served under electronic monitoring, and ban her from running for office for five years.The Kremlin also criticised the ruling, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov accusing European governments of undermining democratic norms. ""More and more European capitals are going down the path of violating democratic principles,"" he told reporters when asked about Le Pen’s conviction.","Marine le pen has been sentenced to four years in prison, with two years to be served under electronic monitoring.

Defence experts criticise Yunus over ‘landlocked’ remark

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's interim government chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus , who was on a four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to make an ""extension"" in the region while mentioning that the seven northeastern states of India remain landlocked.In a widely circulated video on social media, Yunus encouraged the Chinese government to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, emphasising that Dhaka is the ""sole guardian of the ocean"" in the region.""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean,"" Yunus said in the video.""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world,"" Yunus said.Sanjeev Sanyal, currently a member of PM Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council, shared the video on X and wrote: ""Interesting that Yunus is making a public appeal to the Chinese on the basis that 7 states in India are land-locked. China is welcome to invest in Bangladesh, but what exactly is the significance of 7 Indian states being landlocked?""Yunus, who met Xi Jinping during his four-day visit, also sought a 50-year master plan from Beijing for its river water management , including that of the Teesta river, co-shared by the Indian upstream region, calling China the “master of water management”.“We have come here to learn from you; how we can make water resources useful to people,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted him as saying.He particularly pointed out the issues related to the 'Teesta River System' but added, however, that “Bangladesh's problem lies not just with one river, but with the (entire) system”.The ousted Hasina government had sought India's involvement in the Teesta River basin project.Meanwhile, Bangladesh and China held positive discussions on signing the Implementation Plan of the MoU on the Exchange of Hydrological Information for the Yarlung Zangbo-Jamuna River, which originates in China and flows into Bangladesh after passing through a significant stretch of Indian territory.The two nations also agreed to enhance maritime cooperation and plan to hold a new round of Dialogue on Maritime Cooperation at a suitable time.""Bangladesh welcomes Chinese companies to participate in the Mongla Port Facilities Modernisation and Expansion Project and is ready to collaborate with China to further develop the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone (CEIZ) in Chattogram,"" the statement said.According to BSS, China has planned to provide approximately $400 million for the modernization of Bangladesh’s southwestern Mongla seaport, $350 million for the development of the China Industrial Economic Zone, and another $150 million as technical assistance.""The remaining funds will be provided as grants and other forms of financial support,"" the BSS report added.Yunus' remarks drew strong reactions from Indian defence experts on Monday.Responding to Yunus' statement, defence expert Dhruv Katoch criticised the mention of India in the discussion. ""He had no business bringing up India,"" Katoch said. ""If we have connectivity issues and how we connect to the oceans, that is a matter for our government, and we are handling it. The Kaladan River project will be completed soon. As far as access to the sea is concerned, we don’t need Bangladesh,"" he said.Katoch also speculated on the motive behind Yunus' remarks, suggesting he was attempting to send a message to both India and China. ""He is trying to tell China that Bangladesh’s unique location could provide China with access through India’s northeastern states to Nepal and Bhutan. But inserting India into the conversation in this way is threatening. Is he indirectly trying to say that Bangladesh could cut off India’s Northeast?""He further noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of BIMSTEC. ""Mr. Yunus has sought a meeting with PM Modi. But India is too big a country to be threatened by any country—Bangladesh is totally irrelevant in that regard,"" Katoch asserted.Meanwhile, in Jammu, retired defence expert Captain Anil Gaur linked Yunus' remarks to Bangladesh’s economic struggles. ""Muhammad Yunus has gone to China to secure funding because Bangladesh's economy has collapsed,"" Gaur claimed. He pointed out that USAID, which previously funded Bangladesh, had ceased support under orders from former U.S. President Donald Trump.""Today, Bangladesh is in a situation similar to what it was before its liberation in 1971. Yunus has no choice but to seek help from China, praise them, and try to sell his country and economy,"" Gaur said. However, he reassured that India has no reason to worry.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the NFL. While the recent events at Super Bowl 2025 might have made them lowkey, they are still very much in love with one another. But it seems like things might change between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift due to newly elected President Donald Trump since the Kansas City Chiefs have now been invited to the White House.While the Chiefs have not issued a statement about it yet, President Donald Trump had once predicted Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s break up.In 2023, in an interview with the Daily Caller, President Donald Trump was asked about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship. President Donald Trump had said, “I wish the best for both of them. I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”Two years later, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have continued to be together, President Donald Trump’s feud with Swift has also continued and gotten worse.The billionaire pop star Taylor Swift has publicly spoken about not supporting Donald Trump. A few months before the 2025 elections, Taylor Swift had publicly supported Kamala Harris when Harris debated with Donald Trump.However, Donald Trump has not held back. He had posted on his Truth Social handle about his feelings for Taylor Swift when she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025, which he was also attending.Donald Trump’s post on his Truth Social handle read as, ""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!""Recently, in an interview with OutKick, Donald Trump spoke about inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House since, due to COVID-19, the team could not make their visit to the White House after they won the Super Bowl in 2020.Donald Trump said, “I look forward to having the (Philadelphia) Eagles (for winning Super Bowl LIX in February). And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of Covid.”While it is not known how Taylor Swift will react to accepting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, visiting the White House when she has been trolled multiple times by President Donald Trump, it remains interesting to see how it changes the couple’s equation or if it will even have an effect on them.Currently, fans are waiting for Taylor Swift to announce the date for the release of her new album while Travis Kelce has not yet confirmed if he would be retiring this season. Fans are also waiting to spot the couple on their date nights because it has been a few weeks since they were last spotted on their date nights.The two started dating in September 2023, and their relationship has been pretty much drama free.
