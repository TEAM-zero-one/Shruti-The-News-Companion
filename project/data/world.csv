NEW DELHI: Former Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday rejected the Delhi exit poll results that projected big win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and placed the ruling party at distant second.""Some agencies are showing that the party of abuse is winning more than 55 seats.

NEW DELHI: Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing an ugly consequence of human-wildlife conflict, with wild a leopard loitering unrestrained in the city, which only last year dealt with the menace of wolves.Five people were injured in Bahraich's Bargadwa village on Thursday in recent incidents of leopard attacks, which have petrified the hamlet.""Leopard attacked five people... it stays in the village and daily takes away dogs as well as children...,"" recounted victim Shankardayal in a conversation with news agency ANI.Panic crept in Bargadwa Thursday morning after a leopard targeted five people, three of whom are being treated and two have been referred for further care.""A case will be filed by tonight and financial assistance will be provided to the injured,"" said Katarniaghat Bahraich DFO B Shivshankar.Regarding the human-wildlife conflict, the forest department advised people not to go alone into sugarcane fields or leave meat or livestock outside.""Leopards tend to avoid groups, so staying in pairs or groups can help prevent attacks,"" Shivshankar said.In 2024, October, villagers in panic-stricken Mahsi tehsil of Bahraich district killed a sixth wolf.According to forest officials, that was the last of the ""killer"" pack that terrorised over 55 villages in the region since March, claiming nine lives and injuring over 50 in a series of wolf attacks.Residents of Tamachpur village said that the wolf had tried to attack a child sleeping next to his mother in the courtyard of a house in the village, but on hearing the mother's screams, the wolf ran away and attacked a goat there.Later, the villagers surrounded the wolf and beat it to death, they said.Earlier on September 10, a fifth wolf was captured as part of the ""Operation Bhediya"" campaign that was ongoing in the region to catch the ""killer"" pack.","Five people were injured in bahraich's bargadwa village on thursday.

"No 'sheesh mahal, AAP-da' jibes in PM Modi's Rajya Sabha speech, focus back on Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-speech-aapda-sheesh-mahal-aap-congress-rahul-gandhi-arvind-kejriwal-delhi-assembly-elections-motion-of-thanks-on-presidents-address/articleshow/117988846.cms,"PM Modi in Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Two speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament in the space of three days ... first a day before the Delhi assembly elections and the second a day after voting in Delhi was over. What was the difference?Well, the second speech had no references to "" sheesh mahal "" and ""AAP-da"" unlike the first one in Lok Sabha during which these two terms were used quite a few times by the Prime Minister. The focus in Rajya Sabha was back on the Congress , and in full force, as it has been in the past in most of the Prime Minister's speeches.In his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi had targeted both Congress, AAP and took digs at their leaders Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal over a range of issues without taking any names.The terms ""sheesh mahal and AAP-da"" - which were used extensively by the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders during campaigning for Delhi assembly elections - were used in the Lok Sabha speech quite a few times.""Sheesh mahal"" was a reference to BJP's charge of splurge of public money by Arvind Kejriwal in the renovation of his CM house. The BJP had released several videos showing Kejriwal's extravagance and opulence in CM house. On the other hand, the term ""AAP-da"" was used by PM Modi in his election rallies to suggest that the AAP government in Delhi was a disaster for its people.In his Lok Sabha speech, PM Modi said: ""Some leaders are focusing on jacuzzi and stylish showers in homes, but our focus is on providing water to every home. After 75 years of independence, 70-75% of the country's population, i.e. more than 16 crore households, did not have tap water connection. Our government has provided tap water to 12 crore families in 5 years and that work is progressing rapidly.""Referring to his government's resolve of helping the poor, PM Modi said ""Earlier, the headlines of the newspapers used to be related to scams and corruption. 10 years have passed and crores of rupees have been saved which has been used for the public. We have taken several steps which have saved a lot of money, but we have not used that money to build a 'sheesh mahal', instead we have used that money to build the nation.""Later, in his speech discussing the government's resolve to help the youth, PM Modi said: ""We have been working continuously by keeping the future of youth in mind. But there are a few parties that are deceiving the youth. They promise allowances at the time of elections but do not fulfill those promises. These parties are 'AAP-da' on the future of youth.""All these references in Prime Minister's Lok Sabha speech were oblique references to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party which was in direct contest with the BJP in Delhi assembly elections. Delhi voted for a new assembly on February 5.PM Modi's second speech today, in Rajya Sabha, did not mention these terms even once. There was no reference to ""sheesh mahal"" or AAP-da in the entire speech. Prime Minister Modi was once again unsparing in his attacks on the Congress.The Prime Minister accused the Congress of adopting a policy of 'family first' and appeasement. He criticised the grand-old-party for having ""hatred and anger"" towards BR Ambedkar and said this was reflected in not giving due recognition like the 'Bharat Ratna' to the architect of India's Constitution.PM Modi also hit out at the economic policies of the Congress government and the 'licence quota raj' that gave rise to corruption and affected the country's economic progress and growth.He also said the entire Hindu community was blamed and its image tarnished across the world for the economic mismanagement and wrong policies of the Congress 'royal family' that led to slow growth, which was coined as the 'Hindu rate of growth'.The Prime Minister also targeted the Congress government for imposing Emergency in the country during which the entire opposition was put behind bars and hand-cuffed. He also cited several examples of film stars, singers and writers against whom action was taken for not lauding the Congress during that time.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders, he said those carrying copies of the Constitution have scant respect for it as he recalled how Nehru amended the Constitution during his first stop-gap government curtailing the freedom of speech and expression of common people and did not even wait for elections in doing so.","Two speeches of prime minister narendra modi in parliament in the space of three days.

He knows how to run the administration. He has got experience both as Prime Minister and chief minister. He is the only tallest leader in the country,” claimed the former PM.Nadda’s denial however sought to set the record straight; he lost no time in refuting the claim, saying that not only has the matter (NDA vice-chairmanship) never come up for discussion within the NDA but that all allies have resolved to stand firmly with the govt led by PM Modi.","Former prime minister h d deve gowda claims chandrababu naidu wanted to be vice-chairman of the ‘nda’ the claim, of course, was immediately denied by leader of the house in rajya sabha j p nadda.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117988913,imgsize-872354,width-400,resizemode-4/117988913.jpg"

Sanctions and political fallout

Congress divided over ICC's role

ICC’s survival at stake?

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to its arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, escalating tensions between the US and the global tribunal.The ICC, which neither the US nor Israel recognizes, accused Netanyahu of war crimes over Israel’s military response in Gaza following the Hamas attack in October 2023. The conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties, including children.“The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel,” the order states, condemning the court for setting a “dangerous precedent” with its warrants against Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. Trump’s action comes as Netanyahu visits Washington, where he met with lawmakers after White House talks earlier in the week.The executive order threatens severe penalties on those involved with the ICC’s prosecution of Israeli leaders, including asset freezes and travel bans for ICC officials and their families. Critics argue these measures will hinder international accountability efforts.“Victims of human rights abuses turn to the ICC when they have nowhere else to go,” said Charlie Hogle of the ACLU. “This order undermines justice and free speech.”Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key figure in shifting US policy toward cautious ICC engagement, now vows to “crush the court” after its move against Netanyahu.“This is a rogue court,” Graham said in December. “I never imagined they’d go after Israel, which has one of the most independent legal systems on the planet.”The ICC previously charged Russian President Vladimir Putin with war crimes in Ukraine, a move the US welcomed. However, the court’s expansion of cases to Israel and Palestine has reignited bipartisan skepticism in Washington.The sanctions could cripple ICC operations by restricting travel and access to US technology. The court, already reeling from a cyberattack last year, faces mounting resistance from European allies who now seek countermeasures to ensure its continued functioning.The US has had a complicated relationship with the ICC since its founding under the Rome Statute in 1998. Trump previously sanctioned ICC officials in 2020 over investigations into US actions in Afghanistan—penalties later lifted by President Joe Biden. With Trump now doubling down on the ICC’s credibility, the court finds itself at a crossroads in global justice.",Former president donald trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the international criminal court.

He praised Trump's decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development, the agency charged with delivering humanitarian assistance overseas, claiming such aid had been used to fund organizations that sought to ""topple"" his government.""Now is the moment when these international networks have to be taken down, they have to be swept away,"" Orban said. ""It is necessary to make their existence legally impossible.""Hungary under Orban has for years enacted crackdowns on NGOs and the country's independent media, passing laws that critics argue seek to stigmatize and hinder groups that provide protection for women and minorities, offer legal and human rights assistance, and expose official corruption.Those efforts ramped up in 2023 when Orban's right-wing populist government launched the Sovereignty Protection Office, an authority tasked with investigating organizations and media outlets it deems to be exerting foreign influence.The office has the power to gather information on any groups or individuals that benefit from foreign funding and influence public debate, and Hungary's secret services can assist in its investigations.But opponents have compared the office to Russia's ""foreign agent"" law, and said it can be used to arbitrarily target government critics, including NGOs and journalists. Anyone convicted of a violation can face prison terms of up to three years.On Friday, Orban said people who work for organizations that received USAID funding could be considered ""agents,"" and described Trump's moves to dismantle the US agency as like a ""cleansing wind"" from what he called the ""Trump tornado.""""All money coming from America should be made public, and those who receive it should have sanctions enacted against them,"" Orban said. ""You cannot accept money from abroad in order to influence Hungarian politics, and this will be legally enforced. Those involved will face legal consequences.""Hungary under Orban has been accused by numerous domestic and international bodies of grave democratic backsliding and of abusing the rights of protected minorities, and also of maintaining a wide system of public corruption and political patronage.The European Union has withheld billions in funding to Hungary over its violations of rule-of-law and democracy standards and its failure to address deficiencies in judicial independence.","Hungary will take legal action to eliminate non-governmental organizations that receive funding from the united states, prime minister viktor orban says.

Declining relations with the US

SA land policy a flashpoint

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa came out in defense of his country during a national address on Thursday, asserting that South Africa would not be bullied.""We are witnessing the rise of nationalism, protectionism, the pursuit of narrow interests, and the decline of common cause,"" Ramaphosa said during his State of the Nation address in Cape Town.""This is the world that we as South Africa, a developing economy, must now navigate, but we are not daunted,"" he said.""We are, as South Africans, a resilient people, and we will not be bullied,"" Ramaphosa said to cheers from some lawmakers in parliament.The South African leader did not make direct reference to the United States or President Donald Trump , who has strongly criticized Ramaphosa's government in recent days.The comments come amid unraveling diplomatic relations between Pretoria and Washington and a day after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he would not be attending the Group of 20 (G20) talks, taking place in Johannesburg later this month.""South Africa is doing very bad things. Expropriating private property. Using G20 to promote 'solidarity, equality, & sustainability,'"" Rubio posted on X. ""In other words: DEI and climate change.""US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked programs focused on DEI, which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, since he returned to the White House for his second term.Rubio's decision to skip the G20 summit comes days after Trump — who is being advised by South African-born Elon Musk — slammed the South African government over an expropriation act signed into law by Ramaphosa last month.According to the Expropriation Bill , the government may in some circumstances offer ""nil compensation"" for property where land is expropriated in the public interest.Trump accused the South African government of confiscating land and ""treating certain classes of people very badly"" and announced that it was cutting all future funding.South Africa has rejected these accusations with the country's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola saying ""there is no arbitrary dispossession of land / private property"" with South Africa's new land reform law.""This law is similar to the Eminent domain laws,"" Lamola said.With eminent domain laws, Lamola is referring to a law used in the US, as well as in other countries, that allows the state or the federal government to take private property for public use.The issue of land is a highly emotive one in a country where historically, racist laws saw black families forcibly removed from their land by the apartheid government.Today, the South African government has to navigate a political tightrope of redressing the injustices of the past while taking into account private land ownership.",South africa's president cyril ramaphosa says country 'will not be bullied' comments come amid unraveling diplomatic relations between pretoria and washington.

A Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train carrying 350 passengers burst into flames near Crum Lynne Station in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, on Thursday evening.The fire, which broke out around 6:15 pm (local time), forced a mass evacuation as thick smoke and flames engulfed a carriage.According to the Daily Mail, passengers noticed smoke just minutes after departing from Philadelphia, with some reporting a strong sulfur-like odour.Passenger Dnasia Buckner was quoted by Fox News who said that the situation escalated quickly, with passengers initially relocating within the train before conductors ordered a full evacuation. ""As people were walking by, they said the train's on fire, but the conductors aren't saying anything,"" she said.According to 6ABC Philadelphia, passengers described the smell becoming increasingly strong before the train came to a stop.Fire crews responded promptly to extinguish the blaze. SEPTA spokesperson Andrew Busch credited the crew for their swift action, stating, ""Very quick action by our crews helped allow this to be a safe outcome"", according to The Mirror.The exact cause of the fire remains under investigation, but Busch noted that it started ""underneath the train"" before spreading, as per 6ABC Philadelphia.The fire disrupted services along the Northeast Corridor, halting Amtrak operations and SEPTA’s Wilmington line. However, CBS Philadelphia reported that full service was restored later that night. SEPTA provided shuttle buses to affected passengers.This incident follows a week of transportation disasters in the US, including a fatal mid-air collision in Washington DC and a Medevac Learjet crash in Philadelphia.

How common is

atheism in Indonesia

?

Rights of non-believers mostly go unnoticed

A rare legal effort to secure rights for atheists and nonbelievers was quashed last month by Indonesia's Constitutional Court, which ruled that a citizen must profess a faith, even a minority one, on official documents, and that marriage must conform to religion.Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, officially recognizes six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. While adherents of minority faiths can face discrimination, atheists and nonbelievers are not even recognized under the law.In 2012, Alexander Aan, a civil servant, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for blasphemy after sharing atheist content on Facebook.Indonesia's criminal code punishes blasphemy and the spread of atheism, although technically, it does not criminalize the absence of religious belief itself.However, non-believers argue that existing laws are selectively enforced to deny them equal protection under the law.In January 2024, the Constitutional Court allowed individuals from minority religious groups not among the officially recognized six to register as non-specified ""believers"" on their identity cards.Campaigners hoped this would pave the way for the inclusion of a ""no religion"" option.However, that hope was dashed after two agnostic activists, Raymond Kamil and Teguh Sugiharto, unsuccessfully petitioned the Constitutional Court in October to allow non-believers the right to leave the religion field blank on official documents.Constitutional Court Justice Arief Hidayat ruled against the petition last month, stating that religious belief is ""a necessity"" under ""Pancasila"" and mandated by the constitution.Pancasila is Indonesia's founding ideology and enshrines belief in a single, supreme deity. Justice Hidayat, a former chief justice, argued that requiring a religious confession constituted a ""proportional restriction"" and was not arbitrary or oppressive.The Constitutional Court also slapped down another petition filed by Kamil and Sugiharto which argued that a provision of the Marriage Law, which stipulates that a marriage is valid only if conducted according to the laws of the relevant religion and belief, was discriminatory.According to local media, Justice Hidayat said in his ruling that the ""absence of provisions for Indonesian citizens to choose not to adhere to a religion or belief,"" validating marriages according to individual religion or belief ""does not constitute discriminatory treatment.""""The court essentially ruled that there is 'no room' for the freedom to be irreligious,"" Ignatius Yordan Nugraha, a scholar at the Hertie School in Berlin wrote on Verfassungsblog, a Germany-based outlet about international constitutional matters.Although atheism is heavily stigmatized, research suggests that non-belief is not uncommon in Indonesia.A study by academic Hanung Sito Rohmawati estimated that around 3.5 million Indonesians are atheists in a population of more than 270 million. The real number is unknown since many non-believers conceal their lack of faith to avoid discrimination, harassment, or prosecution, activists say.Andreas Harsono, a researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told DW that he was not surprised by the Constitutional Court's ruling.Indonesia has seen a rise in Islamic fundamentalism since the fall of authoritarian President Suharto in 1998, and ""the nine judges at the court are not immune from Islamic fundamentalism,"" Harsono said.In a 2010 ruling that upheld laws that criminalize blasphemy, the Constitutional Court stressed ""the principle of all-one divinity as the main principle"" of the law, meaning that religiosity is ""a yardstick … to determine constitutional or unconstitutional law.""The Constitutional Court's ruling against non-belief has drawn little international attention.The rights of minority faiths in Southeast Asia have become a hotly contested issue in recent years, particularly since Myanmar's military began its attempted genocide of the Muslim-minority Rohingya population in 2016.The US government and the German Parliament have been particularly evocative in criticizing the governments of communist Vietnam and Laos for repressing religious minorities.But agnostics and atheists say they receive little international advocacy.A report from NGO Humanists International, ""Humanists At Risk: Action Report 2020,"" documented ""lack of separation between state and religion, as well as an array of tactics used against humanists, atheists and non-religious people"" in several Southeast Asian states, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.Pope Francis did not raise a voice for non-believers during his much-publicized tour of Indonesia last September.A European Union (EU) spokesperson who spoke to DW would not specifically comment on the court ruling.""The EU promotes and supports the right of all individuals to have a religion, to hold a belief, or not to believe, as well as the right to manifest and to change or leave one's religion or belief without fear of violence, persecution, or discrimination,"" the spokesperson said.""We regularly discuss the importance of guaranteeing freedom of religion or belief — including the right not to believe — in appropriate fora such as the EU-Indonesia Human Rights Dialogue,"" the latest edition of which was held in July, the spokesperson added.Despite the legal setbacks, Harsono from HRW believes that progress is still achievable.""It's possible to challenge the ruling,"" he said, referring to the latest Constitutional Court decision, although he admitted that it may take time.""We need to educate people to understand the principle of religious freedom and belief in Indonesia,"" he noted.However, scholar Nugraha reckons that Hidayat's ruling last month ""opens the door to more constitutional petitions against laws that are not in line with pan-religious values.""","Indonesia's constitutional court quashed a rare legal effort to secure rights for atheists and nonbelievers.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday briefed Parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal Indian immigrants from the United States. Clarifying that the deportation process ""was not a new one"" and had been ongoing for several years, Jaishankar informed Rajya Sabha that a total of 15,668 illegal Indian immigrants have been deported to India from the US since 2009.A day earlier, a US military plane carrying 104 deported Indians landed in Amritsar. Rejecting all the opposition's charges, the minister also addressed the ""handcuff"" charges, Jaishankar said deportations by the US are organised and executed by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities and ""the standard operating procedure for deportations by aircraft used by ICE that is effective from 2012, provides for the use of restraints"".""However, we have been informed by ICE that women and children are not restrained. Further, the needs of deportees during transit related to food and other necessities, including possible medical emergencies are attended to,"" he said.During toilet breaks deportees are temporarily unrestrained if needed in that regard, the minister said, adding, ""this is applicable to chartered civilian aircraft as well as military aircraft"".""There has been no change from past procedures for the flight undertaken by the US on February 5, 2025,"" Jaishankar said.First, let's understand how the deportation process works in the US. According to NBC News, the process begins with an arrest.This could happen during a routine traffic stop, a workplace raid, or, in the case of individuals with criminal histories, a raid at the house.Following the arrest, immigrants are transferred to an ICE detention facility, which may be local or a few hours away. ICE currently operates over 100 facilities in the US with the capacity to hold up to 41,500 individuals.Immigrants who have arrived in the US within the past two years may face expedited removal, bypassing an immigration judge and being deported within weeks. Those who have been in the country longer could face years of legal proceedings before deportation for now.If a judge issues a “final order of removal,” the individual is typically flown to one of four staging locations along the southwest border—Mesa, Arizona; Alexandria, Louisiana; and San Antonio and Harlingen, Texas — either on a commercial airline or one of ICE’s 10 planes. At these staging facilities, detainees stay for a few days before being transported back to the airport for deportation.The Trump administration, however, has also started using military planes to deport immigrants. One such aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster, landed in Amritsar with 140 Indian deportees.Both the Houses, however, saw several disruptions by the opposition over the treatment of Indians sent back from the US.Earlier in the day, opposition leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Akhilesh Yadav and those from the Left parties, protested by staging a demonstration in Parliament complex.Some of the opposition leaders protested while wearing handcuffs.Carrying placards that read ""Humans. Not prisoners"", the opposition leaders said they would not tolerate the insult to India and raised slogans such as ""Indians insulted. India won't stay silent"" against the government.""We, the INDIA parties, shall not tolerate the humiliation of Indian nationals,"" they said.","The external affairs minister s jaishankar briefed parliament on the recent deportation of 104 illegal indian immigrants from the united states.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/latest-income-tax-slabs-2025-26-how-much-tax-do-individuals-earning-slightly-above-rs-12-lakh-have-to-pay-marginal-relief-calculations-explained/articleshow/117911656.cms,"Budget 2025 income tax: The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs. 12,75,000/-.

According to the Income Tax Department, in the new tax regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to resident individuals who have taxable income marginally above Rs 12 lakh. The total income till which marginal relief is available is near about Rs 12,75,000/-.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How is the marginal relief computed?

First the tax as per slab rate is computed on the total income. For e.g. tax on the total income of Rs. 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:

Tax payable on total income of Rs. 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.

Now, the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs. 61,500) shall be compared with the amount exceeding total income up to which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs.12,10,000- Rs. 12,00,000]

The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs.10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs. 61,500).

Therefore, in this case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/-= 51,500/-) is allowed.

Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500-Rs 51,500]

For income of Rs 12,50,000, the tax liability reduces from Rs 67,500 to Rs 50,000 with marginal relief.

At Rs 12,70,000 income level, the tax obligation decreases marginally from Rs 70,500 to Rs 70,000 with the relief provision.

At Rs 12,75,000 income, the tax payable is Rs 71,250, and marginal relief becomes inapplicable.

Latest income tax slabs 2025-26 post Budget 2025: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ZERO or NIL tax liability for individuals earning up to Rs 12 lakh in the Union Budget 2025 under the new income tax regime. For salaried individuals, including the standard deduction, this limit is Rs 12.75 lakh under the new regime.But what about individuals with taxable income slightly above Rs 12 lakh? Will they have to pay more income tax than their additional earnings above Rs 12 lakh? Will someone earning Rs 12,10,000 face a Rs 61,500 tax burden versus an individual earning Rs 10,000 less who will pay nothing?There's good news! Here's where the concept of marginal relief comes us. Individuals with income slightly above Rs 12 lakh, which is the nil tax threshold, will receive fair treatment through marginal tax relief.For example, for a person having income of Rs 12, 10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax works out to be Rs 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakh + 10% of 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10,000). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-)Also Read | Income Tax slabs 2025-26: How you can pay ZERO tax with Rs 13.7 lakh salary under new income tax regime The marginal relief is computed in the following manner:-Marginal relief examples:It's important to note that rebate is offered to individuals with taxable income up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime. This is different from marginal relief for taxpayers whose earnings slightly exceed Rs 12 lakh.

Countries Should Have Better Immigration Policies It's a Necessary Enforcement of Immigration Laws

A Gujarati family claims to have 'paid Rs 1cr' to reach US

AMRITSAR/CHANDIGARH: A US military C-17 Globemaster aircraft landed in Punjab's Amritsar Wednesday afternoon with 104 deported Indians , grounding their 'American dream' that led them to stake their all in its pursuit.The Union govt didn't rule out more deportation flights from the US, saying all repatriated citizens whose antecedents had been verified - like in the past under the Biden administration and during Donald Trump's previous stint as President - would be ""accepted back"".Sources said this was the first known instance of the US deploying a military aircraft to send deported immigrants from India back home. On why a C17 was used, a US embassy spokesperson only said the military was supporting the new Trump administration's efforts to expedite the removal of illegal migrants globally. When illegal Indian immigrants were last deported in Oct 2024, US authorities had used a charter flight.The arrivals in Amritsar included 25 women and 13 children. Although no official data was put out, the state-wise break-up based on multiple reports is: Haryana 35, Gujarat 33, Punjab 31, three from UP and 2 from Maharashtra.On speculation about the deportees being handcuffed, a Punjab govt official said, ""Some of them said barring the kids, they were made to wear handcuffs during the flight. I can't confirm it, though."" The military aircraft, which took off from San Antonio in Texas arrived in Amritsar at 1.55pm and returned around 5.15pm.Several of the deportees told a government official at the airport that they were picked up ""at the US-Mexico border about 10 days ago"". Some said they travelled to the US from the UK.Sources involved in the clearance process at the airport said deportees from Punjab and Haryana were sent home by road. Those from Gujarat and other states were scheduled to take flights late Wednesday. A senior police officer said investigators would look into who helped the deportees reach the US and how much money they paid to these illegal immigration agents.""They feel betrayed by whomever they gave money to. A Gujarati family claims to have paid Rs 1 crore to reach the US,"" another official said. An uncle of a youth from a border village of Amritsar said the family sold one-and-a-half acres of land and spent a little over Rs 42 lakh to send his nephew abroad. ""He reached the US via Mexico only a few months ago,"" he said.Charanjit Singh, a retired police inspector in Punjab, was at the airport to receive his grandson Ajaydeep Singh, a resident of Amritsar Cantt. He said the young man was living in a camp before being deported. On whether families of all the deportees were aware about the circumstances of their return, an official said, ""Some requested us not to inform their families.""Special counters had been set up at the airport to process formalities for the deportees. Several police vehicles and buses were sent to the cargo terminal and used to transport the deportees back to their hometowns.",104 deported indians landed in punjab's amritsar wednesday afternoon.

6. $1 million to boost French-speaking LGBTQ groups in Africa

7. $3 million for just “being LGBTQ” in the Caribbean

8. $55,000 for a climate change seminar in Argentina—only for female and LGBTQ journalists

15) Hundreds of thousands of meals sent to al-Qaeda fighters in Syria

16) Hundreds of millions for Afghan Poppy cultivation

17) $14 million in cash vouchers for migrants at the Southern border

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is facing heavy scrutiny after Trump administration crackdown.US President Trump, who has long criticised USAID, signed an executive order pausing foreign assistance for 90 days. “USAID is being run by radical lunatics,” he said, vowing to end what he calls “waste, fraud, and abuse.”Meanwhile, secretary of state Marco Rubio had called USAID a “global charity” that operates with little regard for US national interests. The agency’s Washington headquarters has been temporarily closed and several senior officials have been placed on leave as investigations continue.Recently, house foreign affairs committee chairman Brian Mast and the White House exposed a series of, what they referred to as “wasteful” expenditures under the Biden administration.From funding drag shows in Ecuador to providing cash vouchers for illegal migrants, USAID’s use of taxpayer dollars has raised major concerns about its accountability.Here are some of the spending decisions, that the committee termed as “outrageous”:Yes, you read that right. In the video, Representative Mast claimed that USAID allocated $15 million worth of condoms to the Taliban, an extremist group known for suppressing women's rights. He mocked this expenditure, stating, “I don’t think anybody’s going to die because we don’t give the Taliban any more condoms.”Through the state department, USAID funnelled nearly half a million dollars to promote atheism in Nepal.The US government spent tens of thousands of dollars to fund a transgender-themed opera in Colombia, a move that left many questioning its relevance to American interests.Another eyebrow-raising expenditure, USAID paid for drag performances in Ecuador as part of an LGBTQ cultural initiative. According to the foreign affairs committee, Fundación Diálogo Diverso, an LGBTQ organization in Ecuador, received nearly $75,000 over a period of three years, which includes a $25,000 grant from last year. The organization utilized those funds to host a two-day drag workshop and create a video documenting the event.This massive sum was spent to build a pier in Gaza, allegedly to facilitate humanitarian aid. However, critics argue that it could easily benefit terrorist groups like Hamas, according to The National Desk.Through the State Department, USAID funded LGBTQ activism in West and Central Africa with a $1 million grant, despite many African nations rejecting Western-imposed social policies.USAID reportedly spent $3 million to support LGBTQ individuals in the Caribbean with no clear explanation of how the funds were distributed or why the initiative was necessary.A USAID-funded climate seminar in Argentina had a strict requirement: participants had to be female or LGBTQ journalists, raising concerns about inclusivity and fairness.The White House disclosed that USAID provided $2 million to support sex reassignment surgeries and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, a deeply conservative country.US Taxpayer money was used to promote gender inclusivity within Indonesian coffee businesses, sparking outrage over how such spending aligns with American interests.USAID spent $32,000 to create an LGBTQ-focused comic book in Peru. While it is likely meant to promote inclusivity, critics argue that funding a niche cultural project in South America is a waste of American taxpayer money.USAID has funnelled millions of dollars to EcoHealth Alliance, the organization linked to controversial coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to The White House, USAID provided food aid that allegedly ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria. Critics argue this demonstrates the agency’s lack of control over where US funds actually go.USAID has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on irrigation canals, farming equipment, and fertilizer in Afghanistan—resources that directly benefited the Taliban’s heroin trade. The funding helped sustain one of the world’s largest opium networks, undermining US counter-narcotics efforts.While the US faces its own economic struggles, USAID allocated $14 million in cash vouchers to migrants at the southern border. Critics argue this policy incentivises illegal immigration and misuses taxpayer money that could be spent on domestic priorities.",The us agency for international development (usaid) is facing heavy scrutiny after trump administration crackdown.

The US Senate confirmed Russell Vought on Thursday as the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is involved in a dispute over freezing federal funding for aid programs.Vought was approved by a vote of 53-47 despite opposition from Democrats. Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer called him ""one of the most fringe and hard-right individuals the Senate has seen in a very long time.""The Thursday night vote followed a marathon effort by Democrats to block the nomination, during which they held the Senate floor with speeches for an entire day and night. They warned that Vought was Trump’s ""most dangerous nominee.""""Confirming the most radical nominee with the most extreme agenda to the most important agency in Washington,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in his floor speech. ""A triple-header disaster for hardworking Americans.""Vought previously held the same position during President Donald Trump's first term. At that time, he issued a memo banning taxpayer funds from being used for anti-racism training. Trump has continued to support that policy during his second term.Vought has already been a key figure in Trump's push to reshape the federal government, serving as one of the architects of Project 2025, a conservative plan for Trump’s second term.Vought returns to office as debate continues over an OMB order from last week that halted federal loans, grants, and other assistance.After the order was issued, OMB released a notice saying the freeze had been ""rescinded."" However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the order was still in effect and only the budget office’s memo had been withdrawn.A US district judge temporarily blocked the spending freeze last week and extended the ruling on Monday. The judge said the plaintiffs showed they would suffer ""irreparable harm"" if the order took effect.Democrats argue that Trump is overstepping his authority by trying to stop spending that Congress has already approved.

All users (civil servants, contractors, and grantees) must modify their signature block to follow the appropriate signature block… the signature block should not include additional embellishment.""This change is part of Nasa’s effort to comply with the White House's directives regarding content within government systems.According to 404 Media, an independent journalist-founded media website, Nasa employees were also instructed to remove specific terms from public-facing websites, including ""Indigenous people"" and references to women such as ""women in leadership.""","Us space agency national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) employees have been directed to remove all pronouns from emails and other applications.
