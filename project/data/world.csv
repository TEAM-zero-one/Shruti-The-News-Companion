'Trump coiled around Modi like a snake': Congress renews attack over US President’s ceasefire claims; Pawan Khera says PM 'allergic to Rahul’s advice',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-coiled-around-modi-like-a-snake-congress-renews-attack-over-us-presidents-ceasefire-claims-pawan-khera-says-pm-allergic-to-rahuls-advice/articleshow/122987901.cms,"Pawan Khera and PM Modi (R)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Pawan Khera on Wednesday launched a fresh attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi , invoking US President Donald Trump ’s repeated claims -- including the latest one -- that he mediated a peaceful agreement between India and Pakistan after India's retaliatory strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.Targeting PM Modi over Trump's latest remarks about brokering a ceasefire, Khera said, ""Trump is coiled around Modi like a snake. And yesterday, Rahul Gandhi handed him the perfect chance to wriggle out of the mess. Just say Trump was lying about the ceasefire. Simple, right? But no. Modi is allergic to taking Rahul ji’s advice. And voilà, today the snake is back, coiled tighter than ever, hissing bitter truths into Modi’s ear.""Trump, in his most recent comments on India, also mentioned the anticipated trade deal between the US and India. While answering questions on high tariffs imposed by India, Trump said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country...""Just a day earlier, during the Operation Sindoor debate in Lok Sabha, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had accused the PM Modi- led government of using the military operation to protect the Prime Minister's image.He further challenged PM Modi to call Trump a ""liar"" in Parliament, over the latter's repeated claims of using trade leverage to end the India-Pakistan conflict. ""If Narendra Modi has even 50 per cent of the courage of Indira Gandhi, he should declare in the House that Trump is lying about the ceasefire,"" Rahul Gandhi said.In Parliament, PM Modi responded firmly, saying that no foreign leader had asked India to halt Operation Sindoor, thereby directly countering Trump’s repeated remarks. ""No world leader asked for suspension of Operation Sindoor,"" the PM said. His comment came in response to the opposition’s demand that he show courage and publicly dispute Trump’s statements.","Congress leader pawan khera on wednesday launched a fresh attack on prime minister narendra modi.

In Severo-Kurilsk, a small town south of Kamchatka, people were asked to leave their homes due to the tsunami threat.Tsunami warnings were also issued for Japan, Hawaii, and other parts of the Pacific.

Monsoon session: 'JD Vance warned PM Modi of massive Pakistani attack' - Jaishankar in Lok Sabha during Op Sindoor update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monsoon-session-jd-vance-warned-pm-modi-of-massive-pakistani-attack-jaishankar-in-lok-sabha-during-op-sindoor-update/articleshow/122958308.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday told the Lok Sabha that US Vice President JD Vance personally alerted Prime Minister Narendra Modi about a massive Pakistani attack just hours before it was launched on May 9.Addressing the special debate on Operation Sindoor, Jaishankar said, “I’d like to inform the House that on May 9, Vice President JD Vance called the Prime Minister warning of a massive Pakistani attack expected in the next few hours. The Prime Minister, in his response, made it very clear that if such an attack occurred, it would be met with an appropriate response from our side. The attack did take place but was foiled by our armed forces. ”Jaishankar said the country witnessed a “new normal” in its response to cross-border terrorism and that India’s reply on May 10 was swift and devastating. “Every member has seen satellite pictures of Pakistani airfields. You can see from the state of those airfields what was our answer,” he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. Precision strikes were carried out by Indian forces on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan retaliated with attempted attacks on Indian military positions on May 8, 9 and 10, which were repelled. A major missile aimed at the Adampur airbase was among the threats, but India’s air defence systems, including S-400 and Akash batteries, successfully intercepted them.Jaishankar said the Indian military’s response included targeted strikes on Pakistani airbases, air defence units, command centres and radar sites. By May 10, under diplomatic pressure and facing heavy damage, Pakistan signalled its intent to halt the fighting. India, however, insisted that any request to cease hostilities must come via the official military channel. “On the 10th of May, we received phone calls sharing the impression of other countries that Pakistan was ready to cease the fighting. Our position was, if Pakistan was ready, we needed to get this as a request from the Pakistani side through the DGMO channel. That is exactly how that request came,” Jaishankar said.He also rubbished claims that US President Donald Trump brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan or linked it to trade negotiations. “At no stage in any conversation with the United States was there any linkage with trade and what was going on. Secondly, there was no call between the Prime Minister and President Trump from the 22nd of April... till the 17th of June,” he said, dismissing Trump’s repeated assertions that he mediated the tensions.Jaishankar also pointed out that Indian diplomacy helped secure overwhelming global support for Operation Sindoor. “There are 193 nations in the United Nations, only three countries apart from Pakistan opposed Operation Sindoor,” he noted, adding that countries recognised India’s right to defend itself.He laid out a five-point doctrine that now defines India’s approach to cross-border terrorism: terrorists will not be treated as proxies; cross-border terrorism will be met with appropriate response; talks and terror cannot go hand in hand; India will not yield to nuclear blackmail; and blood and water cannot flow together.As part of the post-attack response, Jaishankar informed the House that the Indus Waters Treaty has been put in abeyance until Pakistan ends its support to terrorism. “It was important to send a clear, strong and resolute message after the Pahalgam terror attack. Our red lines were crossed, and we had to make it very apparent that there would be serious consequences,” he said.India also launched a global diplomatic campaign to expose Pakistan’s long-standing support for terrorism. “Our task, from a diplomatic perspective, was to shape global understanding of the Pahalgam attack,” he said, adding that efforts were made to underline how the attack targeted Kashmir’s economy and attempted to sow communal discord.Jaishankar’s remarks came in response to Opposition criticism, especially from Congress’ Gaurav Gogoi, who cited former US President Trump’s claim of having mediated a ceasefire using trade as leverage. The External Affairs Minister countered this by citing diplomatic records and communications, asserting that India’s position was consistent and based on military-to-military engagement, not third-party intervention.",Us vice president jd vance personally alerted prime minister narendra modi about a massive pakistani attack just hours before it was launched.

Waah re bayan bahaduron!

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday criticised the Congress party for questioning army operations, saying it has long been the party's ""old habit"" to take a negative approach toward the armed forces.Narrating his government's cross-border operations against Pakistan, PM Modi said the Congress party sought proof of the 2017 surgical strikes carried out at terrorist bases in PoJK after the Uri terror attack.During the Lok Sabha debate on Operation Sindoor, PM Modi further said: ""But when they read the public mood, Congress changed tune to claim that their governments too had carried out surgical strikes.""""Opposing the army and showing negativity towards it -- this has been Congress's old attitude. The country just observed Kargil Vijay Diwas , but the nation knows that during its tenure, and even today, Congress has neither accepted the victory of Kargil, nor celebrated Kargil Vijay Diwas, nor honoured Kargil’s glory,"" the PM said.PM Modi also lashed out at the Congress for demanding the photographic evidence after the 2019 Balakot airstrikes, which were carried out after a terrorist attack on an army convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.The Prime Minister claimed that when Pakistan captured IAF pilot Abhinandan, some in India were ""whispering quietly that now Modi is trapped"".""When pilot Abhinandan was captured, it was natural for there to be celebration in Pakistan -- after all, they had caught a pilot from the Indian Air Force.But even here, there were some people whispering quietly... 'Now Modi is trapped, let’s see what Modi does now'. Abhinandan returned -- openly, proudly, and with full honour,"" PM Modi said.""After the Pahalgam attack, when one of our BSF jawans was taken captive by Pakistan, they [Congress ] thought -- Now Modi will be trapped. Now Modi will surely be disgraced. And their ecosystem spread all kinds of narratives on social media. What will happen to the BSF jawan? What will happen to his family? That BSF jawan too returned with honour, pride, and dignity,"" PM Modi said.Praising India's air defence system for neutralising Pakistani drones and missiles ""like straws,"" PM Modi took a jibe at the opposition and said: ""Not just me but the entire country is laughing at you.""""Terrorists are crying, their masterminds are crying and seeing them cry, some people are crying here too. They tried to play a game during surgical strike, it didn't work. During airstrike, they tried playing another game. That didn't work either.

Why is he scared about talking about Trump?”He accused the Prime Minister of hiding behind Pakistan rhetoric instead of addressing serious questions about India’s sovereignty and military decision-making. “When genuine questions are asked by the opposition, he hides behind the Pakistan story,” Venugopal said.Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi echoed this line, claiming the Prime Minister “never said it clearly that Trump was lying” and accused him of failing to name China despite its alleged support to Pakistan. “The whole nation knows that China helped Pakistan in every way, but the Prime Minister and Defence Minister never named China anywhere in their speeches,” Gandhi said.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera added a poetic jab: “Trump slapped (him), but he’s upset with Nehru.Hope he realises in time, that Donald is no friend, but unfaithful.”Earlier, Gandhi had demanded a clear rebuttal to Trump’s repeated assertion that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. “If Modi ji has even 50 per cent of the courage that Indira Gandhi had, then clearly he must say in Parliament Donald Trump is lying,” Gandhi said.Also read: 'Exercise to protect PM's image': Rahul Gandhi on Op Sindoor; dares Modi to call Trump 'liar' He criticised the government for informing Pakistan mid-operation that India had only hit non-military targets and didn’t seek escalation. “That's surrender. Immediate surrender in 30 minutes,” he said, citing Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s own words in the House.During his address in the Lok Sabha, PM Modi on Tuesday told the Lok Sabha that ""no global leader had asked India to halt Operation Sindoor""""India received global support, but the Congress could not support our soldiers' valour,"" he said, criticising the opposition during the debate on the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor. ""No country stopped India from defending itself against terrorism—only three countries backed Pakistan at the UN.""PM Modi also dismissed questions raised over US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire. He clarified that on the night of May 9, “US Vice President (JD Vance) tried to reach out to me 3–4 times, but I was busy with meetings with the armed forces.” When he finally returned the call, Vance warned of a possible Pakistani attack. “I told him that if Pakistan attacks India, our response would be much bigger—we will respond to bullets with cannons. ”He declared that Pakistani airbases hit during the operation were ""still in ICU"" and said the masterminds of the April 22 attack had “sleepless nights.” Emphasising India’s strength, Modi said, “We destroyed terror sites deep inside Pakistan within 22 minutes… drones and missiles made in India exposed Pakistani arms.”He accused Congress of echoing Pakistani propaganda and giving the enemy a “clean chit.”","Pm modi lashes out at congress over operation sindoor.

Poll Do you think the NIA's actions have been adequate in the Pahalgam case? Yes, they are doing their job. No, they need to do more.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday launched a sharp counterattack in the Lok Sabha, responding to Congress MP and former home minister Chidambaram's remarks on the government's handling of the Pahalgam terror attack and the subsequent Operation Sindoor . Defending the Centre's stand, Shah asserted that there was clear evidence linking the attackers to Pakistan.""We have proof - two had Pakistani voter IDs, and even the chocolates they carried were made in Pakistan,"" he said in Parliament.Speaking in a forceful tone, Shah questioned Chidambaram's intent behind raising doubts about Pakistan’s involvement. ""Yesterday they (Congress) were asking us where the terrorists came from and who was responsible for it. Of course, it is our responsibility as we are in power. Yesterday, former Home Minister Chidambaram ji raised the question—what is the proof that the terrorists came from Pakistan? I want to ask him what he will get by saving Pakistan. When he says this, it means they are giving a clean chit to Pakistan..."" Shah said in Parliament.Chidambaram's comments had sparked controversy after he questioned the government's lack of transparency regarding the investigation.""Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them? Why have you not even identified them? Suddenly a news item emerges that we have arrested two or three people who gave them shelter. Now what happened to that?"" he said in a recent interview.He further added, ""The Government is unwilling to disclose what the NIA has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists, where they came from? I mean, for all we know, they could be 'homegrown' terrorists. Why do you assume that they came from Pakistan? There’s no evidence of that. They are also hiding the losses.""Responding point-by-point, Shah laid out the timeline and evidence gathered by investigating agencies. ""...NIA had already arrested those who gave them shelter. Those who fed them were detained. When the terrorists' dead bodies reached Srinagar, they were identified as the three people who carried out the terror attack in Pahalgam... The FSL report of the cartridges from the terror attack was already ready... Yesterday, the rifles of the three terrorists were seized and matched with the FSL reports... Further tests were carried out in Chandigarh yesterday, after that it was confirmed that these three were those who carried out the terror attack..."" he said.Shah also confirmed the identities of the terrorists involved. ""All three terrorists - Suleman, Afghan and Jibran were killed in yesterday's operation. The people who used to supply food to them were detained earlier.

‘Human Suffering Must Not Be...’: India at UNSC Calls for Ceasefire, Humanitarian Relief in Gaza

Poll How should India balance its relations with Israel and support for Palestine? Prioritize diplomatic engagement with both. Support Palestine more openly.

The United States has conveyed its reservations to India about the ongoing UN 2-state conference that it sees as counterproductive to efforts to end the war in Gaza and ensure release of hostages. India is among the 120-odd countries and agencies participating in the conference that has been boycotted by both US and Israel.The US had urged foreign governments to not participate in the conference, as reported by Reuters last month on the basis of a US diplomatic cable seen by the agency. Asked if there had been any contact with India too about the conference, a US embassy spokesperson told TOI that Washington has shared its views with India.“The United States will not participate in this unproductive and ill-timed conference on the two-state solution in New York City. The United States will continue to lead real-world efforts to end the fighting and deliver a permanent peace. We have shared our views on the conference with the Government of India,” said the spokesperson.As the conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia kicked off Monday, the State Department slammed the meeting calling itunproductive, ill-timed and also a publicity stunt that comes in the middle of delicate diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.“Far from promoting peace, the conference will prolong the war, embolden Hamas, and reward its obstruction and undermine real-world efforts to achieve peace,” said spokesperson Tammy Bruce, adding that the US will not participate in this insult but will continue to lead real-world efforts for peace.Bruce mentioned that French President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement of recognition for a Palestinian state, which preceded the conference, was welcomed by Hamas.“This reflects a pattern of counterproductive gestures that only emboldens Hamas, encourages its obstruction of a ceasefire, and greatly undercuts our diplomatic efforts to end the suffering in Gaza, free the hostages, and move the whole Middle East towards a brighter and more prosperous future,” said Bruce.India is participating in the conference, seeking a constructive and forward-leaning engagement and hoping it would pave the way for concrete steps towards achieving a 2-State solutionIndia had also voted in favour of a UNGA resolution last year that announced an international summit in June 2025 to discuss the 2-state solution. However, the conference couldn’t take place last month because of the Iran-Iraq conflict.According to France, the conference aims to chart a path towards the 2-state solution through “concrete measures” proposed by the 8 working groups, which have conducted extensive consultations with UN member-states and civil society. The conference is drawing attention also for the announcement Macron last week that France will recognise the Palestinian state, becoming the first G7 country to do so.Indian ambassador to the UN, P Harish, had in a statement last week in the Security Council strongly called for a ceasefire to be put in place and sought release of all hostages.India, which was among the 19 countries that abstained from voting on a UNGA resolution in June for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, has been in touch with the 8 working groups and is expected to further provide its inputs on the 2-state solution during the conference.On the Gaza issue, India has continued to walk a tightrope between its vital and growing ties with Israel and the traditional support for the Palestinian cause, including the 2-state solution. While the government strongly defends Israel’s right to defend itself from Hamas terrorist attacks, it also expects Israel to follow international law and not target civilians. “India shares historic and strong ties with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. We have always stood by them and our commitment towards the Palestinian cause is unwavering,” said Harish in his remarks in the Council.The ministry of external affairs also reiterated the Indian position in Parliament on Friday that India has always supported a negotiated 2-state solution, towards establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognized borders, living side by side in peace with Israel.",The united states has conveyed its reservations to india about the ongoing un 2-state conference that it sees as counterproductive to efforts to end the war in gaza.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi addressed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, marking a high-stakes continuation of the Operation Sindoor debate which began on the previous day.Union home minister Amit Shah , opening the session, confirmed that the three terrorists killed in Operation Mahadev carried out the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Operation Sindoor (May 7) was India's military retaliation to the Pahalgam attack by Pakistani terrorists.PM Modi noted in his speech that the Indian armed forces took only 22 minutes to avenge April 22 (Pahalgam attack).""I am indebted to the people of the country for showing trust in me during Operation Sindoor,"" the prime minister said, adding that the country, through its unity, thwarted a ""well-planned conspiracy"" to create communal disturbances across the nation.He added that Pakistan expected an Indian retaliation; yet, it failed to stop India's precision strikes on terrorist infrastructure.The PM maintained that no world leader asked India to stop the conflict, and recalled his conversation with US Vice-President JD Vance on May 9.""The US vice-president tried to reach me, he tried for hours but since I was meeting the army I couldn't talk to him. I called him back then he told Pakistan is going to attack.I replied if that is what Pakistan wants then they will pay heavy price.""PM Modi also tore into the Congress, accusing it of believing Pakistan more than its own government and army.Operation Sindoor created ""Sindoor spirit"" throughout the nation, he remarked.The leader of opposition accused the government of ""tying"" the hands of Indian pilots, and alleged that Operation Sindoor was conducted only to ""protect"" the prime minister's image.He added that the Indian Air Force (IAF) ""made no mistake""; it was the government's ""fault"" not to allow the air force to hit Pakistan's military infrastructure on the first night.Gandhi also dared PM Modi to call Donald Trump ""a liar"" over the US president's repeated claims of using trade as leverage to materialise an India-Pakistan, ceasefire and that fighter jets were shot down during the India-Pakistan conflict.""If Narendra Modi has even 50 per cent of the courage of Indira Gandhi, he should declare in the House that Trump is lying about the ceasefire,"" the Raebareli MP stated.He also brought up Trump's lunch with Pakistan's army chief, General Asim Munir, who gave a provocative speech just days before the attack in Pahalgam.""The man behind the Pahalgam terror attack is Pakistan General Asim Munir. Recently, he had a lunch meeting with US President Donald Trump. PM Modi hasn't said anything. He didn't say, 'How dare Mr. Trump invite him to his office.""Shah began with a detailed breakdown of Operation Mahadev and Operation Sindoor, and then turned his attention towards the Congress for terrorist attacks during the party-led UPA era.""Between 2005 and 2011, there were 27 terrorists attacks. What did the Congress government do; they just sent dossiers to Pakistan,"" he said, adding that those who ""nurture their vote bank by saving terrorists"" will not like Prime Minister Narendra Modi's zero tolerance to terror policy.Further, the Union home minister described Pakistan as the ""Congress' mistake.""""Pakistan is Congress' mistake. If they had not accepted partition, there would have been no Pakistan today. PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) exists only because of Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1960, they gave 80 per cent of the Indus waters to Pakistan....In 1971, during the Simla Agreement, they (Congress) forgot about PoK. If they had taken PoK then, we would not have to carry out attacks on camps there now.""Hitting back at Shah, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra called the Pahalgam attack a ""big failure"" of the government and intelligence agencies.""Who will take the responsibility? Has anyone resigned? Did no government agency know that such a dastardly terror attack is going to happen?"" she asked.The Lok Sabha member from Kerala's Wayanad also took on PM Modi over US President Donald Trump announcing the India-Pakistan ceasefire.""For the first time in the history of our country, war is halted and it is not announced by our government or Army but the US president. This reflects the irresponsibility of our prime minister,"" she stated.Further, she accused the government of ""running away from questions"" and asked the government to come clear on India losing fighter aircraft during the conflict.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav joined other opposition leaders in raising the alleged loss of IAF jets, including the French-made Rafale fighters, on the night of Operation Sindoor.""Our finest aircraft,(the ones that were worshipped with lemons and chillies) -- How many of them actually took off?"" Yadav asked, referring to defence minister Rajnath Singh performing 'puja' of a Rafale jet by placing lemons under its wheels and coconut on the top in 2019.He also brought up China's support to its ""all-weather ally"" during the near-war, and asserted that the government ""cannot sweep it under the rug"" that this war against China as well.Further, Yadav questioned the timing of the killing of three Pahalgam terrorists in Operation Mahadev on Monday, and invoked the Pulwama attack, asking the government: “Why has the vehicle that carried explosives before the 2019 attack not been seized yet?”",Prime minister narendra modi and leader of the opposition rahul gandhi addressed the lok sabha on tuesday.
