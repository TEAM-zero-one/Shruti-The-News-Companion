"‘With &lt;1% women being entrepreneurs, India far below global trendline’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-lt1-women-being-entrepreneurs-india-far-below-global-trendline/articleshow/122137634.cms,"NEW DELHI: Less than 1% of Indian women are entrepreneurs, placing India far below the global trendline, a research paper focussed on gender gaps in entrepreneurship in India has highlighted. On the other hand, India aligns with the global pattern for men, with around 3% of working-age men (15–64 years) being entrepreneurs, which is in line with expectations given its income levels.The research draws upon data from the World Bank covering 186 countries in 2022 and points out that India is one of the most significant outliers in terms of low female entrepreneurship, given its stage of economic development.Using nationally representative data, the research paper, presented at NCAER's India Policy Forum on Friday, showed that female labour force participation explained much of the gender gap in self-employment, but not in entrepreneurship, where women remain under-represented. It found large, persistent barriers to firm growth for women, even in richer states—highlighting the need for multidimensional, state-specific policy solutions.Among various data sources, the authors, Gaurav Chiplunkar from University of Virginia and Pinelopi K. Goldberg from Yale University, drew upon data on working-age population -- (21-65 years) in the 2023 round of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). “Overall, 64% of individuals participate in labour but this masks differences across gender: 91% of men participate in labour as compared to only 39% of women, implying that for every 10 men there are only 4.2 women in the labour force,” the paper stated.Furthermore, 35% of men and 12% of women operate own-account enterprises, which makes them self-employed individuals without hired labour.","Less than 1% of indian women are entrepreneurs, placing india far below the global trendline.

First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31 am ET (12.01n pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space, ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme,"" reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate.

He will have a two-year tenure after taking over on July 1. A 1989-batch Punjab cadre IPS officer, Jain succeeds Ravi Sinha, who retires June 30.Jain, currently heading the Aviation Research Centre (ARC) in the agency, is known within the agency as “a man who listens” and “who gets things done,” people who know him closely said. “He is a field-tested man who has sharp thinking and operates in silence without much hullabaloo,” said an officer.Jain was the field commissioner in the cabinet secretariat (official name for RAW) and posted in Jammu during the air strikes in Balakot and abrogation of Article 370. His key stints were in Nepal, Canada, where his team tracked Khalistani outfits and their members, and in Sri Lanka during its economic crisis.“In his new role, he will prioritise leveraging technology for advanced intelligence collection, monitoring diaspora communities, and developing strategies to counter hybrid warfare tactics, particularly in response to the escalating threats of disinformation warfare posed by China and Pakistan,” a govt officer said.With experience in leading the Pakistan and Canada desks, Jain has been an asset for the agency for the last 14 years, spearheading many technical-and-human-intelligence-based operations, sources said.As chief of ARC in the cabinet secretariat, Jain is credited with the introduction of new technology in unmanned surveillance using drones, besides aerial monitoring to support special operations.While Jain has his task cut out as the head of the agency, China and Pakistan post-Op Sindoor are being considered his key focus areas.

“From space, one cannot see borders—there are no visible boundaries between nations. What stood out most was the sheer unity of the planet,” Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video interaction from the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday.“When we look at maps, we compare the sizes of countries, including India, and often see a distorted picture because we’re flattening a three-dimensional world onto paper,” he said. “But from space, India appears truly grand—majestic in scale and spirit.”Shukla, the first Indian to reach the ISS, said this overwhelming sense of oneness aligns perfectly with India’s civilisational motto of unity in diversity.“From above, Earth looks like a single home shared by all, reminding humanity of the harmony and connection we inherently share.” PM Modi congratulated him for “hoisting the flag of India in space” and said: “Although you are the farthest from the Indian motherland, you are the closest to the hearts of all Indians.”He added, “Today I can say with confidence that this is the first chapter of success of India’s Gaganyaan mission . Your historic journey is not just limited to space—it will give speed and new vigour to our journey of Viksit Bharat.”Calling science and spirituality the twin strengths of India, the PM said, “With the success of the Chandrayaan mission, there is renewed interest in science among children and youth.Now your historic journey is giving more power to this resolve.”In response, Shukla said, “This is not just my personal journey—it reflects the direction in which India is advancing. Under your leadership, today’s India enables the realisation of dreams that once seemed impossible.”He spoke of the challenges in adapting to microgravity. “Even the smallest tasks are complex. I’ve strapped my feet down just to stay in place during this conversation!” he said, adding that one could sleep on the wall, ceiling or “even on the forehead” since orientation is fluid in orbit.When asked whether meditation and mindfulness had helped, Shukla agreed: “As you rightly said, science and spirituality are both our nation’s strength. The calmer you are, the better your decisions. One cannot eat while running. In space, inner calm is crucial.”The astronaut also shared details of the scientific experiments he’s carrying out. “For the first time, Indian scientists have designed seven unique experiments for the space station,” he said. One experiment uses stem cells to study muscle loss in microgravity and could help the elderly on Earth. Another focuses on cultivating highly nutritious microalgae to support food security. “Processes occur faster in space, which accelerates research,” Shukla said.PM Modi praised these efforts and said Shukla’s journey would inspire young Indians. “Today’s children don’t just look at the sky—they believe they can reach it. This mindset is the foundation of India’s future missions.”The Prime Minister added that “India must move forward with Mission Gaganyaan, build its own space station, and achieve the landing of an Indian astronaut on the Moon.” He also expressed confidence that Shukla was “diligently recording his observations and learnings”.Shukla confirmed that he had been absorbing every detail “like a sponge” and said his international colleagues had expressed interest in being part of Gaganyaan. “I told them, ‘Very soon,’” he said, promising to apply his learnings fully to accelerate India’s upcoming missions.He closed by addressing India’s youth: “There’s no one path to success, but if you never stop trying, it will come—sooner or later.”PM Modi concluded: “India is opening new frontiers in space for the world… The sky is no longer the limit.”","Shubhanshu shukla is the first indian to reach the international space station.

Socialism was also never truly our economic vision, our focus has always been on Sarvodaya Antyodaya,"" Biswa said.""So, I request the Government of India to remove these two words, secularism and socialism, from the Preamble, as they were not part of the original Constitution and were added later by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,"" he added.This comes a day after Hosabale proposed that the words ""socialist"" and ""secular"" were forcibly added to the Constitution and should now be reconsidered.""The Emergency wasn't just a misuse of power, but an attempt to crush civil liberties. Millions were imprisoned, and freedom of the press was suppressed."" He said that those who imposed the Emergency and trampled the Constitution and democracy have never apologised.The words ""socialist"", ""secular"", and ""integrity"" were inserted into the Preamble under the 42nd Constitutional Amendment moved by the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi government in 1976.The amendment changed the description of India in the Preamble from a ""sovereign, democratic republic"" to a ""sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.""Earlier, the Supreme Court dismissed a plea challenging the inclusion of the words ""socialist"", ""secular"", and ""integrity"" to the Preamble of the Constitution.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said amendment power of the Parliament extends to the Preamble as well, and the fact that the Constitution was adopted in 1949 does not make any difference.","Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma backed rss's suggestion to restore the preamble of the constitution.

It takes some time to get used to this environment,” Shukla told the PM, while adding, “Right now, we are travelling at a speed of 28,000 kmph and I am talking to you with my legs tied. ” “This speed reflects how fast our nation is progressing and now, we must go even beyond this,” he said.The astronaut said the space station orbits Earth 16 times a day and that he is privileged to witness 16 sunrises and 16 sunsets every day.Also read: Nostalgia hits hard: 41 years after Rakesh Sharma's 'saare jahan se acha', Shubhanshu Shukla calls India 'majestic' from space While referring the astronaut as “Shux”, PM gave him “homework”, telling him to learn as much as possible because the lessons learnt from this Axiom-4 mission “will have to be extensively used in the Gaganyaan mission , our own Bharatiya Antariksh Station and also for landing an Indian on the Moon.” Shukla told Modi that he is “absorbing experiences at ISS like a sponge”.When the PM asked about Indian delicacies he carried to space and whether he shared them with his space mates, Shukla said he is carrying “gajar ka halwa, moong dal halwa, and aamras into orbit”. “I wanted my fellow crew members from other countries to taste India’s heritage. We all sat together and enjoyed it. They loved it,” Shukla said.Shukla shared his reflections from space — on science, struggle, and the boundless dreams of a rising nation. The call was more than ceremonial. It was a glimpse into how India’s spacefaring ambitions have matured. Modi described Shukla’s journey not as a solitary voyage but as India’s own orbit of progress. “When I was a child, I never imagined I could become an astronaut. But today, modern India enables the realisation of such dreams,” Shukla said.Also read: India's time in space: Axiom-4 lifts off; how Dragon will put Shubhanshu Shukla inside ISS When asked by Modi about microgravity tests he will carry out on ISS, especially from the medicine and agriculture sectors, Shukla said, he “will do seven experiments”. “Today, I am going to do a test on stem cells. I am doing a test on supplements to see if such supplements can help prevent muscle loss. This will help people in old age who are losing muscle due to ageing,” he said. Another test explores the cultivation of nutrient-rich microalgae, which could boost food security back home. “The advantage of space,” he said, “is that processes happen quickly. That accelerates research and inspires children back home to say, ‘I can go there too’.”PM Modi asked what message he would send to India’s youth. Shukla responded with clarity and conviction: “Never stop trying. Whether today or tomorrow, success will come if you don’t give up. This is just the first chapter of India’s space story. We’ll build our own space station. We’ll land Indian astronauts on the Moon. And, I’m documenting everything—every lesson I learn will help others fly sooner.”His final words struck a chord destined to echo across classrooms, command centres and quiet corners of the country: “The sky is never the limit—not for me, not for you, and not for India.”‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ chant filled up the space station as the PM raised the slogan towards the end of the 18-minute conversation, which was reciprocated by Shukla.","Indian astronaut shubhanshu shukla has his first interaction with the pm through a video link from the international space station. “the first thing i saw was earth — it looks perfectly unified.

A strong step towards national security Boosts India’s strategic global standing

NEW DELHI: Russia on Thursday assured India it will deliver the two remaining squadrons of the S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, which played a crucial role during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan last month, by 2026-27.The delivery of the fourth and fifth squadrons of the S-400 air defence systems, which has been hugely delayed due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, figured in the bilateral meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart Andrey Belousov on the side-lines of the SCO defence ministers’ meet at Qingdao in China, sources told TOI.“We had insightful deliberations on boosting India-Russia defence ties,” Singh posted on `X’. Under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, India was slated to get all the five squadrons by end-2023.Each S-400 squadron has two missile batteries with 128 missiles each, with interception ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380-km, as well as long-range acquisition and engagement radars and all-terrain transporter-erector vehicles.The IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons in north-west and east India to cater for both China and Pakistan.“As per Russia, the fourth squadron will now come next year, and the fifth in 2027,” a source said.During the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10, Pakistan had claimed it successfully bombed the Adampur air-base and destroyed a S-400 battery deployed there.But PM Narendra Modi visited the air-base on May 13, and posed with an all-terrain transporter-erector-launcher vehicle of the S-400 system in the background to reject the claim.The S-400 batteries, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380-km, constitute the outermost layer of India’s integrated air defence system and is fully plugged into the IAF’s integrated air command and control system (IACCS).The DRDO, on its part, is also developing an air defence system with a 350-km interception range under the ambitious Project Kusha. With the defence ministry in Sept 2023 approving the “acceptance of necessity” for the procurement of five of its squadrons for the IAF at a cost of Rs 21,700 crore, India plans to operationally deploy this system by 2028-2029, as was first reported by TOI.","The delivery of the fourth and fifth squadrons of the s-400 air defence systems has been hugely delayed due to the ongoing russia-ukraine war.

Poll What should be the priority in India-China relations going forward? Resolving the border issue through a permanent roadmap Rebuilding trust and ensuring long-term peace along the LAC

NEW DELHI: India has asked China to constructively work towards a ""permanent solution"" to the border issue under a structured roadmap to bridge trust deficit, de-escalate tensions and rejuvenate the existing mechanism to demarcate it, even as their armies continue to be forward deployed against each other along the frontier for the last five years.Defence minister Rajnath Singh also told his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, on the sidelines of the SCO conclave Thursday that Beijing should understand and respect India's ""principled approach"" to defend itself against cross-border terror sponsored by Pakistan, officials told TOI.Briefing Admiral Dong about the ""heinous"" Pahalgam massacre and the subsequent Operation Sindoor launched by India against terrorist networks in Pakistan, Singh said both New Delhi and Beijing should ""avoid adding new complexities"" to their bilateral relationship.his came in the backdrop of Pakistan using a wide array of Chinese weapons, including J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, against India during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10. Under their deep military collusiveness, China is now also going to supply Pakistan with at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets and HQ-19 long-range air defence missile systems. The hour-long meeting, however, mainly focussed on the need to maintain peace and tranquillity along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC), with Singh stressing the need for ""solving the complex issues through a structured roadmap of permanent engagement and de-escalation"".India's repeated use of 'permanent' represents a new push for resolving the decades-old festering border dispute. Acknowledging efforts by both sides to bring back a ""semblance of normalcy"" in bilateral ties, Singh also put forward a four-point plan to put the overall relationship on an upward trajectory, officials told TOI.This involves both sides first strictly adhering to the plan that led to troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation. They should now move forward to the next steps of de-escalation and de-induction of troops from their forward deployments along the LAC.The two countries should also accelerate efforts to achieve the goal of demarcation and delimitation of the border and register concrete progress in the existing special representatives (SR) level mechanism to achieve a fair and mutually-acceptable solution to the boundary question and other issues.The forward momentum in bilateral ties has gained ground since national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi discussed various issues under the SR mechanism in Beijing last Dec for the first time since 2019.""Singh said India and China should not remain stuck in the past. He called for bridging the trust deficit created after the border standoff in 2020 by taking action on the ground,"" an official said.""The two ministers agreed to continue consultations at various levels to achieve progress on issues related to disengagement, de-escalation, border management and eventual de-limitation through existing mechanisms,"" he added.","Rajnath singh told his chinese counterpart, admiral dong jun, on the sidelines of the sco conclave thursday that beijing should understand and respect india's ""principled approach"" to defend itself against cross-border terror.

What is Indus Waters Treaty?

NEW DELHI: India on Friday dismissed the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal, firmly rejecting its authority.The ministry of external affairs snubbed the “supplemental award” by the ""illegal"" Court of Arbitration for asserting its authority to hear the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower cases in Jammu and Kashmir.The ministry also highlighted that the court was constituted in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.Supplemental award issued by the Court of Arbitration refers to a follow-up decision specifically on whether the tribunal has the legal authority (competence) to hear the case about India’s Kishenganga and Ratle projects, not on the projects themselves, but on the court’s jurisdiction.""India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,"" the MEA said in its statement .After the Pakistan-backed terrorist attack in Pahalgam, the government placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.In a strong statement, the foreign ministry said the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.""Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under it,"" the statement said.""India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body,"" the issue read.Calling the move a ""charade at Pakistan’s behest"", the government called the ""supplemental award"" another desperate attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.""Pakistan's resort to this fabricated arbitration mechanism is consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums,"" the ministry added.This year in January, a neutral expert upheld India's stand after seven questions were raised in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects on matters related to the Indus water treaty.""India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven (07) questions that were referred to the Neutral Expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the Treaty,"" MEA said after the decision.""It has been India’s consistent and principled position that the Neutral Expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences. Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,"" it added.In 2017, the World Bank, which is the facilitator of the treaty, had said that India was allowed to construct hydroelectric power facilities on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers with certain restrictions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan.India is, however, permitted to use the water of western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.Though India has right to create water storage capacity up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers as per IWT, not enough storage capacity has been created. Besides, out of estimated power potential of 20,000 MW, which can be harnessed from power projects on western rivers, only 3,482 MW capacity has been constructed.","India rejects the court of arbitration under the 1960 indus waters treaty as illegal.

What does ‘changing the DNA’ look like for Leafs?

Player insight reveals deeper pressure behind departure



Toronto Maple Leafs era ends as Mitch Marner moves on



Mitch Marner's impending departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs, added an emotional twist to the 2025 offseason. As for many years, Marner has been a mainstay in Toronto's top lines, producing two-way play of the highest calibre. His farewell, a nostalgic media appearance. Also with past-tense references, fans and analysts believe the writing is on the wall.Mitch Marner’s expected departure is more than just a roster change. It necessitates a comprehensive reassessment of Toronto’s structure, identity, and short-term objectives. The club now has a rare opportunity to reset over $10 million in cap space and recalibrate a roster that has long underperformed in the playoffs, especially in high-pressure postseason moments where offensive depth and defensive reliability often faltered.Trade and free agent speculation will dominate the coming weeks, with potential targets like Elias Lindholm or Martin Necas being floated but nothing can truly replace the consistency and chemistry Marner brought to the Maple Leafs lineup.What truly made Marner’s farewell resonate was his candid reflection on the off-ice toll of playing in Toronto. He spoke of the strain on his family, especially his wife Stephanie, as the hockey-mad city often directed its frustrations toward him during playoff losses.The stress of being a high-profile figure in a market as intense as Toronto likely played a large part in his decision, and the opportunity to play elsewhere, in a quieter market like Anaheim or Seattle. This could bring the balance and freedom his personal life demands.For Marner, this isn’t just a hockey decision, it’s a personal pivot aimed at preserving both performance and well-being in the next chapter of his NHL career.Mitch Marner’s career with the Maple Leafs was more than numbers.

MUMBAI: A Mumbai-bound Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa made an emergency landing in the city at 1.42am on Friday after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft experienced a depressurisation problem.""On landing, seven passengers were attended to by the airport medical team for decompression-related symptoms, out of which one required hospitalisation,"" a source said.The incident comes days after 11 flyers, including 6 crew members, felt dizzy and nauseous during an Air India Heathrow-Mumbai flight operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft on June 23. The cause for the illness is under probe.Sources said Friday's incident occurred on flight ET640, when the aircraft (ET-AXS) was overflying the Arabian Sea. It was cruising at 33,000 feet when the cabin depressurisation took place and the pilots executed a rapid descent to a lower altitude, according to data from Flightradar24.For human survival, aircraft cabins are sealed and pressurised with conditioned air and oxygen. This allows aircraft to fly at higher altitudes where oxygen levels are low.However, on rare occasions, the pressurisation system can fail. The pressure and oxygen level in the cabin will then drop, and oxygen masks deploy from the overhead panel.","Mumbai-bound ethiopian airlines flight from addis ababa made an emergency landing.

James Harden faces lawsuit from Houston party incident while Los Angeles Clippers await his decision

James Harden may be lighting up Paris Fashion Week with style and swagger, but trouble is brewing behind the scenes. As fans obsess over his bold fashion statements, a serious lawsuit tied to an incident at his Houston home has surfaced. And just days before a critical decision with the Los Angeles Clippers, the timing couldn’t be more intense.On June 24, a lawsuit was lodged in Harris County, Texas, accusing James Harden of negligence following an alleged sexual assault that happened at his Houston home on New Year’s Day 2025. The plaintiff, Marisa Watley, alleges that she and two friends were drugged by Harden’s nephew, Justice Armani Blackburn, and that the security personnel at Buffalo did not prevent the assault or permit her friends to re-enter the house to assist her. The suit is asking for over $100,000 in damages and claims that Harden is vicariously liable due to the inaction of his security team.As legal issues hover, Harden grabbed attention with his fashionable look at Paris Fashion Week. He shared a photo with the caption “Paris Fashion Week, I went all Luther V I feel like Vandross #Uno,” he drew reactions ranging from 🐐 emojis to fashion praise. Fans implored him to return to Houston, with comments like “That jacket so 🔥” brightening up his feed.Simultaneously, teammates Kawhi Leonard and Russell Westbrook were noticed, making a cultural impact that for the moment overshadowed the courtroom stress.In the midst of the legal turmoil, Harden is faced with a crucial athletic decision that could shape his career. By June 29, he has to choose whether to pick up his $36.3 million player option for the 2025–26 season with the Clippers. After a 50-win season and a first-round playoff exit against the Denver Nuggets, the Clippers are banking on him opting out to pursue a longer-term contract. With four main players approaching or over 30, LA is eager to secure their veteran star before the free agency buzz intensifies.Also Read: “Day 45… this is some bull**” — Jayson Tatum Gets Real About How Tough Achilles Rehab Has Been At 35, Harden continues to be an essential offensive force — he averaged nearly 23 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists in 79 games, earning All-NBA recognition.
