Israel presses India for a ban on Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-presses-india-for-a-ban-on-hamas/articleshow/118692235.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid its ongoing effort to clear out the Gaza Strip of Hamas, Israel continues to press India for the group's designation as a terrorist organisation. The immediate provocation on this occasion for seeking its listing as a terror group is the presence of several Hamas leaders in POK last month on "" Kashmir Solidarity Day "".This was possibly the first time that Hamas leaders, who were joined by members of UN proscribed terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), travelled to POK. Israel is learnt to have discussed this with the Indian authorities. Despite its unqualified support for Israel on terrorism, and strong condemnation of the October 7 2023 terror attacks on Israel, India has not banned Hamas, even as many countries, including the US and EU, have designated it as a terrorist organisation.In 2023, Israel had banned Pakistan-based LeT, which carried out the Mumbai attacks. Israel's then ambassador to India Naor Gilon had expressed hope India too would proscribe Hamas, saying information about the group's terrorist activities had been shared with Indian govt.Whether or not there's a proposal to ban Hamas is a question that has also been raised in Indian Parliament, but external affairs ministry has responded so by only saying that designation of an organisation as terrorist is covered under UAPA and is considered as per provisions of the Act by relevant govt departments.In a fine balancing act, India, while backing Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, has continued to maintain its ties with Palestinian people, reiterating support for a negotiated two-state solution, and establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine within secure and recognised borders, living side by side in peace with Israel. India also supports Palestine's membership of the UN.","Israel continues to press india for the group's designation as a terrorist organisation.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued a stern warning to comedian Samay Raina for making remarks in Canada regarding the ongoing case related to the controversy surrounding his show ' India’s Got Latent '. Justice Surya Kant blasted Raina for discussing the case and cautioned him against taking the court lightly.""These youngsters may think that we are outdated, but we know how to deal with them. Don't take the court lightly,"" Justice Surya Kant said during the hearing.The court was hearing a petition related to podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia who triggered outrage last month with his controversial remarks on sex and parents on Raina’s show. Multiple complaints against Allahbadia, Raina, Ashish Chanchlani, Apoorva Mukhija and others were filed after nationwide outrage.Raina, at the end of his show during Canada last month, had joked with the audience, saying, “Thanks for paying my lawyer’s fees.”While the Supreme Court had earlier barred Allahbadia from shooting any more shows of his podcast, it now allowed him to resume his podcast, The Ranveer Show. The court emphasised the need to balance morality and freedom of expression and urged the Centre to consider this while drafting digital content guidelines.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh took note of Allahbadia's submission that the podcast was his only source of livelihood and around 280 people employed by him were dependent on the show.The bench also extended the interim protection from arrest granted to Allahbadia till further orders, while asking him to join investigation in Guwahati.",Sc allows allahbadia to resume podcast 'the ranveer show' justice surya kant blasted raina for discussing the case and cautioned him against taking the court lightly.

India-Bangladesh ties in ‘good shape’ despite ‘misunderstandings’: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-bangladesh-ties-in-good-shape-despite-misunderstandings-bangladesh-chief-adviser-muhammad-yunus/articleshow/118691927.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (File photo)

Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that relations between Bangladesh and India “remain positive”, with no deterioration in bilateral ties , despite “some challenges” arising from “propaganda”.“Some conflicts had been seen mid-way. I would say, some clouds were seen. These clouds mostly came through propaganda. Others will judge the sources,” he said as the interim government in Dhaka is set to complete seven months in office.“We are trying to overcome these misunderstandings. There is no problem in our basic relationship (with India),” Yunus told BBC Bangla in an interview. New Delhi’s response to his statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen. India had repeatedly cited targeted attacks on Hindus, their temples and businesses in Bangladesh since the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina on August 5 last year, a charge Yunus denied on different occasions.In Monday’s interview, Yunus said relations between Bangladesh and India is “historically, politically and economically” so deep that even after the recent untoward events, they remained “in good shape” and “will remain good in the future”.He said, “There is no alternative to maintaining good relations... no scope of deviating from them.” Highlighting the “huge interdependence” between the two neighbours, Yunus said there is “continuous communication” between them.He also spoke about the law-and order situation, reforms and elections, the formation of a new student party, and political developments in Bangladesh.",Chief adviser muhammad yunus says relations between bangladesh and india ‘remain positive’ despite ‘some challenges’ arising from “propaganda’ new delhi’s response to yunus’ statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-570310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Prevalence of excess weight among Indians up nearly five-fold in 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prevalence-of-excess-weight-among-indians-up-nearly-five-fold-in-30-years/articleshow/118692424.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Prevalence of excess weight among people in India has gone up nearly five times in the past 30 years - from approximately 53 million in 1990 to 236 million in 2021, claims a new study published in The Lancet.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, the study warns, the overweight and obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 521 million (projected) - the second highest globally, by 2050. China, which was estimated to have approximately 464 million overweight or obese persons in 2021, is likely to have the highest number of persons with the lifestyle disorder at 696 million (projected) in the next 30 years, the study suggests.The study is based on an analysis of 1,350 unique data sources, including all major multi-country and national survey data. For individuals older than 18 years, overweight has been defined as having a BMI of 25 kg/m² to less than 30 kg/m² and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher. For individuals younger than 18 years, the definitions were based on the International Obesity Task Force criteria.Importantly, the authors note that more recent generations are gaining weight faster than previous ones and obesity is occurring earlier, increasing the risk of complications such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and multiple cancers occurring at younger ages.For example, in high-income countries, approximately 7% of men born in the 1960s were living with obesity at the age of 25, but this increased to around 16% for men born in the 1990s and is forecast to reach 25% for men born in 2015.The authors have called for a five-year action plan (2025-30) to curb the rise in obesity globally and help form new goals and targets for the post-2030 Sustainable Development Goal-era. ""Preventing obesity must be at the forefront of policies in low- and middle-income countries,"" said co-lead author Dr Jessica Kerr.""Policy action in these regions must balance the challenges of over-nutrition with under-nutrition and stunting, with interventions ranging from support for nutritional diets and regulating ultra-processed foods to promoting maternal and child health programmes that encourage pregnant women to follow a healthy diet and breastfeed. This is no time for business as usual. Many countries only have a short window of opportunity to stop much greater numbers shifting from overweight to obesity,"" she said.Kerr stressed on the need to transform diets within sustainable global food systems and to support comprehensive strategies that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it is too much processed food or not enough parks.Recently, PM Narendra Modi raised the issue of growing incidence of obesity in the country and suggests ways, including reduction of intake of cooking oil in all households, to curb the problem.","Prevalence of excess weight among people in india has gone up nearly five times in the past 30 years.

NEW DELHI: Visa applications from India finally surpassed pre-Covid 2019 levels in 2024, by 4%, said visa sourcing and technology service provider VFS Global on Monday. About 65 lakh visa application were filed in India in 2019, say industry sources. The number did not reach that mark until last year, when it touched about 67.6 lakh.Govt data shows over 3 crore Indians travelled abroad in 2024, 8.4% more than 2023's 2.8 crore & 12.3% more than 2019's 2.7 crore.However, the number of foreigners coming to India is yet to recover. As per Union tourism ministry data, 2024 saw almost 96.6 lakh foreign tourist arrivals, 1.4% higher than 2023's 95.2 lakh but still 11.6% lower than 2019's 1.1 crore.The Indian travel industry has been waiting for inbound recovery but that is yet to happen. While developments in Bangladesh, India's biggest source country for inbound travels, dealt a further blow to the delayed recovery, the industry says FTA estimates need a relook. For, these include the large Indian diaspora coming home for various reasons and the growing expat community that now works in the country.""In reality, the foreign tourist numbers are only a fraction of the FTA numbers,"" Rajiv Mehra, president of inbound tour operators association IATO, recently told TOI.VFS said the popular destinations for Indian travellers last year included Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, US and UK. ""India continues to show a strong demand for international travel, and it's clear that this robust momentum will persist in 2025,"" said Yummi Talwar, VFS Global COO (South Asia).","Visa applications from india finally surpassed pre-covid 2019 levels in 2024, by 4%.

"Need norms, not censorship: SC to government in Allahbadia case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-norms-not-censorship-sc-to-government-in-allahbadia-case/articleshow/118692098.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC on Monday ruled out censorship of freedom of speech and said it remained sacrosanct if it conformed to reasonable restrictions.However, it clarified that this was not a licence to broadcast on social media platforms filthy words and depraved thoughts that militate against decency and morality. Expanding the scope of the petition of influencer Ranveer Allahbadia seeking protection from arrest for crass comments on a show, SC told the Centre to consider framing guidelines, after carrying out consultations with stakeholders, to regulate the content of shows and podcasts on social media.But these guidelines, whether framed judicially or by Parliament, should not be in the shape of censorship. Framers of our Constitution had the foresight of giving wide latitude to free speech and yet, at the same time, had exemplary wisdom to circumscribe it through reasonable restrictions enumerated in Article 19 (2). The guidelines should not lead to censorship. But to say it is a free for all is also very dangerous,” a bench of Justice Surya Kant and N K Singh said.The Supreme Court had on Feb 18 given Allahbadia a dressing down before staying his arrest in FIRs lodged in Thane and Guwahati.The court allowed Allahbadia to hold his shows on the condition that he would not violate traditional Indian norms on decency and morality.“There should be some element of control so that free speech is not misused but the regulations cannot impinge on freedom of speech,” the bench said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the govt was all for it.“Government is also against any censorship of free speech. But in the name of comedy, one cannot broadcast something which is indecent, vulgar and perverse. Freedom of speech is precious, it must be protected. But perversity cannot be freedom of speech. The young generation must be protected from such shows,” Mehta said.Allahbadia’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud pleaded with the court to stay the arrest and relax its Feb 18 condition — not to hold any show till further orders — and said 280 people worked with Allahbadia and their livelihood would be jeopardised if the petitioner was prevented from running his show.Taking into account the apology and remorse expressed by Allahbadia, the SC agreed to relax the condition but warned that he should not be seen violating traditional Indian societal norms on decency and morality in any of his shows. On his request to allow him to visit foreign countries, the bench said it would be considered after he cooperated with the investigations being carried out by police in Maharashtra and Assam.“We know one of your associates who went to Canada and made all kinds of comments on the court order,” the bench said, inviting an immediate clarification from Chandrachud that his client had nothing to do with the show broadcast from Canada. He said the person concerned was a copanelist with Allahbadia in the controversial show and there was no other connection between the two. “Such was the vulgarity, obscenity and the rotten level of humour and language used by Allahbadia in the show that no family could have sat together and watched that kind of a show,” the SG said.On the warning of ‘adults only’ for the show, Mehta said a child could not be allowed access to such shows under the specious ruse that the producers had sounded the ‘adults only’ warning. “Our standards of morality and decency differ from the western world,” he added.“Government also is against censorship, but there should be some regulation on such use of profanity which militates against the morality and decency of society. There are comedians who are very critical of the govt yet make shows without crossing the limits. They employ good humour, which can be watched by one and all,” Mehta said.The bench told Mehta that the Union govt should discuss with all stakeholders to deliberate what safeguards and measures are needed to regulate free speech, but these must not amount to censorship.","Ranveer allahbadia sought protection from arrest for crass comments on a show.

Govt panel chalks out 'glide path' for IAF's capability enhancement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-unveils-glide-path-to-expedite-capability-enhancement/articleshow/118691736.cms,"Defence minister Rajnath Singh with the report

NEW DELHI: A detailed roadmap for the “all-round accelerated capability enhancement” of the Indian Air Force has been chalked out by a high-powered committee to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner, with greater participation from the private sector to complement the ongoing efforts of the DRDO and defence PSUs.The “key thrust areas” identified in the report range from progressively increasing the number of fighter squadrons, which is currently down to just 30 despite a sanctioned strength of 42.5, to induction of additional “force-enablers” like airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft and mid-air refuelers as well as a wide array of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, who chaired the committee, presented the report to defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday evening, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh, vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar and others.It comes at a time when China is now flaunting even 6th-generation fighter prototypes, and is expected to deliver at least 40 J-35A stealth 5th-generation jets to Pakistan. India, in sharp contrast, is floundering to even produce the home-grown 4th-generation Tejas jet in adequate numbers, which has led the IAF chief to publicly lash out at Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) repeatedly. Noting that IAF is “very badly off in numbers”, ACM Singh on Friday said his force needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.“The committee has made recommendations for implementation of the key thrust areas in the short, medium and long-term so as to achieve the IAF’s desired capability enhancement goals in an optimal manner. The basic aim is to hasten the capability-building process in terms of R&D, production rates and the like,” an official said.Parallelly, a defence secretary-led committee has also been constituted to examine how the planned indigenous 5th-generation fighter called advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) can be fast-tracked.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the development of the swing-role AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore, but it will be ready for production only by 2035 as of now.The report presented on Monday has detailed a “glide path” to increasing the number of fighter squadrons, which includes a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer) tying up with an Indian partner to set up a production line here.“While HAL’s three production lines for the light-weight Tejas will continue, this will be a parallel production line for a different medium-weight fighter,” another official said. This involves the long-pending project to manufacture 114 new 4.5-generation fighters, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, with foreign collaboration.The report underscores “the need for impetus to enhance ‘Aatmanirbharta’ in the aerospace domain with the private sector complementing the effort of defence PSUs and DRDO”.“The defence minister directed that the recommendations be followed up in a time-bound manner. The committee was formed on his directions to holistically examine all issues and prepare a clear plan of action,” the official said.","A high-powered committee has chalked out a detailed roadmap for the “all-round accelerated capability enhancement’ of the indian air force.

JAMMU: Amid his perceived closeness with central government despite his party, National Conference, being part of opposition INDIA bloc, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday clarified there are no plans for an alliance with BJP as they had different political visions.“We both have different ideologies. Our thoughts also do not align... If we talk about J&K, our approach is vastly different,” Omar told reporters outside the assembly before the start of the budget session. The CM has repeatedly maintained that having cordial ties with the Centre should not be construed as political alignment with BJP.He also asserted that there was no need to bring a fresh resolution condemning the abrogation of Article 370, as the J&K Assembly had already passed one in its first sitting last year, and the Centre had not rejected it.Speaking in the assembly, Omar showered lavish praise on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , saying India and Pakistan were very close to resolving the Kashmir issue during his tenure. “I don’t think I will ever see it happening again in my lifetime,” he added.He said Singh carried forward the legacy of his predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee by keeping the dialogue process alive. “He could have stopped the process of dialogue, but continued shouldering it as a huge responsibility,” the CM said while speaking on obituary references in the House. Singh and former Pakistan president General Pervez Musharraf had made significant progress in talks, he said.Referring to the deteriorating situation in J&K in 2010, Omar said Singh set up working groups to heal the wounds of the people. A similar exercise was needed at present, too, he added.On Kashmiri Pandits, the CM said Manmohan Singh settled the community at the biggest Jagti Township colony in Jammu, and also reserved jobs for them. He also lauded Singh’s contributions to India’s economic growth and key welfare initiatives.Earlier, LG Manoj Sinha, in his address to the assembly, reaffirmed the Omar govt’s commitment to continue its efforts towards restoration of statehood.“One of the foremost aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is the restoration of full statehood. My govt remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing this legitimate desire of the citizens,” he said.Stating that the govt “recognises the emotional and political significance of statehood for the people”, he said it is actively engaging with all stakeholders to facilitate this process “in a manner that ensures peace, stability and progress”.“This budget carries historic significance as it is the first in over seven years to be presented by an elected govt in J&K,” Sinha further said, adding: “This budget is not merely a financial document; it is a testament to the aspirations of the masses, reflecting their hopes for a brighter future.”Unlike past years, when the budget address by the then governors of the erstwhile state of J&K were often disrupted by members, there was just a lone incident of walkout out by an Independent MLA, Sheikh Khursheed Ahmed, seeking justice for the families of two persons recently killed in Kathua and Sopore, and for restoration of statehood.","Omar abdullah says there are no plans for an alliance with bjp as they have different political visions.

And in that moment, he had belonged nowhere at all.Patel's passport bore Hussain's name and nationality, but American authorities saw through the deception. The man who claimed to be Hussain was unmasked.

Delhi police arrested him on arrival. He faces multiple serious charges, including cheating by impersonation, and misuse of passport. What stunned Indian immigration officials was the Pakistani passport. Not just any forged document, but an actual lost passport that belonged to Hussain.Cornered, Patel confessed. He had paid an agent in Dubai to forge his identity, swapping his Gujarat roots for a Pakistani character, just to secure a spot on a flight to US.Patel's real passport had expired in 2016 and instead of renewing it, he relied on human traffickers who provided him with fraudulent documents and facilitated his illegal journey via Dubai.""Human smugglers pick passports that are strong for getting a US visa or randomly assign some UAE citizen's passport to sneak into US,"" a source said.","Us has intensified crackdown on illegal immigrants following trump’s new term.

A fan wrote, “There was never any doubt Brett that you would weigh in with your stupid and ignorant take 😳”, while another fan wrote, “Maybe when you return the money that you scammed the government for, I might be willing to listen to your opinion.”A third fan wrote, “Brett Favre you took money from the poor to build your daughter a practice gym. You are despicable.”For the unversed, back in 2020, an audit in the state of Mississippi found that the Department of Human Services spent $1.1 million on Brett Favre’s company for two appearances that he did not make. Brett Favre was asked to repay $828,000 and by 2021, the former NFL player had only repaid $600,000.When the FBI questioned Brett Favre, his lawyer spoke about the NFL player having no knowledge that the money he received was for economically challenged families. Brett Favre was not charged with anything.Later in 2022, it was reported by Mississippi Today that there were texts between Brett Favre and Phil Bryant, former governor of Mississippi about diverting $5 million to building a volleyball facility where his daughter studied, the University of Southern Mississippi.Brett Favre has been trolled in the past too due to his political views. However, the former NFL player has found himself in many such controversies throughout his career.Currently, the former NFL player is dealing with a serious health issue that he disclosed in September 2024. Brett Favre has spoken about being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The disease started with his arm failing him.As per TMZ Sports, Brett Favre had spoken about onset of the disease and said, “I felt my arm, the strength was there, but I could not guide it,” he told TMZ Sports. “And it was the most frustrating thing.”Currently, Brett Favre has not updated his fans about the diagnosis after he intitally disclosed about the disease.Also Read: Taylor Swift feels “branded as the bad guy” in her relationship with Travis Kelce and fans wonder if their relationship is in trouble","Brett favre has been in the news due to his political views, but his recent post has caused an uproar on social media, and fans are having none of it.

Report indicates that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are dealing with some internal issues

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been having a consistent relationship after going public in September 2023. More than a year later, they seem to be doing well without a significant problem—at least for now. Nonetheless, a recent publication by RadarOnline indicates that they might be encountering a problem. Kelce has allegedly come under attack for not being completely dedicated to his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, because of his high-profile relationship with Swift.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have had a fairly drama-free and easy relationship since they made their romance public back in September 2023. Now, over a year into the relationship, they haven't encountered any major setbacks—at least, none that have been made public. But a new report from RadarOnline indicates that the couple are dealing with some internal issues.The report says that Kelce has been criticized for not being entirely committed to his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, as his celebrity relationship with Swift continues to draw enormous public interest. Some feel that his attention has been divided, which has raised doubts about his on-field performance.At the same time, Swift's inner circle is said to be starting to fear that the romance has been overplayed in the media, particularly after the Super Bowl backlash when a portion of the audience at New Orleans' Superdome booed her. These fears have apparently created a tension between the couple, as they deal with the intense scrutiny that comes with being famous.""Now, her team's advising her to lay low for a while, and it’s got to sting a bit, like a sense of guilt she hasn’t earned,"" RadarOnline's source revealed. ""This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road.”""Until now, it’s been nothing but good times! You can only imagine the awkward discussions happening behind the scenes about when it’s appropriate for them to be seen together and how they’re supposed to act. Definitely not the romantic vibe they were hoping for!”In spite of the alleged strain in their relationship, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce appear to be working hard to keep their love affair going. Rumor has it that the couple recently embarked on a private foreign trip, getting some quality time together out of the limelight. On returning to the United States, they were also seen on a dinner date, showing that they are still making their relationship a priority despite their hectic schedules and media attention.What is notable, though, is that no pictures of their weekend getaway or date night have emerged, which is rare considering the amount of media attention Swift and Kelce usually generate. This absence of photos has fueled rumors that they might be deliberately keeping a lower profile.Also Read: Travis Kelce's decision of playing his 13th season next year might affect his future with Taylor Swift Others feel this is in line with the notion that they have been told to take a step back from the spotlight for a bit, perhaps to de-escalate some of the scrutiny that has come with their very public relationship. Whether or not this move is a reaction to recent backlash or merely a desire to have more privacy, it seems Swift and Kelce are being cautious with their relationship in the face of continued public fascination.","Report indicates that taylor swift and travis kelce are dealing with some internal issues.

Trump BLOCKS Military Aid To Ukraine After Stunning Threat To Zelensky; Russia Celebrates Action

Watch in full as Zelensky and Trump clash in fiery Oval Office exchange | BBC News

President Donald Trump ordered a ""pause"" on US military aid to Ukraine on Monday following a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy toward peace talks with Russia.The White House has announced a review and temporary pause on aid to ensure it supports a peaceful resolution. ""The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,"" a White House official said anonymously.The official said that all US military equipment not yet in Ukraine would be halted, including weapons en route by air or sea and those held in transit areas in Poland.

He also suggested that leaders unwilling to negotiate peace ""won't be around very long"" or ""won't be listened to for long.""Just hours before Trump announced a halt to Ukraine aid , Zelenskyy expressed optimism about continued support from Western nations and the United States.In a post on X, Zelenskyy pointed out the urgency of diplomatic efforts to end the war swiftly. ""We are working together with America and our European partners and very much hope on US support on the path to peace.

In a late-night operation on Monday-Tuesday, police conducted raids at the residences of several farmer leaders ahead of the March 5 protest in Chandigarh.

While some leaders managed to evade arrest, others were taken into custody during the crackdown.

The raids followed the breakdown of negotiations between the Punjab government and Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders on Monday evening.

Leaders, including Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Sarwan Singh Pandher, criticized the police action, calling it undemocratic and an attempt to suppress the right to protest.

US Senate blocks GOP-led bill to ban trans athletes from competing in women’s sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senate-blocks-gop-led-bill-to-ban-trans-athletes-from-competing-in-womens-sports/articleshow/118695140.cms,"President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to ban transgender athletes from women's sports(AP)

Democrats on Monday blocked a Republican-written bill, aimed at preventing transgender women and girls from competing in female school athletics nationwide. The measure, which Republicans had emphasised during previous elections, fell short of the required 60 votes, resulting in a 51-45 party-line division.The legislation attempted to establish Title IX protections based on biological characteristics at birth. Republicans have consistently focused on this matter, presenting it as a question of athletic fairness for women and girls, AP news agency reported.Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order granting federal agencies discretion to ensure Title IX compliance by federal funding recipients, based on birth-assigned gender. Congressional Republicans sought to codify this interpretation by modifying the 1972 Title IX law, which safeguards against sex-based discrimination in federally-assisted education programmes.Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated, ""Around the country we have seen men - biological men who identify as women - take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women. This is a matter of fairness and equality.""""Democrats can stand for women or stand with a radical transgender ideology,"" he added. If they opposed the legislation, he said, ""they'll have to answer to the women and girls they vote to disenfranchise.""Despite passing in the House with minimal Democratic support, the Senate outcome highlighted challenges facing LGBTQ-focused legislation. Democrats criticised the bill as diverting attention from crucial issues and overstepping into local education decisions.Senator Brian Schatz declared, ""What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other.""Senator Tammy Baldwin noted, ""This is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.""Republicans maintain their focus on this issue, with Trump's campaign finding broader appeal beyond party boundaries.In Minnesota, the state House prepared for similar discussions on GOP legislation affecting primary and secondary schools. Supporters gathered at St Paul's Capitol steps, advocating for girls' sports opportunities and fair competition.","The legislation attempted to establish title ix protections based on biological characteristics at birth.

Taiwan to review investment



Tariff pressures and manufacturing push



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will invest at least $100 billion in the United States to expand its semiconductor production , President Donald Trump announced Monday. The investment will go toward building five advanced fabrication facilities, adding to the company’s existing commitments in the US.Speaking at a White House event alongside TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei, Trump hailed the announcement as another major financial pledge by a private company since his return to office. “We are going to produce many chips to support AI progress, and to support smartphones’ progress,” Wei said.Much of the funding is expected to go into Arizona, where TSMC has already invested significantly. The company previously committed over $65 billion during former President Joe Biden’s administration, with one Arizona factory starting production in late 2024. The new expansion will include three additional fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities, and a research and development centre, creating around 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years, according to a company statement.Taiwanese officials said Tuesday they would review TSMC’s investment in the US to ensure it aligns with the country’s semiconductor industry interests.“The review will be conducted in accordance with the law,” cabinet spokeswoman Michelle Lee said, adding that authorities would consider the company’s growth while safeguarding the sector’s overall competitiveness.Lee also highlighted the strategic importance of Taiwan’s partnership with the US in high-tech industries. “The close cooperation in high-tech industries between Taiwan and the United States has made Taiwan the most important partner for the United States in maintaining its leading position in high-tech and technology industries,” she stated.However, concerns persist that shifting too much production abroad could weaken Taiwan’s so-called ""Silicon Shield""—a reference to the country’s dominance in chipmaking, which is seen as a key geopolitical asset amid tensions with China.Trump has been pushing companies to ramp up manufacturing within the US, warning of tariffs on those that do not comply. He has floated a 25 percent tariff on all semiconductor chips made outside the country. His administration has already imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods and is set to introduce a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday.“There’s no room left for Mexico or for Canada,” Trump said Monday. “They’re all set, they go into effect tomorrow.”Since taking office on January 20, Trump has touted over $1 trillion in investment commitments from major corporations. Apple alone has pledged $500 billion over the next four years. However, critics note that some ambitious economic promises from Trump’s first term failed to materialize.","Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co (tsmc) will invest at least $100 billion in the united states to expand its semiconductor production.
