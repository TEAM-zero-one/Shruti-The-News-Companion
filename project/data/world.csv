"After PM’s tribute to Somnath temple, BJP blames Nehru for distorting history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-pms-tribute-to-somnath-temple-bjp-blames-nehru-for-distorting-history/articleshow/126363852.cms,"NEW DELHI : After PM Narendra Modi penned a tribute to Somnath temple and described it as a symbol of India’s civilisational resilience and its indomitable spirit, BJP said Monday its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni 1,000 years back was driven by religious fanaticism and blamed Jawaharlal Nehru and “leftist” historians of portraying the Muslim invader as a mere plunderer.At a presser, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi framed US President Donald Trump’s claim post-Op Sindoor that India and Pakistan had been fighting for 1,000 years against the backdrop of Ghazni’s plundering expeditions to India.“Trump had also said that the conflict between India and Pakistan is 1,000 years old and that Kashmir is linked to that. It’s indeed a 1,000-yearold fight. Pakistan’s missiles are named after Ghazni, Babar and Ghori,” he said.Modi will join the “Somnath Swabhiman Parv” on Jan 11 to celebrate the resilience of the Indian civilisation, lauding its spirit that led to its rebuilding, last time after independence, after being vandalised and looted repeatedly by invaders.Spiritual figures praised Modi for spreading awareness about the Shiva temple, one of the 12 jyotirlingas dedicated to the god, and the programme. It is a centre of the country’s faith, preacher Morari Bapu said, adding joining the endeavour is essential to ensure that the temple does not suffer any attack in future.Swami Avdheshanand of Juna Akhara praised the write-up, saying the temple stands as an ode to Indian civilisation.Attacking past historians, Trivedi said Nehru’s book ‘Discovery of India’ was a source of historical distortions. Nehru had described Mahmoud of Ghazni as far more a warrior than a man of faith who exploited the name of religion for his conquest to earn treasures and materials, He cited work of a historian to claim the invader was very much motivated by religious fanaticism in his destruction of the temple as he wanted to be known as a “but-shikan” (idol-breaker).","Pm narendra modi penned a tribute to somnath temple and described it as a symbol of india’s civilisational resilience. Bjp said monday its destruction by mahmud of ghazni 1,000 years back was driven by religious fanaticism.

NEW DELHI: Amid a tightening security environment shaped by a militarily assertive China and a volatile Pakistan, the defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly Rs 79,000 crore, marking one of the most consequential procurement approvals in recent years. The clearances were accorded by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh , which approved a wide range of systems spanning air defence missiles, combat drones, long-range rockets, air-to-air weapons, aerial refuellers and counter-drone technologies.Senior military officials have repeatedly stressed that future conflicts will be defined by speed, precision and the ability to fight across domains. “Timely induction of critical capabilities is essential to maintain operational readiness in a rapidly evolving threat environment,” the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, said recently, underscoring the urgency behind such decisions. While Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) is only the first step in the procurement process, it formally establishes the armed forces’ requirements and allows detailed tenders, trials and negotiations to begin.Taken together, the latest approvals offer a revealing snapshot of how India’s armed forces are recalibrating for wars that may unfold under the shadow of drone swarms, long-range missiles, electronic warfare and sustained precision strikes. Many of the systems cleared have been shaped by operational lessons from recent crises, assessed against the growing missile and air power capabilities of China and Pakistan, and aligned with a more pragmatic “Make in India with partners” approach rather than doctrinaire import substitution. What follows is not merely a list of acquisitions, but an emerging blueprint for how India plans to deter, and if necessary fight, high-intensity conflicts across its borders in the coming decade.The single largest approval under the latest DAC meeting is the Rs 30,000 crore procurement of a large number of Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missiles for the Indian Air Force and Navy. Jointly developed by India and Israel, Barak-8 has become the backbone of India’s medium-tier air defence architecture.With an interception range of over 70 km, Barak-8 is designed to neutralise a wide spectrum of aerial threats, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Its advanced active radar seeker and ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously make it critical in countering saturation attacks.The missile system proved its operational value during the cross-border hostilities in May, when Pakistan launched multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles. Barak-8 was part of India’s multi-layered air defence network that successfully intercepted incoming threats, preventing damage to key military installations.For the Navy, Barak-8 is deployed aboard frontline destroyers, frigates and aircraft carriers, providing area air defence against anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft. For the IAF, ground-based Barak-8 squadrons protect air bases and strategic assets. The new procurement aims to significantly bolster missile stocks, addressing concerns over wartime depletion and sustained engagements.The DAC also approved the Rs 1,600-crore lease of two additional MQ-9B Predator drones for a period of three years. These high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles will supplement the two Predators currently operated by the Navy.MQ-9Bs are capable of flying for over 30 hours at altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet, providing persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance across vast areas. They are particularly valuable for maritime domain awareness in the Indian Ocean Region, tracking hostile naval movements and monitoring choke points.The leased drones are meant to bridge a critical capability gap until India receives 31 armed MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft systems under the $3.8 billion deal signed with the US in October last year. Deliveries under that deal are expected only in 2029–30.By opting for a lease rather than outright purchase, the military avoids a capability vacuum during a period of heightened regional tensions, particularly in the Indo-Pacific and along the Line of Actual Control with China.Another major clearance is the long-pending acquisition of six mid-air refuelling aircraft for the Indian Air Force at a cost exceeding Rs 9,000 crore. The lack of adequate aerial refuellers has long constrained the IAF’s ability to sustain long-range air operations.Under the approved plan, Israel Aerospace Industries will convert six second-hand Boeing 767 commercial aircraft into aerial tankers. The conversion involves structural reinforcement, installation of refuelling booms, fuel tanks and mission systems.A fresh AoN was required because the tender resulted in a single-vendor situation. Despite that, the urgency of the requirement has pushed the government to move ahead.Mid-air refuellers dramatically extend the operational reach and endurance of fighter jets, transport aircraft and surveillance platforms. They are especially critical for deep-penetration strikes, rapid force mobilisation, and sustained air patrols over contested areas. With China operating a growing fleet of refuellers and Pakistan steadily upgrading its air force, the IAF’s refuelling gap had become increasingly stark.Two crucial indigenous missile projects cleared by the DAC focus on extending India’s air-to-air combat envelope. The first is the Astra Mark-2 air-to-air missile, whose range is being enhanced from the current 100 km to around 200 km.Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Astra is India’s first indigenous beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. It is already integrated with Su-30MKI fighters and is slated for deployment on Tejas and other platforms.The IAF is expected to place an initial order for 600–700 Astra Mk-2 missiles. In parallel, work is underway on Astra Mark-3, which will have an estimated range of around 350 km, placing it firmly in the long-range interception category.Indigenous long-range air-to-air missiles are increasingly important as aerial combat shifts from close dogfights to stand-off engagements, where detection, tracking and first-shot capability determine outcomes.The DAC’s nod for extending the range of Pinaka guided rocket ammunition marks a major leap in India’s artillery firepower. Pinaka multiple launch rocket systems currently fire rockets up to a range of 75 km, already giving them an edge over older systems.The new guided variants aim to extend that range to 120 km, with future plans to reach up to 300 km. According to officials, the 120-km version was successfully tested on Sunday, demonstrating improved accuracy and lethality.A 300-km Pinaka would fundamentally alter battlefield dynamics, allowing the Army to strike deep into enemy territory without relying on air power. Such capability is particularly relevant along mountainous borders, where terrain and weather often limit air operations.Pinaka’s modular design and compatibility with different warheads make it a versatile system for counter-battery fire, suppression of enemy air defences and destruction of logistics hubs.While indigenous systems form the core of the modernisation drive, the DAC also approved additional procurements of select foreign munitions to plug immediate gaps. This includes more Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles for Rafale fighters.With a range of 120–150 km, Meteor is considered one of the most lethal air-to-air missiles in service today, featuring a ramjet propulsion system that maintains high energy throughout its flight.The council also cleared the acquisition of Israeli guidance kits for SPICE-1000 precision-guided bombs. These kits transform conventional bombs into long-range, highly accurate weapons capable of striking targets from up to 125 km away.Together, these munitions significantly enhance the Rafale’s stand-off strike and air dominance capabilities, allowing it to engage high-value targets without entering heavily defended airspace.Among the most telling approvals is the procurement of 850 kamikaze drones, or loitering munitions, for the Army’s new ‘Shaktibaan’ and ‘Divyastra’ artillery batteries at a cost of around Rs 2,000 crore.Loitering munitions combine surveillance and strike capabilities in a single platform. They can hover over a target area, identify enemy assets and then dive onto the target with an explosive payload.The drones approved under this programme will be manufactured in India, either by domestic firms or through foreign collaboration. Their induction reflects lessons drawn from conflicts such as Ukraine, where loitering munitions have been used extensively for precision strikes against armour, artillery and air defence systems.For the Indian Army, these drones provide a flexible, cost-effective tool for real-time battlefield engagement without risking pilots or high-value aircraft.The DAC also cleared the indigenous Integrated Drone Detection and Interdiction System Mark-2. Equipped with 30-kilowatt lasers, the system can disable, degrade or destroy small remotely piloted aircraft and swarm drones at ranges of up to 3.5 km.Drone swarms are increasingly viewed as a major threat, capable of overwhelming traditional air defence systems through sheer numbers. Laser-based systems offer a relatively low-cost, rapid-response solution to such threats.The IDD&IS integrates detection, tracking and neutralisation into a single platform, making it suitable for protecting air bases, ammunition depots and critical infrastructure. Its approval signals a recognition that future conflicts will involve contested airspace even at very low altitudes.Beyond new acquisitions, the DAC approved overhauls of Mi-17 helicopters in Russia and T-90S main battle tanks in India. These overhauls aim to extend the service life and operational readiness of existing platforms.Mi-17 helicopters form the backbone of the IAF’s medium-lift fleet, supporting transport, casualty evacuation and special operations. T-90 tanks remain central to the Army’s armoured formations, particularly along the western front.Sustaining these platforms is critical even as newer systems are inducted, ensuring there are no capability gaps during the transition phase.Several smaller but vital projects were also cleared. These include low-level lightweight radars for detecting aerial threats, bollard-pull naval tugs for harbour operations, full mission simulators for Tejas fighter jets, and automatic take-off and landing recording systems for the IAF.The DAC also approved the acquisition of high-frequency software-defined radios to enable secure long-range communications across services. Such systems are essential for network-centric warfare, allowing forces to share data in real time.While less visible than missiles or drones, these enablers are critical for operational effectiveness, training and safety.Taken together, the Rs 79,000 crore modernisation push offers a clear snapshot of how India expects future wars to be fought. The focus is on layered air defence, long-range precision strikes, persistent surveillance, unmanned systems and electronic resilience.Rather than betting on a single platform or technology, the approvals reflect a systems-based approach, integrating missiles, drones, aircraft and sensors into a cohesive combat network. The blend of indigenous development and selective imports suggests a more mature procurement philosophy, driven by operational need rather than ideology.","The defence ministry has cleared military modernisation projects worth nearly rs 79,000 crore. The clearances were accorded by the defence acquisition council (dac) it approved a wide range of systems spanning air defence missiles, combat drones, long-range rockets, air-to-air weapons and aerial refuellers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126351431,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-109180,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

ji

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday likened US President Donald Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini over the United States’ actions in Venezuela. He also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly yielding to Trump’s demand to cut India’s purchase of oil from Russia, which has been at war with Ukraine since February 2022.“What is happening in Venezuela today is not good for the world. Trump is trying to frighten people across the globe,” Kharge told reporters in Delhi, referring to the US military action in Venezuela that led to the ouster of Maduro. The Venezuelan leader and his wife were then takento New York to face multiple charges, primarily related to narco-terrorism.Alleging that the US president was indulging in “expansionism,” the Congress chief said that leaders who attempt to expand their territories, like Hitler and Mussolini, “do not remain in power for long.”Kharge further referred to Trump's repeated claim about ending the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict, saying that he has repeated his claim around 70 times.""What does it mean? That he (Trump) is a tall personality and he can make the world bow to him. But the world won't bow before him. We live in a democracy, only through a democratic method we have to go ahead...Nehru's policy was 'live and let live'. That is our policy,"" he added.Reacting to Trump’s recent statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi knows he (Trump) is unhappy with India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, Kharge invoked a dialogue from the 1989 Hindi film ""Mr. India.""“It shows that PM Modi is under Trump’s control. I am reminded of a dialogue from Mr. India — ‘Mogambo khush hua’ (Mogambo is happy). If people with such a mindset try to scare the world, India is not going to cower. But I do not understand why Modi ji is bending before him. This is harmful for the nation. Stand for the country. You nod to whatever he says. The country did not elect you just to nod,” the veteran politician remarked.The US has imposed 50% tariffs on India, with the second 25% tranche linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. Washington has accused India of “funding Putin’s war machine” in Ukraine.The Republican leader has also repeatedly claimed that he used trade leverage to push India and Pakistan into a ceasefire agreement. However, New Delhi has consistently maintained that the ceasefire talks were a bilateral matter and were held following a request from Islamabad.",Congress president mallikarjun kharge likened us president donald trump to dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini.

BJP Welcomes SC Denial Of Bail To Umar Khalid And Sharjeel Imam; Opposition Calls It Unfortunate

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Monday came out in support of New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani for writing a letter to 2020 Delhi riots co-accused Umar Khalid.Chavan said that, as a person of Indian origin, Mamdani had “every right to intervene.”“He (Mamdani) has faith in Indian politics. He spoke in Hindi during his campaign, appealing to Indians there. Indian blood flows in him, so if injustice is happening to an Indian, he has every right to intervene, whether he is an American citizen or not. But more importantly, human rights are supreme. So I think there’s no need to panic if he wrote a letter,” Chavan told news agency PTI.The socialist Democrat, New York City’s first Muslim and Indian-origin mayor, is the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic Mahmood Mamdani. The 34-year-old was sworn in on New Year’s Day after winning the mayoral election in November last year.In his handwritten note to Khalid, who has been in jail since his arrest in September 2020, months after communal riots rocked the national capital in February that year, Mamdani wrote: “Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents.We are all thinking of you.”The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of two Delhi riots accused—Khalid and Sharjeel Imam—and granted bail, subject to conditions, to five others. They had challenged the Delhi high court’s rejection of their pleas.Meanwhile, Chavan’s remarks come days after he drew flak for claiming that India was “defeated” on the first day of its four-day conflict with Pakistan in May 2025. He later refused to apologise despite widespread outrage.In July last year, he had also sparked controversy by questioning why anti-terror operations were being given ""Hindu names.""","Prithviraj chavan supports new york city mayor zohran mamdani's letter to umar khalid.

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

NASIRABAD: At a time when the Centre is pushing for restructuring the defence forces, the Indian Army has carried out one of the biggest ever transformations to meet modern warfare challenges creating a pool of over one lakh drone operatives across the force.Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare, as all operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.Team visited one of the newly raised Bhairav battalions in the desert sector under the Southern Command, where it witnessed the capabilities of the troops who had been selected from Infantry regiments to raise the Special Force and were being given special training as per the requirements of modern warfare.The Bhairav battalions raised by Army Headquarters with lessons from global and own conflicts in mind, have been created to provide a dedicated force for high-speed, offensive operations to carry out the Special Forces tasking at multiple levels as per requirements.The Indian Army has raised around 15 of these battalions already, and they have been assigned to different formations on both borders and have plans to raise around 25 of them in total in the near future.The Bhairav battalions would also bridge the gap between the Para Special Forces and the regular Infantry battalions. The Bhairav would also be tasked to carry out Special Operations at tactical to operational depth.""Modern warfare is changing at a very rapid pace. The conflicts of today are hybrid in nature, and one needs to be fully equipped with modern technology to be able to deal with the Challenges. The Bhairav battalions have also been created as part of the force restructuring, which have been raised in line with the requirements of modern technology, new thought process and as per the new operational requirements,"" Commanding Officer of the 2 Bhairav Battalion told ANI in an exclusive interview.""I am the Commanding officer of the desert Bhairav battalion of the Southern Command of the Indian Army. The desert has its own challenges where special skill sets, endurance and technology are required to be used in the right way. That is why the Bhairav has been raised as a technology-driven system which can operate independently and carry out multi-domain operations in the future,"" he added.Explaining about the formation of the unit, the Commanding officer said, ""The desert Bhairav Battalion has been raised on the concept of 'Sons of the Soil' as the majority of the troops are from Rajasthan who can understand the terrain, language, weather and the area. The battalion has been built upon the legacy of the valour and gallantry of Rajanghan, and that is our biggest strength. We are ready to meet any challenge in the desert sector. ""The Bhairav battalions have trained very hard in the last five months since their raising, using modern technology and carried out successful operational validation during the Exercise Akhand Prahar, where the troops showcased their readiness in the presence of Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Dhiraj Seth.The Commanding Officer said the force was evolving very strongly and emerging as the ""Swift, Capable and Decisive"" force of the Southern Command and the Indian Army. The Bhairav battalions would also be part of the India Army's Army Day Parade at Jaipur to be held on January 15 this year. The 2 Bhairav, also known as the Desert Falcons, would be taking part in the event.The Indian Army has also carried out major force restructuring keeping in mind the operational requirements and created Rudra Brigades, which are all-arms formations that combine infantry, mechanised units, tanks, artillery, special forces, and unmanned aerial systems with dedicated logistics and combat support.The Artillery, Mechanised Infantry and the Armoured Corps are also being equipped with modern warfare equipment like drones and other capabilities to be able to perform tasks more efficiently.","Bhairav, the latest special force raised by the indian army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare. All operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126331776,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-477475,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Akal Takht summons Mann over 'anti-Sikh remarks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/akal-takht-summons-mann-over-anti-sikh-remarks/articleshow/126360816.cms,"AMRITSAR: The officiating Jathedar of Akal Takht, Giani Kuldip Singh Gargajj, has summoned Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann to appear at its secretariat on Jan 15 over alleged ""anti-Sikh remarks"", ""objectionable conduct"", and a recently surfaced video that the Takht says deeply hurt Sikh sentiments.Mann posted on X that he would appear before Sri Akal Takht Sahib as a ""humble and devout Sikh instead of a chief minister"". ""Any command from Sri Akal Takht Sahib Ji is accepted with full reverence and will be obeyed. I will walk barefoot before Sri Akal Takht Sahib,"" he said.Mann said though the President is visiting Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar on Jan 15, he would still obey the Takht summons. ""For me, Sri Akal Takht Sahib Ji is above everything. The command received from the sacred Takht is, was, and will always be supreme to me and my family,"" he said. Jathedar Gargajj said the CM, despite holding a high constitutional office, repeatedly made statements that challenged ""Sikh Rehat Maryada (code of religious conduct)"", supremacy of Akal Takht, and sanctity of Guru Ki Golak. ""These comments reflect an arrogance of power and an anti-Sikh mindset,"" Gargajj alleged.Clarifying why the CM was not summoned to appear at the facade (Fasil) of Akal Takht, the jathedar said that Bhagwant Mann is a ""patit (apostate)"" and, according to Sikh tradition, cannot be summoned to appear at Fasil. ""Therefore, he was summoned to personally appear at the secretariat of Akal Takht at 10am on Jan 15 to submit his explanation,"" Gargajj said.Jathedar Gargajj said a controversial video that had recently surfaced would be subjected to forensic examination and, if found authentic, strict Panthic action would follow.Mann got support from rather unexpected quarters. BJP criticised the Akal Takht summons, with party Punjab spokesperson Sarchand Singh calling it a ""well-orchestrated exercise"" to shield senior Shiromani Akali Dal leaders and those who are facing arrest over the 328 missing sacred saroops of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Invoking ""religious defiance"" was a tactic to exert pressure on the CM and obstruct the SIT investigation, he said. He said there is no Panthic tradition of summoning a 'patit' Sikh even at the Akal Takht secretariat.","Jathedar of akal takht summons punjab cm bhagwant mann to appear at its secretariat on jan 15 over alleged ""anti-sikh remarks"", ""objectionable conduct"", and a recently surfaced video that the takht says deeply hurt sikh sentiments.

Senior policymakers, academic leaders and industry experts on Monday flagged lifelong learning, human augmentation and inclusive skilling as central to India’s AI journey at a high-level Human Capital Working Group meeting hosted at IIT Guwahati.The two-day meeting (January 5–6), jointly organised by the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), the IndiaAI Mission, the Assam government and IIT Guwahati, is expected to shape policy inputs for the India AI Impact Summit 2026 scheduled in New Delhi next month. Chaired by Prof T G Sitharam, the deliberations focused on education reform, workforce transition and responsible, human-centric AI adoption as India prepares for large-scale economic and social disruption.Speakers across government and academia cautioned against narrow, fragmented skilling models and called for a shift towards lifelong learning ecosystems. “The transition to an AI-enabled economy must be inclusive and people-centric,” Sitharam said, stressing that technological progress must translate into dignity, opportunity and resilience for workers.IndiaAI joint director Shikha Dahiya said outcomes from the Guwahati deliberations would directly inform global-level discussions at the summit, with a focus on democratising AI resources, building indigenous models and amplifying Global South perspectives.Assam officials highlighted the risks of unchecked automation, urging policymakers to prioritise human augmentation over replacement and expand AI literacy as a public capability.Day one featured a keynote on democratising competency in the age of AI and panel discussions on gender-responsive AI strategies and redefining education for the cognitive age, flagging risks of widening inequality if policy responses lag technological change.The meeting will conclude on Monday with consolidated recommendations expected to feed into India’s national AI human capital roadmap aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047.","India's artificial intelligence strategy is decisively shifting towards people-first reform.

‘Mouths shut when Hindus are killed’: Yogi targets opposition in Assembly

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, during a press conference held in Amravati.He referred to recent reports that claimed people's identities were being determined through mobile phones. Owaisi said that the UP government should be ""congratulated"" for the new ""invention"" to determine whether a person is Bangladeshi by placing a mobile phone on their back.Owaisi sarcastically said that even leading scientists and ISRO would be surprised by this ""technology.""He questioned whether citizenship and identity in India would now be determined by mobile phones. He said that such actions were not only ridiculous but also against both the law and the Constitution.Furthermore, Owaisi claimed that after a mosque, the administration has now taken bulldozer action against madrasas, which are being termed illegal, in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district. He alleged that the government is acting arbitrarily in the name of bulldozer action and misusing the law.He alleged that the government is targeting a particular community and using the bulldozer as a political weapon.However, the administration says that the action is being taken only against illegal constructions and there is no discrimination against any community.The AIMIM chief alleged that such manoeuvres are creating an atmosphere of fear among the public and arbitrariness in the name of law and order. He demanded that the government adhere to constitutional and legal procedures on serious issues like identity and citizenship.He levelled serious allegations against the Modi government and the ruling parties regarding electoral politics. He stated that first, there was the issue of vote theft, and now candidates are being ""stolen.""He alleged that in many places, candidates are being forced to withdraw their nominations through intimidation, threats, or bribery, which is a very dangerous trend for democracy.Owaisi said that if voters are not provided with a candidate of their choice, the very foundation of democracy will be weakened. He also said that this process directly violates the public's right to vote, reducing elections to a mere formality.On the BMC elections, Owaisi said, ""If elections are being held unopposed anywhere through intimidation, threats, or bribery, then it is a threat to our democracy.""Owaisi appealed to political parties to keep constitutional obligations and social harmony in mind when making statements on issues like elections and population.Owaisi raised several serious questions about the central government's foreign policy and security strategy. He said that after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India took a tough stance and tightened its water-related agreements against Pakistan, but despite this, there was no hesitation in playing against Pakistan in international cricket tournaments.Calling this a ""double standard,"" Owaisi asked why normal relations are being pursued on the playing field while issuing strong statements on terrorism.Speaking on the Bangladesh issue, Owaisi said that a clear and transparent policy should be formulated regarding illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India. Those living illegally should be deported through legal procedures, but the entire process should be in accordance with the Constitution and human values. He said that political stability in Bangladesh is crucial for the security and development of India, especially the northeastern states.Owaisi also said that increased strategic activities by China near the Bangladesh border and the presence of elements linked to Pakistan's intelligence agency are matters of concern. He stressed that these issues should be viewed not merely from a political perspective but in the broader context of national security.",All india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (aimim) national president asaduddin owaisi on has criticised the yogi adityanath government in uttar pradesh.

‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

(Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India and is also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust)

Somnath… hearing this word instils a sense of pride in our hearts and minds. It is the eternal proclamation of India’s soul. This majestic temple is situated on the western coast of India in Gujarat, at a place called Prabhas Patan. The Dwadasha Jyotirling Stotram mentions the 12 Jyotirlings across India.The stotram begins with “Saurashtre Somnatham Ch”, symbolising the civilisational and spiritual importance of Somnath as the first Jyotirling.It is also said: Somalingam Naro Drishtva Sarvapapaih PramuchyateLabhte Phalam Manovaanchitam Mritah Svargam SamaashrayetIt means: Just the sight of Somnath Shivling ensures that a person is freed of sins, achieves their righteous desires and attains heaven after death.Tragically, this very Somnath, which drew the reverence and prayers of millions, was attacked by foreign invaders, whose agenda was demolition, not devotion.The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple . It has been 1,000 years since the first attack on this great shrine. It was in Jan of 1026 that Mahmud of Ghazni attacked this temple, seeking to destroy a great symbol of faith and civilisation, through a violent and barbaric invasion.Yet, one thousand years later, the temple stands as glorious as ever because of numerous efforts to restore Somnath to its grandeur. One such milestone completes 75 years in 2026. It was during a ceremony on May 11th, 1951, in the presence of the then President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad , that the restored temple opened its doors to devotees.The first invasion of Somnath a thousand years ago in 1026, the cruelty that was unleashed upon the people of the town and the devastation that was inflicted upon the shrine have been documented in great detail in various historical accounts.When you read them, the heart trembles. Each line carries the weight of grief, cruelty and a sorrow that refuses to fade with time.Imagine the impact it had on Bharat and the morale of the people. After all, Somnath had great spiritual significance. It was also on the coast, giving strength to a society with great economic prowess, whose sea traders and seafarers carried tales of its grandeur far and wide.Yet, I am proud to state unequivocally that the story of Somnath, a thousand years after the first attack, is not defined by destruction. It is defined by the unbreakable courage of crores of children of Bharat Mata.The medieval barbarism that began a thousand years ago in 1026 went on to ‘inspire’ others to repeatedly attack Somnath. It was the start of an attempt to enslave our people and culture. But, each time the temple was attacked, we also had great men and women who stood up to defend it and even made the ultimate sacrifice. And every single time, generation after generation, the people of our great civilisation picked themselves up, rebuilt and rejuvenated the temple. It is our privilege to have been nurtured by the same soil that has nurtured greats like Ahilyabai Holkar, who made a noble attempt to ensure devotees can pray at Somnath.In the 1890s, Swami Vivekananda visited Somnath and that experience moved him. He expressed his feelings during a lecture in Chennai in 1897 when he said, “Some of these old temples of southern India and those like Somnath of Gujarat will teach you volumes of wisdom, will give you a keener insight into the history of the race than any amount of books. Mark how these temples bear the marks of a hundred attacks and a hundred regenerations, continually destroyed and continually springing up out of the ruins, rejuvenated and strong as ever! That is the nationalmind, that is the national lifecurrent. Follow it and it leads to glory. Give it up and you die; death will be the only result, annihilation, the only effect, the moment you step beyond that life current.”The sacred duty of rebuilding the Somnath Temple after Independence came to the able hands of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. A visit during Diwali time in 1947 moved him so much that he announced that the temple will be rebuilt there. Finally, on May 11th, 1951, a grand temple in Somnath opened its doors to devotees and Dr Rajendra Prasad was present there. The great Sardar Sahib was not alive to see this historic day, but the fulfilment of his dream stood tall before the nation.The then Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was not too enthused with this development. He did not want the honourable President as well as ministers to associate with this special event. He said that this event created a bad impression of India. But Dr Rajendra Prasad stood firm and the rest is history. No mention of Somnath is complete without recalling the efforts of KM Munshi, who supported Sardar Patel very effectively. His works on Somnath, including the book, ‘Somanatha: The Shrine Eternal’, are extremely informative and educative.Indeed, as the title of Munshi Ji’s book conveys, we are a civilisation that carries a sense of conviction about the eternity of spirit and of ideas. We firmly believe that that which is eternal is indestructible, as outlined in the famous Gita verse “ Nainam Chhindanti Shastraani ...”. There can be no better example of our civilisation’s indomitable spirit than Somnath, which stands gloriously, overcoming odds and struggles.It is this same spirit that is visible in our nation, one of the brightest spots of global growth, having overcome centuries of invasions and colonial loot. It is our value systems and the determination of our people that have made India the centre of global attention today. The world is seeing India with hope and optimism.They want to invest in our innovative youngsters. Ourart, culture, music and several festivals are going global. Yoga and Ayurveda are making a worldwide impact, boosting healthy living. Solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges are coming from India.Since time immemorial, Somnath has brought together people from different walks of life. Centuries ago, Kalikal Sarvagna Hemchandracharya, a respected Jain monk, came to Somnath. It is said that after praying there, he recited a verse, “ Bhavabijaankurjananaaraagaadyaah Kshayamupagataa Yasya” . It means: Salutations to That One in whom the seeds of worldly becoming are destroyed, in whom passion and all afflictions have withered away. Today, Somnath holds the same ability to awaken something profound within the mind and soul.A thousand years after the first attack in 1026, the sea at Somnath still roars with the same intensity as it did back then. The waves that wash the shores of Somnath tell a story. No matter what, just like the waves, it kept rising again and again. The aggressors of the past are now dust in the wind, their names synonymous with destruction. They are footnotes in the annals of history, while Somnath stands bright, radiating far beyond the horizon, reminding us of the eternal spirit that remained undiminished by the attack of 1026. Somnath is a song of hope that tells us that while hate and fanaticism may have the power to destroy for a moment, faith and conviction in the power of goodness have the power to create for eternity.If the Somnath Temple, which was attacked a thousand years ago and faced continuous attacks thereon, could rise again and again, then we can surely restore our great nation to the glory it embodied a thousand years ago before the invasions. With the blessings of Shree Somnath Mahadev, we move forward with a renewed resolve to build a Viksit Bharat, where civilisational wisdom guides us to work for the welfare of the whole world.Jai Somnath!","The year 2026 is significant for the somnath temple.

Mahmoud Charr challenged Tyson Fury to prove that he is the heavyweight jungle king, as he confronted him while walking a LION. Charr, who once survived an assassination attempt, has been Fury's social media nemesis for years and created his most ridiculous video yet.""Tyson Fury, the Arab king, has arrived."" Charr declared while walking a Lion on the leash. Take the challenge. I’m coming to the UK. “I’m ready to punch your face, man. Don’t talk too much, sign the paper. You promised the people.”After retiring in January of last year due to back-to-back defeats by 38-year-old Oleksandr Usyk, Fury, 37, declared he would make a comeback to the ring this year. The two-time heavyweight world champion from Britain is training for his recent comeback.Kubrat Pulev, 44, defeated Mahmoud Charr, 41, in his last fight in December 2024. The Lebanese-born heavyweight is fortunate to be alive after being the target of a drive-by shooting in a kebab shop in Essen, Western Germany. After enduring two hip surgeries, he amazingly survived and lived to witness Youssef Hassan, his shooter, receive a five-year prison sentence. Charr was remarkably back in the ring after just nine months, capping an incredible return.Mahmoud Charr survives gunshots, claims he’s ready to fight Tyson FuryMahmoud Charr nearly lost his life 32 fights into his career, after a cowardly assault from a Facebook troll. By posting recordings of the fighter's defeats on social media, the attacker had been provoking him online. But when Charr offered to face the man behind the screen in person, he was subject to a drive-by shooting in a kebab shop in Essen. “He knows my story. Two shots can’t stop me, two new hip operations can’t stop me. Who is he to stop me?Eventually, Mahmoud Charr was the target of an assassination attempt when he agreed to confront the man behind the screen in person. Charr had two tune-up fights afterwards but later needed a double replacement, undergoing surgery in 2017 at the age of just 32. The same year, he went on to win the WBA’s secondary world title and has won his last five bouts.Charr told SunSport in 2022, “I am not afraid of anyone.

Tom Brady’s ‘IYKYK’ watch flex landed right after his Lions-Bears broadcast

Alix Earle’s family TikTok joke added fuel to the St. Barths talk





Tom Brady posted a close-up of his wrist on Instagram over the weekend, and he made the caption do the talking. The retired quarterback wrote, “IYKYK,” as he showed off an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar that was reported to be worth about $482,985.Hours later, the Alix Earle dating chatter got fresh oxygen from her own family circle. Her stepmom posted a TikTok that included a joke from her father, and the timing did Brady no favors as New Year’s Eve clips in St. Barths kept circulating.Brady’s Instagram story drew attention because the watch was not subtle. Ankita Yadav reported the piece was an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, valued around $482,985, with a ceramic case, a blue dial under sapphire crystal, and a blue ceramic strap.The post hit right after Brady worked as a FOX Sports broadcaster during the Detroit Lions vs. Chicago Bears game. He also made headlines for a tight end comparison during that broadcast. Brady called Bears rookie Colston Loveland “a little mini Gronk,” referencing former Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski. Chicago lost 19-16.Brady also posted a longer New Year’s message last week, and he did it in the same reflective tone he tends to use when he is not talking football.He wrote, ""Happy new year to you all… For me, The end of the year always helps to put things into perspective. Growth doesn’t really happen unless you’re willing to challenge yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. That’s something I try to live by and keep coming back to as I learn more with each passing year,"" while sharing photos that included his kids.On Monday, Jan. 5, Jackie Longo reported that Earle’s stepmother, Ashley Earle, posted a TikTok while getting ready in a blue velvet blazer that belonged to her husband, Thomas “TJ” Earle. TJ leaned into the Brady buzz in the clip. He said, “I actually got that jacket because I saw Tom Brady wearing one like that,” and when Ashley pressed him, he doubled down with, “I swear to God,"" then Ashley told him she was not “cutting” the comment out.The jokes landed because the original rumor wave already had video behind it. Longo reported that a video obtained by “TMZ” showed Earle rubbing Brady’s back and whispering in his ear at a St. Barths nightclub on New Year’s Eve. Longo also cited a source speaking to ""Us Weekly"" who claimed, “Alix and Tom were together the entire night on New Year’s Eve partying at a party hosted by Palm Tree Crew in St. Barths,” and added, “They met through mutual friends who were also in St. Barths and had an instant connection. There was a lot of chemistry between them.”That same source also tried to lower the temperature, saying, ""It’s nothing serious between her and Tom,” and, “They were together laughing, dancing and partying, enjoying themselves.” Longo noted Earle recently split from Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios and reported she is not looking for anything serious right now.Earle did not directly address Brady by name in her own post, but she did nod at the moment online.

Deposed Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro appeared in a New York federal court this week after being brought to the United States following a dramatic US military operation in Caracas. The hearing, held in Manhattan, marked Maduro’s first formal response to sweeping US charges, including narco-terrorism, and set the tone for what is expected to be a long and politically charged legal battle.Barry J Pollack is widely regarded as one of the most experienced criminal defence lawyers in the US, with more than three decades of work as a lawyer.During the proceedings, Maduro firmly rejected the accusations. Addressing the court, he said: “I am innocent. I am not guilty of anything that is mentioned here.” His wife, Cilia Flores, also entered a not guilty plea after confirming her identity through a Spanish interpreter. “I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela,” she said, before adding: “Not guilty. Completely innocent.”The judge, Alvin Hellerstein, formally entered a plea of not guilty on Maduro’s behalf. The hearing briefly turned to questions of status and jurisdiction, with Maduro insisting he remained Venezuela’s lawful leader.“I’m still the president of my country,” he was quoted as saying.Near the end of the hearing, Pollack told the court that his client “is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege” that status provides. He also raised “questions about the legality of his military abduction” and warned there would be “voluminous” pretrial filings challenging the case.The next hearing will be on March 17.","Barry j pollack is widely regarded as one of the most experienced criminal defence lawyers in the us.
