'Own wedding trip cancelled'



'Travel ban'



'Who's next?'



Indian H-1B visa holders in US described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after Donald Trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on Saturday.The sudden move, coming just weeks before Diwali and the year-end holiday season, has left families in turmoil, many cancelling flights at the last minute, including one individual who called off their own wedding trip to India. With the new rule linked to restrictions on re-entry, even those holding valid visas fear being stranded abroad.US admin, however, tried to bring order to chaos saying that those leaving the country or visiting India ""don't need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee"", adding that the fee was ""only for new and not current existing holders.""An individual revealed how a person cancelled their own wedding trip last minute ""because they don't know what to do.”“People who are standing in boarding lines at airports, people who are leaving for their own wedding tomorrow, things like that. They are cancelling because they don't know what to do,” PTI quoted them saying.Moreover, one said how people have cancelled Diwali plans and December holiday plans because of the move.“People had plans to travel to India for Diwali. They're all in a flux and not sure what to do. Families book tickets for Diwali, for the December holiday season well in advance. This is the time when most people travel,"" they said.“This is the time when people actually want to leave and be with family during the holiday season. Now this has happened. Does that mean that I cannot travel this year? That’s another sense of ‘oh my god’,” they added.Terming it a ""travel ban"", one person questioned the administration over lack of clarity over procedure regarding the move.“This is a travel ban! Even if a person has a valid H-1B visa stamped on their passport, if they are travelling, or are on vacation, you cannot enter the US unless they have proof of the USD 1,00,000 payment. No one knows what the process is, what the fine print is. There’s absolute panic,” PTI quoted the person saying.Citing internal memos by major tech companies, one said, “The biggest question that has come out is that you cannot leave the country.”The memos advised employees against travelling abroad and urged those already outside the US to return before the September 21 deadline, when Trump’s proclamation is set to take effect.“The number one thing that all of the employers are just saying is that if you are inside the country right now, do not leave,” PTI quoted one saying.Raising doubts over who could be the new target of Trump's tightening of immigration rules, one asked, “Will students on F-1 visas or those on L-1 work visas be next.”“What happens to my spouse who's on a H4 visa, can they travel? None of these things are super clear. Another thing that has caused panic for a lot of people is that when such news comes out, nobody talks about the specifics. Nobody's able to help,” PTI quoted them saying.","Indian h-1b visa holders in us described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after donald trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on saturday.

'Retired judges not keen on heading tribunals': Union minister Jitendra Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retired-judges-not-keen-on-heading-tribunals-union-minister-jitendra-singh/articleshow/124022859.cms,"Union minister Jitendra Singh (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh said Saturday that administrative members had to be allowed to head Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) benches as not many retired judges and senior judicial officers were keen to accept post-retirement assignments in the tribunal. Addressing the 10th All India Conference of CAT, Singh said the job offer was not attractive or they had more lucrative avenues at hand.""We can't talk much about this because if we do then judges will get angry. If a common man gets angry, then the judge can reprimand him. But if a judge gets angry, no one can reprimand him,"" he said.CJI BR Gavai said govt must improve the service condition of judicial and administrative members of CAT to attract more retired judges and judicial officers to take up the assignments.CAT comprises a chairman and members who can be drawn from the judicial field or administrative side, the latter usually being experienced public administrators.Ahead of his remarks on CAT administrative members being averse to ruling against govt, the CJI said, ""nowadays one does not know how his statement would be portrayed in social media"". He was reflecting on his recent brush with the untamed communication medium's portrayal of his remarks while dismissing a PIL seeking restoration of the decapitated idol of Lord Vishnu at Khajuraho.The CJI's remark appeared to be a riposte to Singh who said though late Arun Jaitley was against making administrative members head the bench on the ground that they would not know how to write judgments, he was convinced by 2-3 senior bureaucrats that senior civil servants, after a service of 30-35 years, are well acquainted with service laws and can write judgments. ""We brought an amendment allowing administrative members to head CAT benches,"" the minister said.The CJI also said judges must exercise their powers with humility and responsibility. Referring to a two month-old incident of a young lawyer fainting in the courtroom after being rebuked by a Bombay HC judge, Justice Gavai said, ""Due to conduct of some judges, there is discontent among lawyers. A young lawyer lost consciousness after being browbeaten by a HC judge. Lawyers and judges are equal partners in the justice delivery system and both need to collaborate for efficient functioning of the justice delivery mechanism. ""CJI Gavai, law minister Arun Ram Meghwal, Singh and attorney general R Venkataramani were on the same page on rising litigation in CAT despite its 95% disposal rate. All three agreed that bureaucrats need not authorise appeal against every CAT judgment. The CJI suggested a screening mechanism through a nodal officer to eliminate unnecessary filing of appeals, to which both Meghwal and Singh agreed.Singh said the govt had fixed 40 indices for categorisation as 'aspirational districts', a concept which he said is being replicated in other countries.",Union minister jitendra singh said administrative members had to be allowed to head central administrative tribunal (cat) benches.

"Indian techie shot dead by US police: What cops claim, what kin allege - 10 things to know about the incident",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-student-shot-dead-by-us-police-what-cops-claim-what-kin-allege-10-things-to-know-about-the-incident/articleshow/123988190.cms,"Poll Do you think more measures are needed to protect citizens abroad? Yes, more measures required No, current measures are adequate

Here are ten things to know about the incident:

A 32-year-old man from Telangana’s Mahabubnagar district, Mohammad Nizamuddin, who had moved to the United States in 2016 to pursue higher education, was allegedly shot dead by police in Santa Clara, California on September 3. Nizamuddin had first studied at Florida College before joining a private company, where his performance earned him a promotion that eventually took him to California, according to his family’s account. His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, a retired teacher, expressed shock and grief, saying he was informed only recently about his son’s killing, which reportedly occurred weeks earlier in the United States. The family claimed they were left in the dark for nearly two weeks, learning about Nizamuddin’s death only on September 18, when a friend from Raichur, Karnataka, informed them of the tragic news. According to reports, the incident began with a quarrel among roommates over an air-conditioning issue, which escalated into a violent scuffle involving knives before neighbors called police for help. The Santa Clara Police department said its officers responded to a 911 call reporting a stabbing, encountered Nizamuddin holding a knife, and opened fire, which led to him being shot. Police chief Cory Morgan defended the officer’s actions, saying that the shooting likely prevented further harm and may have saved the life of another roommate who had already been stabbed. Nizamuddin’s relatives, however, have raised questions about the speed of the police response, alleging that no proper inquiry was conducted before shots were fired, leaving the family with unanswered concerns. His body remains in a hospital in California awaiting formalities, while his grieving family in Mahabubnagar has appealed to both the Indian government and the Telangana state government to repatriate his remains. Nizamuddin’s father and community representatives, including Majlis Bachao Tehreek leader Amjed Ullah Khan, have urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene urgently and help bring his body back to India so the family can perform last rites in their hometown.

NEW DELHI: The death of Indian techie Mohammed Nizamuddin in Santa Clara, California, has drawn strong reactions, with police describing him as an armed aggressor, his family alleging a hasty and excessive response, neighbours recalling a domestic quarrel that turned deadly, and him alleging workplace racial harassment, including ""wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of justice.Santa Clara police said they were called to a residence on September 3 after reports of a stabbing, where they found Nizamuddin allegedly armed with a knife after attacking his roommate. Officers claimed he ignored commands and appeared poised to strike again, prompting them to open fire, fatally wounding him, while his injured roommate was hospitalized and two knives were recovered from the scene.The family of Nizamuddin alleged that the shooting ""happened so quickly."" His father, Mohammad Hasanuddin, said they were only informed weeks after the September 3 incident.""The account says the roommates had a quarrel -- something about the AC or something in the room -- and in the ensuing scuffle knives were involved. A neighbour phoned the police. When the police entered the room, they asked the occupants to show their hands. One boy complied; the other did not. The police then fired four rounds and the child was shot.It is extremely regrettable that, according to the reports, no proper inquiry took place and the shooting happened so quickly,"" ANI quoted a relative said.The family of the Telangana man has appealed to the external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter and help bring back Mohammad Nizamuddin's body.Indian consulate expressed condolences and assured ""all possible consular assistance."" ""We are saddened by the death of an Indian national, Mr. Mohammed Nizamuddin, in an incident involving Santa Clara Police. We are in contact with the local authorities & the family, and we will extend all possible consular assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family in this difficult time,"" it said.He accused his employer of ""wrongfully"" terminating his employment and continued ""harassment, discrimination and intimidating behavior by the help of a racist detective and team.""""I have been a victim of racial hatred, racial discrimination, racial harassment, torture, wage-fraud, wrongful termination and obstruction of Justice,"" the post on LinkedIn read.","Mohammed nizamuddin, a 32-year-old man from telangana's mahabubnagar district, was allegedly shot dead by police in santa clara, california on september 3.

'Another setback': Congress attacks PM Modi over Pak-Saudi defence pact; flags national security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-setback-congress-attacks-pm-modi-over-pak-saudi-defence-pact-flags-national-security-concerns/articleshow/123973987.cms,"Poll Do you believe the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence pact poses a significant threat to India's national security? Yes, it's a serious concern No, it's manageable

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence pact, calling it a matter of grave concern for India’s security and another failure of what it described as “personality-driven diplomacy. ”Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said, “One month after abruptly halting Operation Sindoor, President Trump hosted Field Marshal Asim Munir for lunch at the White House—the very individual whose inflammatory, provocative, and communally divisive statements provided oxygen to the brutal terrorist attacks in Pahalgam in April 2025. Just days after our Prime Minister’s much-publicised visit to China, President Xi Jinping opened the doors of China’s covert military complex to Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari. Now, Saudi Arabia—where the Prime Minister was present during the Pahalgam terrorist attacks on 22 April 2025—has signed a ‘strategic mutual defence’ agreement with Pakistan. This is undoubtedly a matter of grave concern for India’s national security. The Indian National Congress expresses deep concern over this and considers it yet another setback for our Prime Minister’s highly publicised personality-driven diplomacy.”Earlier today, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan announced the signing of a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Riyadh.The pact pledges mutual support in the event of external aggression and marks a transition from decades of informal security cooperation to an institutionalised military framework. “This agreement…aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” a joint statement said.Also read - Defence pact: Pakistan-Saudi Arabia declare joint response to any aggression; India reacts A senior Saudi official told Reuters the deal was the result of “years of discussions” and not linked to any recent conflict, while declining to clarify whether Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal was covered under its scope. The announcement comes shortly after a joint Arab League and OIC session convened in response to Israel’s strike on Doha earlier this month.India, meanwhile, said it had been aware of discussions on the pact. External affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal stated, “We have seen reports of the signing of a strategic mutual defence pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The government was aware that this development, which formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration. We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India's national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.”Despite the defence alignment with Islamabad, a Saudi official said that Riyadh’s relationship with India remained strong. “Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship,” the official said.Meanwhile, union minister Piyush Goyal said, ""I am not aware of the details of that. I was busy with my meetings in the UAE. So, I think I will refrain from commenting on this subject. But as far as our relations with the UAE go, they are very strong. They are underpinned by deep relationship between Prime Minister Modi and His Highness the President of UAE. At every level, from people to people contact, business exchanges and government and leadership levels. We are very close to each other, and I don't think the UAE-India relationship will be affected by any of these developments.""",The congress criticised prime minister narendra modi over the pakistan-saudi arabia defence pact.

"$100k for H-1B visa: Not an annual fee, says Trump official; issues 3-point clarification for existing holders & new applicants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/100k-h1-b-visa-fee-not-annual-says-donald-trump-official-issues-3-point-clarification-for-existing-holders-new-applicants/articleshow/124021001.cms,"Trump signed the order raising H1-B visa application fees to $100,000

This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the country to the same extent as they normally would; whatever ability they have to do that is not impacted by yesterday’s proclamation. This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.





The recently announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the White House press secretary clarified on Saturday. The announcement comes after widespread confusion and concern over the implications of a presidential proclamation signed Friday by US President Donald Trump The proclamation, titled “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” introduced a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, significantly increasing the fee from the current $2,000–5,000 range to $100,000. The move sparked fears among immigration attorneys, Indian IT professionals, and companies that holders outside the US might face urgent deadlines to return, and raised questions about potential disruption to the country’s tech talent pipeline.In response, the White House press secretary clarified the following points:This comes amid reports that companies asked employees on visit to India to rush back to avoid the fees.Amid the chaos, a senior US administration official told ANI also, “Those visiting or leaving the country, or traveling to India, do not need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee,"" echoing similar statement to Levitt's adding, ""It is applicable only for new visa applications.”Industry representatives in both India and the US have highlighted that H-1B talent mobility is crucial for innovation, economic growth, and technological development. The White House said policymakers will continue to assess the steps, taking into account mutual benefits, including strong people-to-people ties between the two countries.","The $100,000 h-1b visa fee will apply only to new visa applications and is not an annual charge, the white house press secretary clarified.

Why Ryan Helsley is being linked to Chicago

The gamble vs reward involved in this trade for the Cubs

Here’s a quick breakdown of the situation:

Aspect Pros Cons Cubs’ bullpen need



Helsley could fill in immediately with Palencia sidelined



Risk if Palencia cannot return and Helsley also struggles



Helsley’s profile



Proven velocity and dominance before trade



Performance fell sharply with Mets



Financial side



Lowered price tag after poor Mets stint



Still requires multiyear commitment





Themay be forced to take a bold approach in fixing their bullpen this winter. With injuries and underperformance leaving their closer situation in flux, Sports Illustrated’s Zach Pressnell suggests the team could take a chance on, a once-dominant reliever whose stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the New York Mets.The Cubs entered the season with Ryan Pressly as their designated closer after signing him over the winter. However, Pressly’s struggles quickly led to a change. Daniel Palencia stepped in and thrived in the role, becoming a steady presence at the back of the bullpen.• Palencia appeared in 52 games this year• He posted a 3.00 ERA across 51 innings• He converted 22 saves before suffering a right shoulder strainPalencia is now on the 15-day injured list, and his postseason availability remains uncertain. This setback leaves the Cubs with a significant hole in their bullpen as they prepare for potential October baseball.The Mets acquired Ryan Helsley at the trade deadline in an effort to boost their relief corps. But his performance took a nosedive after joining New York. While he pitched effectively in the first half of the season, his struggles in a Mets uniform have diminished his free-agent value heading into the offseason.Pressnell believes this is where the Cubs could pounce: “Helsley was dominant in the first half, but fell off when he joined the Mets. His price tag is likely a bit lower now than it was a few months ago, though his talent is still there. The Cubs could target him on a four-year deal to make the flamethrower the closer of the future in the Windy City.” – Zach Pressnell, Sports IllustratedIf the Cubs pursue Helsley, it will be a calculated risk. His struggles in New York have raised questions, but his track record shows he has the talent to dominate when healthy and confident.The Cubs are expected to target bullpen help this winter regardless of Palencia’s health status. Helsley represents a high-risk, high-reward option. If he returns to his pre-trade form, he could become one of the biggest steals of the offseason and stabilize the closer role in Chicago for years.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Reportedly Eyeing $120 Million Boston Red Sox All-Star in Aggressive Free Agency Pursuit The coming months will determine if the Cubs are willing to take that gamble and make Helsley a key piece of their future bullpen plans.","Ryan helsley's stock has dropped following a disappointing stint with the new york mets.

Judge sides with defense arguments centered on rehabilitation



Impact on Ricky Pearsall and wider NFL community

A California court has ruled that the teenager accused of shooting San Francisco 49ers rookie wide receiver Ricky Pearsall during an attempted robbery in 2024 will face trial as a juvenile, not an adult. The decision could drastically shape both the legal outcome and the broader debate on how violent crimes committed by minors should be prosecuted.The suspect, who was 17 at the time of the incident and is now 18, was charged with attempted murder, assault, and attempted robbery. Prosecutors argued the seriousness of the crime warranted an adult trial, but defense attorneys countered with a different perspective. They highlighted the teen’s history of childhood abuse and noted his record as a ""model prisoner"" during juvenile detention.Their case leaned heavily on the belief that rehabilitation, not long-term incarceration, would better serve both the suspect and society. After a weeklong hearing, the judge sided with the defense, ruling that the case will remain in juvenile court. If convicted, the teen could face detention and rehabilitative programs until adulthood, but he will not face the decades-long sentence possible under adult charges.Ricky Pearsall, a first-round pick for the 49ers in the 2024 NFL Draft, survived the shooting and has since returned to football activities. Still, the incident cast a shadow over the start of his professional career and sparked public debate.Also Read: NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game For the NFL and its fans, the case is more than just a legal battle—it underscores the risks athletes face off the field and raises bigger questions about how the justice system treats violent offenses committed by minors.

Trump’s Big Strike On Indians; $100,000 Fee Slapped On H-1B Visas





The US administration plans a major change to the H-1B visa programme, with President Donald Trump expected to sign a proclamation Friday imposing a $100,000 application fee, according to a White House official, quoted in a Bloomberg report.The order is intended to curb misuse of the visa category and its perceived impact on American jobs. Entry under the programme would require the hefty payment, the official said (anonymously), while the Labour Secretary will be directed to begin revising H-1B wage rules to protect US workers from wage suppression.The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects. The White House argues the new measures will bolster the integrity of the system and reduce exploitation. A document reviewed by Bloomberg News describes the replacement of American workers with lower-cost foreign labour as a national-security issue that discourages domestic STEM careers.It remains unclear whether the $100,000 fee will be added to or replace existing charges. Current costs include a $215 lottery registration and a $780 Form I-129 filing.The programme grants 85,000 visas annually through a lottery that some firms allegedly game by submitting multiple applications, often to hire lower-paid staff via staffing and outsourcing companies.This move aligns with broader immigration fee hikes for work permits, asylum requests and other services, intended to fund detention facilities, expanded border barriers and additional enforcement personnel.","The technology sector, a heavy user of h-1b visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects.
