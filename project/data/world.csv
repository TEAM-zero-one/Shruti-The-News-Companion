First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31am ET (12.01pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six year old son, Kiash, fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu.

NEW DELHI: India has asked China to constructively work towards a ""permanent solution"" to the border issue under a structured roadmap to bridge trust deficit, de-escalate tensions and rejuvenate the existing mechanism to demarcate it, even as their armies continue to be forward deployed against each other along the frontier for the last five years.Defence minister Rajnath Singh also told his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, on the sidelines of the SCO conclave Thursday that Beijing should understand and respect India's ""principled approach"" to defend itself against cross-border terror sponsored by Pakistan, officials told TOI.Briefing Admiral Dong about the ""heinous"" Pahalgam massacre and the subsequent Operation Sindoor launched by India against terrorist networks in Pakistan, Singh said both New Delhi and Beijing should ""avoid adding new complexities"" to their bilateral relationship.his came in the backdrop of Pakistan using a wide array of Chinese weapons, including J-10 fighters firing the PL-15 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, against India during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10. Under their deep military collusiveness, China is now also going to supply Pakistan with at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets and HQ-19 long-range air defence missile systems.

Acknowledging efforts by both sides to bring back a ""semblance of normalcy"" in bilateral ties, Singh also put forward a four-point plan to put the overall relationship on an upward trajectory, officials told TOI.This involves both sides first strictly adhering to the plan that led to troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh last Oct, which has reduced the risk of any inadvertent escalation. They should now move forward to the next steps of de-escalation and de-induction of troops from their forward deployments along the LAC.The two countries should also accelerate efforts to achieve the goal of demarcation and delimitation of the border and register concrete progress in the existing special representatives (SR) level mechanism to achieve a fair and mutually-acceptable solution to the boundary question and other issues.The forward momentum in bilateral ties has gained ground since national security advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi discussed various issues under the SR mechanism in Beijing last Dec for the first time since 2019.""Singh said India and China should not remain stuck in the past. He called for bridging the trust deficit created after the border standoff in 2020 by taking action on the ground,"" an official said.""The two ministers agreed to continue consultations at various levels to achieve progress on issues related to disengagement, de-escalation, border management and eventual de-limitation through existing mechanisms,"" he added.","Defence minister rajnath singh told his chinese counterpart, admiral dong jun, on the sidelines of the sco conclave thursday.

NEW DELHI: In a major development, Mumbai-based defence shipyard Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's largest shipyard, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC), in a deal worth almost $53 million.The move marks the first international acquisition by India's largest shipyard that builds submarines, warships and other vessels, and will provide it with a 'strategic foothold' in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).China, of course, has made deep strategic inroads into Sri Lanka. Chinese Navy's expanding presence in IOR, along with its hunt for additional logistical hubs in the region, has emerged as a major security challenge for India.The $53 million investment will be carried out through a combination of primary infusion and secondary share purchases, including the acquisition of shares from Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd, the current majority shareholder.Upon completion, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC) will become a subsidiary of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). Mazagon Dock chairman and managing director Capt Jagmohan told TOI that the proposed acquisition of a controlling stake in CDPLC, which has been approved, is a ""gateway"" towards achieving the shipyard's ambition of transforming into a regional maritime player first and then into a global shipbuilding enterprise.""With CDPLC's strategic location at Colombo port, proven capabilities, and strong regional presence, this step will position MDL as a key player in South Asia and lay the foundation for our emergence as a global shipyard,"" Capt Jagmohan said.CDPLC has more than five decades of experience in shipbuilding, ship repair and heavy engineering. ""It has a track record of delivering complex offshore support vessels, cable-laying ships, tankers and patrol boats for clients across Japan, Norway, France, the UAE, India and several African nations,"" another MDL official said.CDPLC is currently pursuing a pipeline of orders over $300 million, which includes cable-laying ships, multi-purpose utility ships and newbuild fleet support vessels.""With MDL's support, particularly in technology sharing, access to Indian supply chains, and entry into Indian and allied maritime markets, CDPLC is well positioned for a financial turnaround and long-term growth,"" the official said.MDL, on its part, continues to do well in India. In partnership with German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), MDL is on course to bag the mega project to build six new stealth diesel-electric submarines for the Navy. The initial cost of these submarines, with both land-attack cruise missiles and air-independent propulsion (AIP) for greater underwater endurance, was estimated to be around Rs 43,000 crore when it got the 'acceptance of necessity (AoN)' by the defence ministry several years ago. It will now be around Rs 70,000 crore, as reported earlier by TOI.Another major contract for MDL in the pipeline is the proposed construction of another three French-origin Scorpene submarines with AIP at a cost of around Rs 38,000 crore. These three new submarines, if approved, will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.","Mazagon dock shipbuilders limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in sri lanka's largest shipyard, colombo dockyard plc (cdplc) the $53 million investment will be carried out through a combination of primary infusion and secondary share purchases.

India Will Talk To Pakistan Only On Terror, No Indus Water For Now: Jaishankar's BIG WARNING

NEW DELHI: India on Friday dismissed the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal, firmly rejecting its authority.The ministry of external affairs snubbed the “supplemental award” by the ""illegal"" Court of Arbitration for asserting its authority to hear the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower cases in Jammu and Kashmir.The ministry also highlighted that the court was constituted in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.Supplemental award issued by the Court of Arbitration refers to a follow-up decision specifically on whether the tribunal has the legal authority (competence) to hear the case about India’s Kishenganga and Ratle projects -- not on the projects themselves, but on the court’s jurisdiction.""India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,"" the MEA statement said.After the dastardly Pakistan-backed terrorist attack in Pahalgam, the government placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.In a strong statement, the foreign ministry said the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.""Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under it,"" the statement said.""India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body,"" the issue read.Calling the move a ""charade at Pakistan’s behest"", the government called the ""supplemental award"" another desperate attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.""Pakistan's resort to this fabricated arbitration mechanism is consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums,"" the ministry added.This year in January, a neutral expert upheld India's stand after seven questions were raised in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects on matters related to the Indus water treaty.""India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven (07) questions that were referred to the Neutral Expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the Treaty,"" MEA said after the decision.""It has been India’s consistent and principled position that the Neutral Expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences. Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,"" it added.In 2017, the World Bank, which is the facilitator of the treaty, had said that India was allowed to construct hydroelectric power facilities on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers with certain restrictions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan.India is, however, permitted to use the water of western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.Though India has right to create water storage capacity up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers as per IWT, not enough storage capacity has been created. Besides, out of estimated power potential of 20,000 MW, which can be harnessed from power projects on western rivers, only 3,482 MW capacity has been constructed.","India rejects the court of arbitration under the 1960 indus waters treaty as illegal.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by tehreek-e-taliban pakistan (ttp) fighters in waziristan.

These individuals aren’t simply shadowing American counterparts; they’re embedded observers in restricted environments where much of the true know-how of human spaceflight resides.For instance, on the day the Dragon capsule docked with the ISS, the Isro team was not just allowed into the JSC to watch operations unfold live. “We were on the audio loop, listening to mission control discussions. We saw what control operations did, how many docking attempts were made, what kind of error parameters were being monitored. These are not things you’ll find in any public webcast or document,” the official said.While Nasa does publish mission sequences, the real-time judgement calls, procedural fluidity, and console data are generally inaccessible to the outside world — unless, as in this case, you’re a partner with boots on the ground.Isro’s access will deepen further. “They’re setting up a dedicated conference room for us, where live console data will flow in,” the official said. There’s more than docking being studied.With Gaganyaan planning to carry out multiple docking ops in the years ahead — and with India’s future space station on the horizon — Isro engineers are keen to absorb the choreography of mission ops in real environments.“We’ve done one docking so far. But a space station will require many. Watching this from inside Nasa's systems gives us critical learning that we can’t replicate in India just yet.”Medical operations, too, are under the Isro lens. Two doctors from the agency are part of the Houston team and are already participating in alternate-day medical conferences with Shukla aboard the ISS.“It’s a private medical conference link—used routinely by Nasa and Axiom—and our doctors are now involved in that process. This is how they’ll learn the medical rhythms of human spaceflight,” the official said.As part of India’s learning curve in astronaut rehabilitation and post-flight recovery, the doctors will also observe Shukla’s reconditioning phases, both immediately after his return and during follow-up weeks in the US.The team is split between Axiom’s control centre and JSC’s, depending on the operation. While JSC largely handles docking and mission dynamics, Axiom leads crew management, flight surgeon coordination and private astronaut interfaces.Axiom’s mission centre is where people from Hungary and Poland are stationed too but because they don’t have Nasa agreement like Isro does, they don’t have JSC access like the Indian space agency. Shux Floats, Isro Digs In At Houston To Watch & Learn.","Group captain shubhanshu shukla may be astronaut number 634, but he is far from the only indian drawing value from the axiom-4 mission.

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties strongly criticised RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale's suggestion to review 'socialist' and 'secular' words in the Preamble, viewing it as an attack on the Constitution's essence.At an Emergency-focused event, Hosabale had stated that these terms weren't in Ambedkar's original Preamble and suggested reconsidering their inclusion. Union minister Jitendra Singh supported this view, noting these weren't part of the original Constitution.The Congress and CPI(M) voiced strong objections following the RSS's proposal to review these terms, which were incorporated during the Emergency period and weren't in Ambedkar's original draft.Rahul Gandhi posted on X: ""The Constitution irks them because it speaks of equality, secularism, and justice. The RSS-BJP doesn't want the Constitution; they want 'Manusmriti'. They aim to strip the marginalized and the poor of their rights and enslave them again. Snatching a powerful weapon like the Constitution from them is their real agenda.""Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan criticised the move, noting the RSS' previous association with Indira Gandhi's government.""RSS General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale’s call to review secularism and socialism in the Indian Constitution is a brazen attempt to dismantle the core ideals of our Republic. Invoking the emergency to discredit these principles is a deceitful move, especially when the RSS colluded with the Indira Gandhi Government during that time for its own survival. To use that period now to undermine the Constitution reflects sheer hypocrisy and political opportunism. Secularism and socialism are not additions; they define India. Every citizen who believes in democracy must raise their voice against this communal agenda,"" he wrote on X.Left parties and RJD suggested this was part of a broader plan to alter the Constitution.Congress' Jairam Ramesh highlighted the BJP/RSS's historical opposition to the Constitution since November 30, 1949. Taking to X, Ramesh wrote, ""The RSS has NEVER accepted the Constitution of India. It attacked Dr. Ambedkar, Nehru, and others involved in its framing from Nov 30, 1949 onwards. In the RSS's own words, the Constitution was not inspired by Manusmriti. The RSS and the BJP have repeatedly given the call for a new Constitution. """"This was Mr. Modi's campaign cry during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India decisively rejected this cry. Yet the demands for changing the basic structure of the Constitution continues to be made by the RSS ecosystem. The Chief Justice of India himself delivered a judgment on November 25, 2024 on the issue now being raised by a leading RSS functionary. Would it be asking too much to request him to take the trouble to read it?"" he added.The party's official stance emphasised their commitment to protecting constitutional values.K C Venugopal pointed out that the Supreme Court had established socialism and secularism as fundamental to the Constitution's structure. ""The RSS’ single-minded focus to destroy the Constitution is never hidden for too long. Beyond the BJP’s lip service to the Constitution, their hidden agenda has always been to distort and destroy our Constitution - because it stands against the core fascist beliefs of the RSS-BJP. A senior RSS member surely knows that the Supreme Court declared socialism and secularism to be part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Yet, to take this stand is a clear insult to the Constitution, a rejection of its values, and a direct attack on the Supreme Court of India as well. The people of India know very well the devious means deployed by the RSS to spread poison and divide this country. We will never let them succeed in this mission, and will defend the Constitution to the hilt,"" wrote Venugopal.RJD president Lalu Prasad expressed concerns about threats to social justice and communal harmony. ""The country's largest casteist and hateful organisation, RSS, has talked about changing the Constitution. They don't have the courage to even glance at the Constitution and reservations. Why do people with an unjust character harbour such hatred in their minds and thoughts towards democracy and Baba Saheb's Constitution?"" wrote Lalu in Hindi.The CPI(M) Politburo issued a statement defending the inclusion of these terms as reflective of freedom fighters' core values. CPI general secretary D Raja emphasised the importance of defending the Constitution.BJP responded by accusing Congress of historical constitutional violations and called for acknowledgment of Emergency-era transgressions instead of creating diversions.",Opposition parties strongly criticised rss general secretary dattatreya hosabale's suggestion to review'socialist' and'secular' words in the preamble.

NEW DELHI: Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday. Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later. Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.""The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way.

The lab is compliant with international standards. A team of over 20 experts from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US, who arrived in Ahmedabad on June 13, are now in the Capital, examining the data with Indian experts.The delay in announcing the composition of the team probing the AI-171 crash a fortnight after the accident has raised questions about the investigation. The govt statement defended the process followed.""Following the unfortunate accident (on June 12), AAIB promptly initiated an investigation and constituted a multi-disciplinary team on June 13, 2025, in line with prescribed norms. The team, constituted as per international protocol, is led by DG AAIB, and includes an aviation medicine specialist, an air traffic control (ATC) officer, and representatives from NTSB which is the govt investigating agency from the state of manufacture and design (US), as required for such investigations,"" it said.

NEW DELHI: Finding Pakistan teaming up with China to push its line on terrorism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers' meet at Qingdao, India Thursday refused to sign the proposed joint statement as it would've diluted its consistent stand on the scourge endangering regional peace and stability.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as defence minister Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.Also read: ‘Proposal objected by one particular country,’ MEA on why Rajnath Singh refused to sign SCO statement There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it, sources told TOI.Pakistan was especially keen to include Jaffar Express hijacking in its restive Balochistan province in March in the joint document. Pakistan frequently accuses India of fomenting the ongoing insurgency for greater autonomy and independence in Balochistan.India, on its part, has consistently rejected all such ""baseless"" allegations.""The Indian delegation led by Rajnath Singh had serious objections to the draft joint statement and its language, which reeked of double standards in dealing with a serious issue like terrorism,"" a source said.

""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further crossborder terrorist attacks, India on May 7 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross-border terrorist infrastructure,"" Singh said.India's zero tolerance for terrorism was manifested through its actions, he said.

Chandi Dayle's retirement brings an end to an era



Veteran Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader member Chandi Dayle was caught in the middle of a scandal during Season 2 of America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders on Netflix. The experienced performer and former team leader was under fire after a serious rules infraction during the team's visit to the Bahamas, ultimately resigning from leadership and eventually retiring.The Netflix docuseries’ second season, released on June 18, chronicled the cheerleaders' high-pressure training camp and performances, culminating in an off-field incident involving Chandi Dayle that fractured team dynamics.At the Bahamas retreat, Chandi Dayle—a sixth-year veteran at the time and the 2024–25 team's longest-serving member—allegedly brought an unauthorized person into the private hotel space of the team, an explicit violation of Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) policy. The man was not disclosed to teammates, raising genuine safety and trust concerns.Chandi Dayle said the encounter was rooted in emotional distress. She talked to the man about personal issues and averred their encounter was just conversational. ""It was probably the wrong place and time to do that, but selfishly, I had to do it for me because I feel like I was just losing it,"" she admitted.Later in the season, Chandi Dayle went on a leave of absence.Team head choreographer Judy Trammell said that Dayle needed to attend to her mental health, and rehearsals went on without her. Fourth-year cheerleader KayDianna Garza filled the gap as a leader for a time, although she would later complain she felt unsupported.Garza eventually left the team after a scandal broke out from a TikTok Live, where she made comments about the scandal. She was suspended after footage from the livestream spread on Reddit, which led to an internal investigation. ""I needed to respect myself,"" Garza said regarding her departure.Before the controversy, Chandi Dayle was among the most recognizable faces of the DCC, with leadership qualities, charisma, and a long time staying on the team. In the Netflix series, glimpses of her private life were seen, some of them rooted in trauma in a previous relationship. In Season 2, Dayle talked about her ex-boyfriend Ryan, whom she had become involved with in the time of the pandemic. His complicated history with an allegedly abusive previous boyfriend became part of the emotional context that added to the mental strain on her during the season.Dayle went on to say, ""If I can't even organize my life and my own thoughts, I'm not gonna be able to organize a whole team."" When she came back to the squad after her leave, she chose not to return to her leadership role and described herself as relieved at the lessened pressure.Also read: “We at War?”: Cowboys linebacker Demarvion Overshown leaves fans guessing with vague social media post By season’s end, Chandi Dayle confirmed she would not return for another season with the DCC.
