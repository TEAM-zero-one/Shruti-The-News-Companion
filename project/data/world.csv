The quiet strength of humility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-quiet-strength-of-humility/articleshow/119985268.cms,"

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

A disquieting transformation can be seen unfolding before us if we observe the glittering talk shows, blockbuster films, the viral social media clips - humility's quiet retreat. In its place, aggressiveness, vanity, and pride reign supreme. Somehow, humility has been misinterpreted as self-deprecation rather than self-awareness.

As C S Lewis, the renowned British author and Anglican theologian, clarified: ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself. It's thinking of yourself less.""

I wish I had the power to change the tone of the narrative that humility is weakness, forgiveness is cowardice, and snobbery, a form of strength.

Throughout human history , spiritual traditions have exalted humility as the supreme quality that illuminates one's inner journey toward divine connection.

There is a striking commonality among the various demons In Hindu mythology—whether Mahishasur, Surapadma, Hiranyaksha, or Ravana—their inflated self-importance. These characters are dominated by 'Ahankara' or super-ego, which swells until they demand universal submission. When the world refuses to bow, they unleash torment upon humanity, necessitating their ultimate destruction by divine avatars.

The Bible echoes this sentiment: ""God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble"" while the Quran teaches that the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth humbly.

Donald Grey Barnhouse, a famous preacher, once visited a beach incognito to escape adulation. He met a young girl playing alone who told him that her parents allowed her seaside playtime while they read scriptures at home.

After their pleasant interaction, Barnhouse said: ""When you go home, Mary, tell your mother that you were playing with Donald Grey Barnhouse. She will be elated.""

Mary reflected briefly before responding: ""When you go home, Donald, tell your mother that you were playing with Mary. She will be elated too.""

The priest later described this exchange as the most humbling moment of his life.

Einstein once declined the honour of being Israel's prime minister in 1952, while cricketer Rahul Dravid declined an honorary doctorate from Bangalore University, saying he had worked hard at cricket but haven't studied enough to deserve this honour.

These luminaries remind us that humility isn't diminishment—it's expansion. We shrink through unyielding arrogance but grow through humble attempts at self-effacement. The world's strangest paradox may be this: to truly grow, one must become small.

In one of his couplets, Valluvar brings up this paradox, where he declares that modest people tower even more than the colossal mountains.

""Nilayin Thiriyaadhu Adangiyaan Thotram

Malayinum Maanap Peridhu""

The steadfast, self-controlled, humble humans stand aloft,

Taller than the mightiest mountain.

I wondered what made the saint compare humans with great mountains. Symbols of permanence in countless literary and spiritual traditions, mountains stand in silent judgment of our transience. Gazing at their majestic forms, one wonders: Do they look down upon the fleeting human drama with cosmic amusement?

RS passes waqf bill 128-95 as BJD boosts NDA numbers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-passes-waqf-bill-128-95-as-bjd-boosts-nda-numbers/articleshow/119993588.cms,"Budget session ends, both Houses adjourned sine die

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha passed the Waqf (Amendment) Bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against after a marathon 15-hour debate which started at 11am on Thursday and wound up around 2.30 am the next day.The lengthy debate, marked by acrimonious exchanges, ended with the opposition seeking a division and the bill sailing through with National Democratic alliance's (NDA's) 'secular' allies firmly in its corner.BJD's surprising decision to withdraw its whip to allow its seven members to vote as ""per their conscience"" brought a few extra votes for the governing side and took its tally beyond the anticipated 123 votes to 128. A minimum of 119 votes was required for passage, and BJP's deft floor management ensured a comfortable margin. The opposition bloc, expected to muster 98 votes, fell short at 95.The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday after nearly 14 hours of discussion, with 288 members supporting it and 232 against it. With both Houses approving the bill, it now awaits President Droupadi Murmu's assent to amend the Waqf Act of 1995.Parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, with the Rajya Sabha giving its nod. The lower house had earlier cleared the bill. The budget session of Parliament, which began on Jan 31, came to a close with both Houses being adjourned sine die on Friday.Replying to the debate, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju dismissed the opposition's charges as fear mongering, while putting up a spirited defence of the bill.""We have since yesterday consistently said that Muslims will constitute the overwhelming majority in both central waqf council and state waqf boards - 18 out of 22 and eight out of 11, in that order. Still, it was repeated ad nauseam that these bodies will be controlled by non-Muslims as a conspiracy to divest Muslims of their assets,"" the minister said.Rijiju, however, was blunt in saying that the two bodies could not be allowed to be exclusive Muslim entities either.""Their brief is not religious and disputes over waqf properties invariably involve non-Muslims,"" he said, adding that the central govt worked for all with the motto of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'.The minister said the waqf board was a statutory body and, like all govt bodies, it should be secular. He said the inclusion of a few non-Muslims on the waqf board would not alter the decisions of the body and, instead, would add value.The waqf bill debates were the budget session's highlight, with the Rajya Sabha sitting until 4.02am on Friday - echoing a 1981 session on the Essential Services Maintenance Bill that lasted until 4.43am. Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar called the 15-hour debate ""unprecedented"".Historically, Parliament has seen marathon discussions. The longest, on the 'state of our democracy', spanned 20.08 hours in the Lok Sabha, followed by the 1993 Railway Budget (18.35 hours) and the 1998 Railway Budget (18.04 hours). This session also saw swift discussions on other matters, like the ratification of President's rule in Manipur, cleared in 42 minutes by the Lok Sabha and 1.24 hours by the Rajya Sabha.","The rajya sabha passed the waqf (amendment) bill with 128 votes in favour and 95 against.

NEW DELHI: A unique argument - if the medicine for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is cheaper in Pakistan and China, why can't it be similarly priced to help those suffering from this rare disorder - persuaded Supreme Court Friday to seek response from Centre and global pharma giant Roche, the drug manufacturer.Appearing for Seba, 24, from Kerala, advocate Anand Grover told a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, & Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan that Hoffman Roche, which manufactures the patented oral medicine Risdiplam (Evrysdi), is selling the drug cheap in Pakistan and China. ""Price of the medicine for SMA patients is available at a cheaper price in Pakistan and China because of intervention of govts of those countries.

TOI on Aug 17, 2023, had published a news report about Roche's rare disease treatment drug costing up to 15 times more in India compared to neighbouring countries. The bench issued notice to Roche to get its response and asked Centre to place its stand on making the drug to treat SMA cheaper in India. Understanding the urgency involved in the case, a quick decision on which will help save many SMA patients from certain death in near future, the bench posted the matter for further hearing next week.""In India, there may be thousands of families where patients are affected with this disease. Due to lack of infrastructure , the ailment is left undetected,"" Grover said, seeking urgent intervention of SC which could save thousands of patients.","In india, a bottle of risdiplam costs rs 6.2 lakh, whereas in pakistan it is around rs 41,000 per bottle and in china rs 44,692.

""The bill was passed according to the rules of the House.

Congress members raised slogans as the Speaker delivered the valedictory address, ensuring a raucous end to the session. Sonia had made the remark while addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party on Thursday. She termed the waqf bill a ""brazen assault on the Constitution"", and claimed that it pushed through without adequate discussion. Sonia was rebutted also by parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju . Raising the issue in LS, he urged the Speaker to issue an appropriate order. He dismissed the ""bulldozed"" charge as ""baseless and absurd"" and said the Rajya Sabha debate had set a new record for the longest discussion in the Upper House.Addressing a press conference later, Rijiju defended the bill's passage and said, ""There was not a single disruption during the discussion on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill.""Meanwhile, the opposition intensified its attack on the govt over another issue - US President Donald Trump's imposition of 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian goods.

"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by thailand pm paetongtarn shinawatra.

India urges BRICS nations to unite on mobilising $1.3 trillion annually to achieve climate action goals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-urges-brics-nations-to-unite-on-mobilising-1-3-trillion-annually-to-achieve-climate-action-goals/articleshow/119952936.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday called on the BRICS group of nations to unite on the 'Baku to Belem Roadmap' to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for achieving climate action goals. The group, which earlier comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, now has 11 countries as its members, collectively negotiating for climate governance at multilateral forums, including the UN climate conference.India pitched for a collaborative approach to achieve the climate action goals—nationally determined contributions—at the 11th BRICS Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Brasilia, Brazil. The 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) will be held in Belem, Brazil, in November.Articulating the country’s stand, the Indian team led by Amandeep Garg, Additional Secretary in the Environment Ministry, urged the BRICS partners to strengthen climate financing mechanisms to meet global sustainability commitments effectively. They highlighted the urgent need for developed nations to fulfil their commitments, noting that the proposed $300 billion per year by 2035 under the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is far below the required $1.3 trillion.With BRICS nations facing common environmental challenges such as desertification, pollution, and biodiversity loss, India stressed the importance of collective action and shared responsibility. The country also reiterated its leadership in conservation and sustainability, mentioning initiatives such as the International Big Cat Alliance, a global effort for wildlife conservation.Reaffirming its commitment to working collaboratively with BRICS partners to drive transformative change in climate action, environmental cooperation, and sustainable development , India, during its participation, urged all 11 nations to join global sustainability initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), and Global Biofuel Alliance to accelerate collective climate action.BRICS nations collectively account for 47% of the world’s population and contribute 36% of global GDP. Six countries that joined the group in the past year include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Iran, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia.On energy security, India reiterated commitments made in the BRICS New Delhi Declaration (2021), which promotes a diversified energy mix, including fossil fuels, hydrogen, nuclear, and renewables.“A Just Transition must acknowledge the diverse economic realities of nations. Each country has a unique development pathway, and the provision of adequate means of implementation—in finance, technology, and capacity-building—is essential to ensuring that no nation or community is left behind in this transition. As BRICS nations, we must strengthen our engagements in multilateral forums, championing the interests of developing economies and advocating for a fair and equitable transition,” said India’s statement issued at the meeting.","India pitched for a collaborative approach to achieve the climate action goals.

NEW DELHI: The legal and political battle over the Waqf Amendment Bill , 2025 has reached the Supreme Court, with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joining Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.Both leaders have alleged that the proposed amendments infringe on the fundamental rights of Muslims and introduce discriminatory state control over Islamic religious endowments.The petitions, filed through advocate Anas Tanwir, come even before the Bill has received Presidential assent.It was passed by both Houses of Parliament amid sharp opposition.Jawed, a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that reviewed the bill, argued that the amendments violate Articles 14, 25, 26, 29, and 300A of the Constitution, which relate to equality, religious freedom, minority rights, and property. He said the bill introduces arbitrary restrictions, including one based on the duration of religious practice, which could prevent recent converts from dedicating property under waqf — a condition he said is alien to Islamic law, reported Bar and Bench.Another contentious change flagged in the petition is the proposed inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council. “This selective intervention lacks any reasonable justification and constitutes an arbitrary classification,” the plea mentioned, noting that similar interference is absent in the governance of Hindu or Sikh religious trusts.Speaking to the media, Jawed said, “Several people in India will file this petition, several parties will do this... In the Parliament, everyone in the Opposition said that this is unconstitutional... How can you snatch away our right? If you have numbers, it doesn’t mean you get passed anything you want and do something unlawful.”AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has also called the Bill a “brazen violation” of the Muslim community’s rights.During the debate in Parliament, he tore a copy of the legislation, comparing his act to Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience in South Africa. “Like Gandhi, I am also tearing up this law. This is unconstitutional. The BJP wants to create divisiveness in this country in the name of temples and mosques,” he said.He also urged the government to consider the 10 amendments he proposed during the debate, warning that the Bill would curtail Muslim rights.The Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to revise the Waqf Act, 1995, which governs religious endowments under Islamic law in India. It defines the roles of Waqf Boards, Tribunals, and administrative structures overseeing waqf properties. While the government says the amendments are aimed at better regulation and transparency, critics argue the bill introduces state interference not applied to other religious institutions and undermines community autonomy.","Aimim chief asaduddin owaisi joins congress mp mohammad jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.

Despite a strong US jobs report, panic selling swept Wall Street and Europe, as investors braced for what many now see as an economic reckoning.The S&P 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since the pandemic crash in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,656 points, or 4.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 5.5%. Crude oil prices sank to 2021 levels, and industrial metals like copper dropped on worries of slowing global growth.The sell-off accelerated after China announced it would match President Donald Trump’s 34% tariff hike on Chinese imports with its own 34% tariffs on all US goods, effective April 10. The tit-for-tat escalation comes just a day after Trump warned Americans might feel “some pain” from his trade strategy, comparing the economic disruption to surgery.“For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.The US jobs report provided a brief pause to the carnage. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, reinforcing hopes that the US economy remains resilient. But analysts warned the data is backward-looking and does little to address forward risks.“Markets are now focused on what comes next. This is no longer about how strong the US was—it’s about whether it can withstand a trade war-induced slowdown,” said Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock.Some of the sharpest losses were among US companies exposed to China. DuPont fell nearly 17% after China’s regulators launched an anti-trust probe into its Chinese subsidiary. GE Healthcare, which gets 14% of its revenue from China, sank 13.3%. United Airlines, heavily reliant on Asia-Pacific routes, dropped 12.6%.On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump dismissed China’s move: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”Bond markets also flashed red.

Germany’s DAX index fell 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 lost 4.6%, and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8%.Vietnam and the European Union have both signaled intentions to negotiate with the US, but for now, the world’s two largest economies remain locked in economic combat — and markets are running scared.","The s&p 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since 2020.

Asteroid 2024 YR4's growing threat to the Moon



James Webb Space Telescope confirms near-zero threat from asteroid 2024 YR4



Impacts of asteroid on the Moon



Ongoing monitoring of asteroid 2024 YR4



Also Read |

The asteroid 2024 YR4 , once dreaded to be a ""city-killer,"" is not now regarded as a major menace to Earth anymore. Although the possibility of it colliding with our planet is reduced significantly now, recent findings indicate a probability of a meager chance to collide with the Moon in the near future.2024 YR4, which was found in December of 2024, was first a cause of concern because it was quite large, almost the size of a football field. When it was found, NASA 's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies placed a 3% chance that the asteroid might hit Earth in 2032. This probability was soon scaled down to much lower odds, 0.28%, in a matter of weeks after detection.In spite of the reduced chances of an Earth impact, asteroid 2024 YR4 has created fresh fears of a collision with the Moon. The asteroid, according to astronomer Andrew Rivkin, as seen by New Scientist, now has a 2% chance of hitting the Moon on December 22, 2032. This is marginally greater than the 1.7% chance previously estimated by NASA in February.Although the danger is still small, the potential for a lunar collision remains at the forefront of scientists' minds. NASA initially reported the 1.7% risk earlier this year, but continuous observations and calculations have indicated a marginal increase in the chances of impact with the Moon.As research and observation went on, the James Webb Space Telescope was instrumental in further tracking the asteroid. In late March, observations by the Webb telescope assured that the asteroid 2024 YR4 now poses a near-zero threat to Earth. The information gathered by this powerful observatory further reinforced the conclusion that the asteroid will not impact our planet in the near future.The James Webb Space Telescope will be observing 2024 YR4 once more in May 2025. The capabilities of the telescope are unmatched, and it can observe faint and distant objects within the universe. It gives wonderful data to NASA and foreign space agencies. This constant observation will still sharpen our knowledge of the course of the asteroid, especially as it travels toward the outer solar system.Although the possibility of collision with Earth is low, the impact on theMoon is not yet known. NASA suggests that asteroid impacts have, over billions of years, sculpted the surface of the Moon, producing craters and leaving an everlasting impression on the landscape. The American Museum of Natural History is adamant that impacts like these occurred far more commonly in the far past but now become very rare with time and, therefore, give rise to a ""relatively peaceful present.""The specific impact of an encounter with an asteroid of 2024 YR4's diameter is unknown. Earlier assessments have indicated that an impact on Earth would have ""truly catastrophic"" implications, though the impact would be localized, not inducing global climate shifts. Still, it would be an event of unimaginable scale, one that would bring widespread devastation in the local region of impact.Though tiny risks are present, researchers and space agencies are still tracking the path of 2024 YR4 closely. Though the chances of an impact on Earth have been virtually ruled out, the remote possibility of a collision with the Moon is a reminder of the need for continued caution in observing and monitoring near-Earth objects. As technology continues to evolve and we learn more about these cosmic dangers, the hope is that we can guarantee a peaceful future, untroubled by devastating asteroid impacts.","Asteroid 2024 yr4 now has a 2% chance of hitting the moon on december 22, 2032.

Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral — but is it real,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/donald-trumps-death-prediction-on-april-12-in-the-simpsons-is-going-viral-but-is-it-real/articleshow/119979161.cms,"Donald Trump’s 'death prediction' on April 12 in The Simpsons is going viral

Did The Simpsons predict Donald Trump’s death? The truth behind the viral video

Viral Trump coffin scene from The Simpsons is AI-generated, not real

Similar incidents in the past

Why these fake predictions gain traction

Official response and fact-checking

In the digital age, viral videos and AI-generated content can blur the lines between fact and fiction. One of the latest topics gaining traction online involves a claim that the popular animated show The Simpsons predicted the death of former U.S. President Donald Trump on April 12, 2025. The video, shared across social media platforms, shows what appears to be a scene from the show depicting a Trump-like figure in a coffin surrounded by mourners—prompting many to speculate whether The Simpsons has once again made an eerily accurate prophecy.The popularity of The Simpsons and its history of making surprisingly accurate predictions—such as Donald Trump's presidency or the invention of smartwatches—have fueled the intrigue. However, as with many viral claims, it's important to examine the facts behind the video, verify its source, and understand whether there is any truth to the speculation.The video making the rounds claims to be a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump-like character lying in a coffin. The setting is somber, with political figures surrounding the casket, and the voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The timestamp and content are intended to reinforce the idea that the show predicted his death years in advance.Adding to the credibility for some viewers is The Simpsons’ reputation for making correct predictions about real-world events. However, this particular clip is not what it appears to be.According to Matt Selman, executive producer of The Simpsons, the specific scene shown in the viral clip never appeared in any episode of the series. In fact, there is no The Simpsons episode, old or recent, that features Donald Trump’s death or anything resembling the visuals used in the video.The image and footage in question have been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated. In some versions, the words “R.I.P Donald Trump 1946–2024” appear, a telltale sign of digital manipulation. These visuals have been widely circulated on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, often accompanied by sensational music and misleading captions designed to provoke emotional reactions and maximize engagement.This isn’t the first time fake content involving The Simpsons and Donald Trump has gone viral. Since at least 2017, manipulated clips and images have circulated purporting that the show foresaw Trump’s death. Many of these posts resurface following real-world events involving the former president.For instance, a similar fake image went viral following an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024, falsely claiming that The Simpsons had shown his death in a previous season. Like the latest viral video, that image was also debunked by fact-checkers and producers associated with the show.The Simpsons has gained notoriety for seemingly accurate predictions, including Trump’s presidency (Season 11, Episode 17: ""Bart to the Future""), the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and the invention of devices resembling modern smartwatches. These accurate predictions have contributed to a belief among some viewers that the series is prophetic.However, the vast majority of these coincidences are either exaggerated, misunderstood, or—like the Trump death scene—fabricated. The show's vast number of episodes and its satirical nature naturally lead to scenarios that may eventually resemble real-world events. But that does not validate manipulated images or support predictions not backed by actual episodes.There has been no official confirmation from Fox or the creators of The Simpsons supporting the authenticity of the viral clip. Executive producer Matt Selman’s statements clearly refute any suggestion that such a scene exists in the show’s extensive catalogue. Independent fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claim, confirming that the video is digitally altered and not taken from any legitimate The Simpsons content.","A viral video claims to show a scene from the simpsons showing a donald trump-like character lying in a coffin.

Are Trump's reciprocal tariffs bad for China? DeepSeek says...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/are-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-bad-for-china-deepseek-says-/articleshow/119981002.cms,"DeepSeek

DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’

China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system, and promoting the construction of an open world economy. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade, safeguard the interests of the nation and its people, and promote the healthy and stable development of the economy. China's development achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. No external factors can hinder China's progress and the improvement of its people's lives. China will continue to deepen reforms, expand openness, and work with other countries around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

DeepSeek’s reply to “retaliatory actions that China can take against Trump's tariffs?""

China has a range of policy tools and strategic options to respond to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., ensuring the protection of its national interests while maintaining stability in global trade. Possible measures include:

1. Reciprocal Tariffs on U.S. Goods

•⁠ ⁠China could impose *targeted tariffs* on key U.S. exports such as *agricultural products (soybeans, pork), aircraft, automobiles, and energy products*.

•⁠ ⁠This would pressure politically sensitive U.S. industries, influencing domestic sentiment in key electoral states.

2. Export Controls on Critical Materials

•⁠ ⁠China dominates global supply chains in *rare earth metals* (used in electronics, defense, and green tech).

•⁠ ⁠Restrictions on rare earth exports could disrupt U.S. manufacturing, similar to measures taken in past trade disputes.

3. Non-Tariff Barriers & Regulatory Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Stricter inspections* on U.S. imports (food safety, customs delays).

•⁠ ⁠*Anti-dumping & anti-subsidy investigations* against U.S. products.

•⁠ ⁠*Preferential treatment* for non-U.S. companies in government procurement.

4. Diversifying Trade Partners (Reducing U.S. Dependence)

•⁠ ⁠*Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America* through new agreements.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)* to deepen Asia-Pacific trade ties.

5. Currency & Financial Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Allowing the yuan to depreciate* to make Chinese exports more competitive.

•⁠ ⁠*Dumping U.S. Treasury bonds* (though this is a double-edged sword).

6. Legal & WTO Challenges

•⁠ ⁠*Filing complaints at the WTO* against U.S. tariffs, as done in previous trade wars.

•⁠ ⁠*Forming alliances with other affected countries* to jointly oppose U.S. protectionism.

7. Domestic Stimulus & Self-Reliance

•⁠ ⁠*Boosting domestic consumption* to offset export losses.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating tech independence* (e.g., semiconductor self-sufficiency via policies like ""Made in China 2025"").

Conclusion

China has a *strategic, multi-layered approach* to counter U.S. tariffs, combining retaliatory measures with long-term economic resilience strategies. The goal is not just short-term retaliation but also reducing dependency on the U.S. market while strengthening global alliances.

US President Donald Trump ’s recent tariff announcements have reignited concerns about a potential trade war, particularly with China. The new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on Chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors, with technology supply chains facing significant impact. The Trump administration justifies the tariffs as a means to safeguard American industries and rectify trade imbalances, but critics express concerns about rising consumer prices and global economic instability.We asked DeepSeek , China's biggest AI disrupter in recent times, about the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on the country, and the response was pretty neutral.When asked, “Are Tump’s reciprocal tariffs bad for China?”, DeepSeek highlighted a “mutually beneficial strategy”.On the question, “What China can do to reciprocate the reciprocal Tariffs announced by Donald Trump?”, DeepSeek replied highlighting that China possesses a diverse toolkit to counteract US tariffs, encompassing both retaliatory actions and long-term strategic adjustments aimed at protecting China's national interests and maintain global trade stability.It explained the response in 7 points. Here’s what DeepSeek said:Last year, China announced a ban on the export of key minerals to the US, a move that could significantly impact the US technology manufacturing sector. According to a Reuters report, China's export ban includes minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others.These minerals are essential components in a wide range of technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications (e.g., ammunition, nuclear weapons). Gallium and germanium are crucial for semiconductors, while germanium also plays a role in infrared technology, fiber optic cables, and solar cells.","Deepseek says ‘no external factors can hinder china's progress’ the new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors.

In a blunt message, US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday said Denmark must reckon with the reality that ""Greenlanders don't want to be a part of it.""""Denmark should focus on the fact that the Greenlanders don't want to be a part of Denmark,"" Rubio said following a Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. The remark adds a new edge to the ongoing diplomatic tension over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory rich in natural resources and strategically located in the Arctic.Rubio's comments come amid growing US interest in Greenland and rising concerns over potential Chinese influence in the region. He made it clear that while Washington respects Greenland's right to decide its own future, it will not allow the island to fall into China's economic orbit.""What we're not going to do is let China come in now and offer them a bunch of money, and become dependent on China,"" Rubio said, reiterating America's strategic concerns in the Arctic.Greenland, home to around 57,000 people, has long expressed a desire for independence. Polls show a significant majority support breaking away from Denmark, though there's little indication they would favor joining the United States instead.The tension was heightened last week when US Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland. Rubio defended the trip, saying it underscored the US position of respecting the island's self-determination. However, the visit was viewed as provocative by both Nuuk and Copenhagen .Despite the diplomatic friction, Rubio said he had reassured his Danish counterpart of the ""strong"" relationship between the two nations during a meeting on the sidelines of the Nato summit.","Us secretary of state marco rubio said denmark must reckon with the reality that ""greenlanders don't want to be a part of it"" the remark adds a new edge to the ongoing diplomatic tension over greenland.
