‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue





The White House on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India and is in frequent contact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as differences continue over trade tariffs and oil imports from Russia.WHite House also called the India-US partnership one that the President values “very strongly,”At a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship. A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Leavitt added that the US has ""a great Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor,"" and confirmed that Trump’s trade team is in “very serious discussions” with New Delhi. “I know the President has great respect for Prime Minister Modi and they speak pretty frequently,” she said.Her remarks come days after Trump claimed India had reduced its purchase of Russian oil, describing New Delhi as “very good” on the issue during his five-day Asia tour.Since mid-October, Trump has repeatedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would limit or stop crude imports from Moscow.Trump’s statements are linked to his administration’s efforts to isolate Russia economically through sanctions and energy restrictions amid the war in Ukraine.However, earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded to Trump’s comments, saying that the country’s energy sourcing decisions are driven by national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”He added that India’s energy policy aims to ensure stable prices and secure supplies through diversified sourcing. “Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement. This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” Jaiswal said.Ties between India and the US have come under strain after Washington imposed high trade tariffs on New Delhi in August. The US levied 50 per cent tariffs, including 25 per cent secondary duties, as a response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia.India criticised the move as “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while Trump described US-India trade ties as a “totally one-sided disaster.”","Us president donald trump remains committed to strengthening ties with india, white house says.

Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with patriotic and cultural events:The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday, the observance connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign nation.","Oman’s national day, from 20–21 november 2025, celebrates 1650 portuguese expulsion.

‘Growing anti-Hindu sentiment’: Indian-origin Congressman slams JD Vance over remarks about wife Usha’s faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/growing-anti-hindu-sentiment-indian-origin-congressman-slams-jd-vance-over-remarks-about-wife-ushas-faith/articleshow/125091769.cms,"JD Vance's Hindu Wife Usha To Convert After Vice President's Pitch? US Expert’s Big Reveal





US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi slammed vice president JD Vance for his recent comments about his wife’s Hindu background, saying they contribute to a growing atmosphere of prejudice and anti-Hindu sentiment in the United States.“At a time when Hindu and Indian-American communities are confronting a climate of rising prejudice, talk of mass deportations, and growing anti-Hindu sentiment even against members of his own party, it's deeply disappointing that the Vice President would add to that climate through his recent comments while remaining silent in the face of hate,” Krishnamoorthi said on X.Vance, who is married to Indian-American Usha Vance, made some controversial remarks during a public event at the University of Mississippi. Vance said he hoped Usha turned to Christianity and claimed that her Hindu background stems from ""not a particularly religious family.""Responding to a question about his interfaith marriage, he said, “Now, most Sundays, Usha will come with me to church. As I've told her, and as I've said publicly, and as I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends, do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.He added, “But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love.”Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, describing Usha’s background, saying, “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it's fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family, but not a particularly religious family in either direction.”His comments stirred a row. Canadian journalist Ezra Levant called them “disgusting” and accused Vance of disrespecting his wife’s faith. “It's weird to throw your wife's religion under the bus, in public, for a moment's acceptance by groypers,” Levant wrote on X.Vance fired back, saying critics were twisting his words and that he loves his wife with all his heart. “My wife is the most amazing blessing I have in my life,” he wrote. “She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert... I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her.”","Us congressman raja krishnamoorthi slammed vice president jd vance for his recent comments about his wife’s hindu background.

’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

JAMMU: A 22-year-old Agniveer attached to 11 Rashtriya Rifles was wounded Wednesday when a gunfight broke out between security forces and terrorists hiding in Kalaban forest of Kishtwar district in J&K, official sources said.The joint operation by Army and J&K police began after intelligence inputs pointed to the presence of terrorists in the area. Forces cordoned off the forest and launched a search, which quickly escalated into an exchange of fire.“As the cordon was tightened, the terrorists were located, leading to an exchange of fire. At least three terrorists are hiding there,” a source said, adding that Kapil Kumar of UP’s Fatehpur, recruited under the short-term Agnipath enlistment programme, was hit in the initial burst of gunfire. He was moved to the military hospital in Udhampur and is out of danger. The operation remained underway late Wednesday.Kishtwar has seen a surge in counterterrorism operations, with six gunfights reported over the past seven months as security forces track Pakistan-based terrorists in the hilly, forested terrain. On May 22, Army trooper Gaykar Sandip Pandurang, 32, was killed and two others were wounded in a clash with terrorists in Chatroo.Earlier, on April 11–12, three Jaish-e-Mohammed militants were gunned down in the same area.The district lies on a traditional infiltration route used by terrorists crossing the Pakistan border in Kathua before moving through Udhampur, Doda, and Kishtwar towards Kashmir valley.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change







NEW DELHI: Hours after holding the third of his “vote chori” press conferences, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday — on the eve of the first phase of polling in Bihar — once again appealed to “Gen Z” voters to help “save” India’s democracy - through truth and non-violence.""My young friends from Bihar, my Gen-Z brothers and sisters — tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future,” Gandhi said in a video posted on his X handle.“Many of you will be voting for the first time — this is not just your right, but democracy’s greatest responsibility. You’ve seen how in Haryana, a nefarious game of vote theft was played. In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh — everywhere, these people have tried to suppress the people’s voice. Now their eyes are on Bihar, on your votes, on your future,” he added, referring to states where he has alleged electoral manipulation.The Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition also urged young voters to turn out in large numbers and support the Mahagathbandhan candidate in their respective constituencies. The Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan is the opposition alliance in Bihar seeking to unseat the ruling National Democratic Alliance.The Congress is a Mahagathbandhan constituent.""Stay vigilant against every conspiracy, every manipulation at the booth - democracy's greatest strength is an aware public. Bihar's future is in your hands - Defeat this conspiracy of 'stealing votes and forming government this way.' Walk the path of truth and non-violence and save democracy with your vote, awaken Bihar,"" Gandhi said.Earlier, the Raebareli MP held a press conference at the Congress headquarters in Delhi, unveiling what he had been referring to as a “hydrogen bomb.” He alleged that the BJP had “stolen” Haryana from the Congress by adding 25 lakh fake voters in ""collusion"" with the Election Commission — a charge the poll body dismissed, as it had on the previous two occasions.The grand old party had “refused” to accept the results of the Haryana assembly elections, held in October last year.The first phase of polling in Bihar will cover 121 assembly constituencies, while the remaining 122 seats will go to the polls in the second and final phase on November 11. Counting of votes for both rounds is scheduled for November 14.“Gen Z” is a reference to the wave of youth-led movements that have toppled governments in several of India’s neighbouring countries — most recently in Nepal, following similar uprisings in Bangladesh in 2024 and Sri Lanka in 2022. Similar protests have also been witnessed in other nations.","Rahul gandhi urges young voters to turn out in large numbers and support the mahagathbandhan candidate.

Gold Card versus EB-5





EB-5's rising momentum





MUMBAI: With a waiting queue running into several decades for an employment-linked Green Card, a growing number of Indians continue to resort to a faster way to live permanently in the US.The investment-linked Green Card program (EB-5) comes in handy for those H-1Bs who can afford it-despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted Green Card. The EB-5 program also finds favour among high networth individuals (HNIs) in India, who are looking at securing their children's future in America. Investors initially obtain a conditional Green Card, which is later converted into a permanent Green Card. (See table).Applicants are required to invest $800,000 (about Rs 7.1 crore) or $1,050,000 (about Rs 9.3 crore), depending on the project's type and/or location, and must create or preserve at least 10 full-time American jobs. Most investors route their funds through regional centers (USCIS-designated entities) that pool EB-5 capital into large-scale projects. Over 90% of EB-5 investments in recent years have been made through these centers rather than via direct investments.Soon after being sworn in as US president, Donald Trump announced he would launch a 'Gold Card'; commerce secretary Howard Lutnick added this could replace the EB-5 program with Gold-Card funds going directly to the US govt. This led to jitters among the EB-5 investors and those aspiring for a Green Card under this investment-linked route.On Sept 19, Trump signed an executive order to introduce the 'Gold Card' visa program. Individuals wishing to qualify for Gold Card must make an unrestricted gift of $1 million (about Rs 8.4 crore) to US Department of Commerce. If a corporation or similar entity makes the gift on behalf of the individual, the required amount rises to $2 million (about Rs 16.8 crore).The modalities of the Gold Card are yet to be rolled out. A key difference between the two programs lies not just in the amounts to be paid, but the fact that the Gold Card entails a 'fee', whereas the EB-5 program requires an 'investment'-with a return on capital.As things stand, the long-term future of the EB-5 program remains unclear. Immigration attorneys point out that the EB-5 Regional Center (RC) Program has been reauthorised until 2027 by the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) of 2022. Those who have invested, or plan to invest, before Sept 2026 will be protected from future lapses in the program owing to the RIA's grandfathering clause. The clause seems to have eased initial jitters among aspiring investors. Many of India's high networth families are turning to this path to secure long-term US residency for their kids. Mid-career professionals already in the US on H-1B visas -where Green Card backlogs stretch to decades-are increasingly joining them.According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, the EB-5 program drew $4.1 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025- nearly matching investment for the entire previous year.Since the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act (RIA) came into effect in 2022, around 1,050- 1,150 Indians have filed EB-5 applications, according to USCIS filing data. This places India as the second-largest EB-5 applicant group globally, accounting for roughly 20- 22% of all new post-RIA filings. The demand has remained consistent month-to-month, driven by both H-1B families already in the US facing decades-long Green Card wait times and by high networth families in India planning long-term residency and education pathways for their children.""Most people still believe that once their child gets into a decent US university, they can build a career there,"" said Piyush Gupta, vice-president of CanAm Enterprises, which operates several licensed regional centers. However, uncertainties arising out of ever-changing and tightening H-1B policies prompts many to explore EB-5, he added.For Prahlad Purohit, a 43-year-old Google engineer from Mumbai, the decision was driven by family rather than finance. After nearly a decade in the US, he feared his two India-born children would lose their dependent status when they turned 21. ""My son couldn't even apply for internships because he wasn't a resident,"" Purohit said over a call from San Francisco. ""Both my children grew up here, they don't know the system in India. That's when I chose EB-5.""Speaking to TOI on a Zoom from Mountview, California, he recalls how he selected his investment. ""It's like the Wild West, with many claiming they're the best and promising exorbitant returns on top of the Green Card-from almond farms to hotel chains,"" he said. ""I finally chose a real estate development in Manhattan that was building a corporate skyscraper.""Despite its high approval rate, the EB-5 route remains a risky mix of financial investment, immigration strategy, and trust in the US market. As Gupta put it, ""For many of our clients, this isn't about returns-it's about certainty. They'd rather invest in a project than a house, if it means their family never has to rely on H-1B visa lottery again.""","The investment-linked green card program (eb-5) comes in handy for those h-1bs who can afford it. Despite the significant investment involved, a wait-time of a few years compares favourably with an endless wait for the coveted green card.

The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that it will cut the scheduled capacity for flights by 10% at 40 “high-volume” markets across the US from Friday morning as the federal government grapples with an ongoing historic shutdown.Secretary of transportation Sean Duffy and federal aviation administration boss Bryan Bedford announced the decision on Wednesday afternoon.The change will affect commercial, private and even space flight and could ground as many as 4,000 flights nationwide. Duffy and Bedford did not yet reveal which airports would be affected, New York Post reported.The shutdown, which became the longest-ever on Wednesday, exacerbated an existing shortage of air traffic controllers who have been unpaid since the start of the shutdown on October 1.“This is proactive,” Duffy explained during a press conference.“We are seeing pressures build in a way that if we allow it to go unchecked, will not allow us to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world. And we are not going to react to that. We intend to be proactive,” Bedford added.October 28 marked the first scheduled paycheck that air traffic controllers did not receive. Duffy noted they were allotted a partial payment in early October.“Our air traffic controllers and a lot of those at DOT and throughout the government, they haven’t received paychecks. And many of these employees, they’re the head of household,” he said.“They have their spouse at home, they have a child or two or three, and when they lose income, they’re confronted with real-world difficulties in how they pay their bills.”Duffy explained that some have resorted to taking “side jobs” to make up the monumental losses brought on by the shutdown.Since the shutdown started, entire air traffic control towers went unmanned during operating hours as airports struggled to fill schedules with willing workers. Others were plagued by endless delays, which officials said would only get worse as the shutdown entered its second month.New York area airports were not spared. Last week, two planes collided on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport amid ever-growing delays for antsy travellers inside, with many stretching beyond two hours.Orlando International Airport, which is at the heart of Florida’s major amusement parks, neared total closure as it repeatedly came close to cancelling all landings.The FAA attributed many of the snares to growing staffing shortages.Duffy said that the agency “figured 10%” was an appropriate number “based on the pressure we were seeing.”“We do not want to see disruptions at the FAA or here at the DOT, but our number one priority is to make sure when you travel, you travel safely,” Duffy said.Bedford assured that the cuts would not affect air safety but would give overworked controllers some relief.Meanwhile, it could take years for the air traffic controller shortage to be addressed, and the shutdown only ground the process to a halt.“It takes years to bring more well-trained certified controllers into the airspace. The shutdown is having an impact on our ability to maintain those numbers and dent that and dent that … shortage that we have,” Duffy said.Duffy previously warned that the Trump administration may close parts of US airspace if the shutdown continued into next week, which would only spur more flight delays and cancellations.","The change will affect commercial, private and even space flight and could ground as many as 4,000 flights nationwide. The shutdown has exacerbated an existing shortage of air traffic controllers who have been unpaid since the start of the shutdown on october 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125120223,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-8272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Man vs wild: Japan deploys military to combat deadly bear attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/man-vs-wild-japan-deploys-military-to-combat-deadly-bear-attack-why-climate-change-could-be-the-reason/articleshow/125113698.cms,"Bear attack in Japan (agencies)





Japan has mobilised its military in the country’s mountainous north as communities grapple with a surge in bear attacks, with local authorities pointing to shifting food patterns driven by climate change as a possible factor. The self-defense forces (SDF) were deployed Wednesday to Kazuno, a small town in Akita Prefecture, after officials warned that residents faced daily threats from bears foraging near homes.According to Japan’s ministry of the environment, more than 100 bear attacks have been reported since April, leaving a record 12 people dead. Two-thirds of these fatalities occurred in Akita and nearby Iwate Prefecture. Bear sightings in Akita have risen six-fold this year, reaching over 8,000, prompting the prefectural governor to request military assistance.In Kazuno, soldiers arrived in trucks and jeeps, equipped with body armour and large maps, to help transport, set, and inspect steel-barred traps. Trained hunters will carry out the culling. Mayor Shinji Sasamoto said, “The townspeople feel the danger every day… It has affected how people live their lives, forcing them to stop going out or cancel events.”Experts point to a combination of factors behind the surge.Rising bear populations, climate change-induced shortages of natural forest food, and rural depopulation have all contributed to increased human-bear encounters.“Last year there was an abundance of food in the mountains, and many cubs were born. This year, the food supply has run out,” said Yasuhiro Kitakata, head of Kazuno’s bear department.Recent attacks have occurred in unusual places: customers inside a supermarket were assaulted, a tourist was jumped at a bus stop near a UNESCO world heritage site, and a hot spring resort worker was injured. Schools in affected areas have temporarily closed as a precaution. Bear attacks typically peak in October and November, as animals forage intensively ahead of winter hibernation.The SDF operation in Kazuno, a town of roughly 30,000 known for its hot springs and apple orchards, will continue through November and expand to Odate and Kitaakita. Tokyo is also planning a broader emergency package, including recruiting more licensed hunters and relaxing gun rules to make it easier to control bear populations in urban areas. Deputy chief cabinet secretary Kei Sato said, “As bears continue to enter populated areas in many regions and injuries from bear attacks increase daily, we absolutely cannot afford to put off bear countermeasures. ”Analysts warn that climate change may make such incidents more frequent, as rising temperatures and shifting seasonal food patterns push wildlife closer to human settlements. Japan’s unusual military deployment highlights the growing challenge of coexisting with wildlife in an era of environmental change.","Japan has mobilised its military in the country’s mountainous north as communities grapple with a surge in bear attacks.

“I don’t have any interest…”: Joe Alwyn’s old comments about Taylor Swift resurfaces and fans claim Travis Kelce is the total opposite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-dont-have-any-interest-joe-alwyns-old-comments-about-taylor-swift-resurfaces-and-fans-claim-travis-kelce-is-the-total-opposite/articleshow/124992561.cms,"Taylor Swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with Joe Alwyn to a public spectacle with Travis Kelce. While Alwyn offered quiet devotion, Kelce brings an open, expressive joy. Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering”

From Joe Alwyn’s quiet loyalty to Travis Kelce’s bold devotion





Before Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce captured the world’s attention, the singer experienced a very different kind of love with British actor Joe Alwyn . Their six-year relationship was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion, a stark contrast to the spotlight-fueled excitement surrounding her current relationship.Joe Alwyn’s composed attitude toward fame and his ability to protect their bond from media noise once defined Swift’s most peaceful chapter. Now, years later, Swift appears to have found joy in a more open and expressive love with Kelce. From game-day appearances to public displays of affection, she seems more confident and carefree than ever, embracing happiness on her own terms while rewriting what love looks like in her world. ..In a 2019 interview with The Sunday Times, Hollywood actor Joe Alwyn was asked about the experience of having some of pop sensation Taylor Swift’s biggest love songs inspired by him. His response was characteristically grounded and gentle. “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” he said with a calm smile..At the time, Taylor Swift had just released Lover, an album filled with romantic anthems like “London Boy” and “Cornelia Street”, both widely believed to be about Alwyn.Even on her previous record Reputation, songs such as “Call It What You Want” and “King of My Heart” hinted at their growing bond. Swift once described that era as one of emotional safety, telling fans she had found “stability” away from chaos.What made Joe Alwyn stand out during their six-year relationship was his ability to tune out the noise. He told The Times he simply ignored media speculation: “I don’t have any interest in tabloids. I know what I want to do, and that’s this, and that’s what I am doing.”Taylor Swift echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Guardian, explaining, “I’ve learned that if I do [discuss my relationship], people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”Today, as Swift navigates a far more public love story with Travis Kelce, one often unfolding under stadium lights and social media frenzy, some fans can’t help but look back at her time with Alwyn as the quiet before the storm.However, Taylor Swift has never looked happier than she does with Travis Kelce. Friends close to the couple say she’s “glowing” and genuinely enjoying a new sense of freedom she didn’t always have in past relationships. Unlike her quieter years with Joe Alwyn, Swift seems to thrive in this more public love story, cheering from VIP boxes, holding hands after games, and embracing the spotlight with confidence.Those close to her note that Kelce’s openness and playful energy have brought out her fun, carefree side, describing their bond as “easy, supportive, and real.” For Swift, this chapter feels less like hiding from fame and more like finally living out loud, on her own terms.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials Earlier in 2024, insiders told People that Joe Alwyn had turned the page on his relationship with Taylor Swift and begun seeing someone new. The sources added that the actor was content with where he was in life, balancing a healthy personal life with a strong professional focus. They also noted that Alwyn has always spoken respectfully about Swift, acknowledging that while he deeply cared for her, their relationship simply ran its course.","Taylor swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with joe alwyn to a public spectacle with travis kelce.

"Gisele Bündchen implied that prioritizing Tom Brady for years took a personal toll: “When you love someone, you don’t put them in jail”",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-implied-that-prioritizing-tom-brady-for-years-took-a-personal-toll-when-you-love-someone-you-dont-put-them-in-jail/articleshow/125033119.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen, in a candid interview, shared insights into her marriage with Tom Brady, describing their split as a 'death and rebirth.' She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Her message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel gisele bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former nfl quarterback tom brady.

Mizkif Files Federal Lawsuit Following Emiru’s Abuse Accusations





Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo, one of Twitch’s most well-known streamers and a founding member of the OTK content group, has filed a federal lawsuit that’s now shaking the online entertainment world. On November 4, Mizkif formally sued his ex-girlfriend Emily “Emiru” Schunk, fellow streamer Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, and several associated companies, like OTK Media Inc., Mythic Talent Management Inc., and King Gaming Labs Inc., alleging defamation and reputational harm after a wave of abuse accusations surfaced online.The lawsuit follows Emiru’s October 25 Twitch stream, where she accused Mizkif of sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse. According to the lawsuit filed in federal court, Mizkif argues that these allegations were false and have inflicted “significant harm to his reputation and career.” Mizkif is seeking damages for lost earnings, emotional distress, and reputational damage, marking one of the most public and complex legal battles yet to hit Twitch’s tight-knit creator community.After Emiru’s recent Twitch stream detailed her relationship with Mizkif, she described several incidents that left her feeling physically and emotionally uncomfortable.Emiru claimed Mizkif tried to control who she spent time with and continued contacting her after their breakup.Her statements, which included allegations of sexual harassment and distress, sent shockwaves through the streaming community and quickly went viral across platforms.In his own response stream, Mizkif admitted to acting “inappropriately” and being “controlling,” but countered that Emiru had also been violent.He denied the extent of her allegations, accusing her of mistreating her pets and misrepresenting their relationship.Despite his response, most of the streaming community sided with Emiru. Prominent streamers, including Asmongold, publicly condemned Mizkif’s behavior, intensifying the fallout that ultimately led to his dismissal from OTK Media.In his lawsuit, Mizkif accuses Emiru, Asmongold, and OTK of working “in concert” to falsely accuse him of serious criminal activity to damage his standing and seize control of the ventures he helped establish.The legal document emphasizes that none of the organizations involved, including OTK, Mythic Talent, or King Gaming Labs, sought his comment before cutting ties.Additionally, the lawsuit disputes claims that Mizkif owes nearly $896,401.92 in fees to Mythic Talent and King Gaming Labs, asserting that these contractual breach allegations are baseless.Mizkif seeks compensation for “reputational harm, lost earnings, and emotional distress.” He also accuses OTK Media of wrongful termination and reclaiming over one million shares of company stock after Emiru’s allegations became public.According to Mizkif, these actions caused significant financial losses and emotional distress, particularly given OTK’s public statement that cited “threats of personal and professional harm” toward Emiru.Neither Emiru nor Mizkif has publicly commented since their last respective broadcasts, and Asmongold has not addressed the suit.","Mizkif sues ex emiru and asmongold after abuse allegations damage his twitch career.

Trump vs Mamdani





US President Donald Trump 's political foe Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday won the New York City mayoral election, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.34-year-old Mamdani will be New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor. He will replace Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his re-election bid in September but remained on the ballot.A state assembly member from Queens, Mamdani had entered the contest a year ago as little more than a protest candidate with a thin résumé and virtually no citywide profile.Turnout surged past 2 million voters, the highest level of participation in one of the city's mayoral elections since 1969.Meanwhile, Trump shrugged off Mamdani's victory claiming that US government shutdown was one of the reasons why Republicans lost the polls.Citing pollsters, Trump said ,""Trump wasn’t on the ballot, and shutdown, were the two reasons that Republicans lost elections tonight.""The municipal election turned into a direct fight between Trump and Mamdani. Trump has repeatedly referred to Mamdani as a “Communist lunatic” and a “disaster waiting to happen.” Mamdani, for his part, told The Good Liars in a recent interview that he would “work with the president for the sake of New Yorkers” but “not be cowed.”“If you want to make life more difficult for New Yorkers,” he said, “then I’ll be there to fight you. ”Trump also urged voters to back Cuomo to block Mamdani’s victory. “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump wrote. “You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job.” He warned that if Mamdani wins, federal funds to New York could be at risk.Trump also said that he will cut federal funding to New York if Mamdani wins the election. He also endorsed former New York State governor Andrew Cuomo for the top city post.""If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!"" Trump wrote in a post.New York City, spanning Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island — is home to over 8 million people and stands as one of the world’s most influential urban centres. Its cultural and economic reach extends far beyond the United States, making it a global capital of finance, technology, and the arts.The mayor’s role is therefore of immense importance. With an annual budget of around $116 billion, the mayor oversees services from policing to education in a city visited by 65 million people a year.The position carries both domestic and global weight, with previous mayors using it as a platform for presidential ambitions.The city also leads in artificial intelligence, hosting over 2,000 AI startups and a skilled workforce of 40,000.","34-year-old mamdani will be new york city's youngest and first muslim mayor.

Why Jason Kelce prefers fried turkey and the traditions he’s trying to start

Retirement hasn’t slowed Jason Kelce down one bit — at least not when it comes to family life. As Thanksgiving draws near, the former Philadelphia Eagles center is swapping playbooks for recipes and family traditions. The six-time Pro Bowler, in a chat with PEOPLE, said that he’s ready for another round of holiday chaos with wife Kylie and their growing crew.Kelce, 37, might be a force on the field, but when it comes to Thanksgiving prep, he’s happy to admit he’s not calling the plays in the kitchen. “For Thanksgiving, Kylie and her mom do the majority of the cooking. [My] mom comes over, she does her dinner rolls that she's made since we were kids, and then the past couple years, I've been frying a turkey,” he says.Turns out, though, Jason Kelce isn’t exactly a fan of the holiday’s main event. As he explained it, turkey just doesn’t do much for him. “I don't like turkey that much. The only time I really have ever had like a turkey is when I've seen it fried, probably [due to the] the moisture content in it,” he said. “I've never grilled a turkey, I've had turkey smoked. I've had turkey out of the oven, and I've done a fried turkey — smoked isn't bad, especially if it's like a spatchcocked Turkey.He added, “I like the fried turkey for sure, that's one bird that does better that way.”Still, the New Heights co-host isn’t just thinking about what’s on the table. With three daughters — Wyatt, 6, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2 — and baby Finn, 6 months, Kelce is focused on building family moments that we would cherish. “One of the traditions we started is my mom has been passing new [Christmas] ornaments on. So like, going out, cutting down the Christmas tree and putting it up and putting the ornaments on the tree. I'm trying to turn that into a tradition where we do that as close to Thanksgiving as possible,” he explained. “We haven't accomplished that yet. I would love to cut down the tree, have Thanksgiving, and then the next day, the tree is being put up and decorated. That's what I want to do. We haven't done it yet.”Last year Kelce and his family spent Thanksgiving in Nashville with his brother, Travis Kelce , and Travis’s now-fiancée, popstar Taylor Swift . A source at the time told PEOPLE, “Taylor and her family were excited to host the Kelces this year. Jason was there with his family and kids too.

Indian origin Democrat Ghazala Hashmi elected Lt governor







Democrat Abigail Spanberger has become the governor of Virginia, making history as the first woman to lead the state after reclaiming the governor’s mansion from Republicans on Tuesday.The former congresswoman and ex-CIA officer defeated Virginia’s Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, as reported by CBS News.The Virginia race drew national attention, seen by many as a referendum on US President Donald Trump. While Trump made significant gains in the state during the 2020 election, his new term has brought economic strain for many Virginians.Virginia has trended more Democratic in recent years, fueled by growth in Washington, DC’s suburbs. However, Democrats lost some ground last year as Trump increased his statewide vote share from 44 percent in 2020 to 46.1 percent in 2024.Spanberger focused on the economic fallout from Trump’s federal spending cuts, which hurt jobs in Virginia, and campaigned on making life more affordable.In the final weeks, Spanberger campaigned alongside prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Earle-Sears leaned on the backing of outgoing Republican governor Glenn Youngkin, promoting his economic record throughout her campaign.However, the Republican candidate did not receive a direct endorsement from Trump, despite his “complete and total endorsement” of GOP nominees in Virginia’s attorney general race and New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.Trump expressed some support for Earle-Sears, though he did not mention her by name.Northern Virginia, home to many federal workers, has been hit by workforce cuts and the government shutdown.Virginia was one of two states, along with New Jersey, voting for governor on Tuesday. Voters also chose a new mayor in New York City, while Californians decided on a new congressional map aimed at helping Democrats gain up to five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections, as reported by AP.Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won Virginia’s lieutenant governor race on Tuesday, defeating Republican John Reid. She becomes the first Indian American and the first Muslim to hold statewide office in Virginia.Hashmi currently serves as a state senator representing a district south of Richmond. Before entering politics, she was a college professor in Virginia.She began her political career in 2019 by winning a Republican-held state Senate seat and later secured victory in a crowded Democratic primary for lieutenant governor in June, as reported by AP.","Abigail spanberger defeated republican winsome earle-sears to become the first woman governor of virginia.

More coverage on NFL WAGs:

Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios’ girlfriend, Alix Earle, turned up the heat and captivated the crowd at the 2025 LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) Art+Film Gala over the weekend with her chic black strapless dress. She wore a black, floor-length gown with a form-fitting silhouette that hugged her frame. The dress featured a strapless sweetheart neckline and a structured bodice with a small keyhole cutout at the center. The bodice’s textured design, beaded or braided, created a sculptural, swirling pattern across the bust. The remainder of her dress flowed from luxurious black velvet, reminiscent of midnight, absorbing the ambient lights of the gala. She left her blonde, wavy hair open. Her face was adorned with light coral lipstick, heavy upper eyelashes, and evenly toned light makeup. Earle shared a series of snapshots on her Instagram from the annual fundraising event, captioned “@lacma Art & Film Gala,” followed by four black hearts. She looked radiant, exuding a magnetic presence deserving of worldwide praise. One admirer in particular, former LSU Tigers’ star gymnast Olivia “Livvy” Dunne, unexpectedly echoed this sentiment on the NFL WAG’s IG post: “Simply stunning.”The first snapshot featured a dreamy-posed Alix Earle in her stunning black strapless dress, set against the backdrop of castle pillars. Next, she stood tall, the camera catching the daring slit of her gown. The third image displayed scenes from the LACMA Art+Film Gala, likely from, since director Ryan Coogler was honored at the event. The fourth image was a selfie of the social media influencer in a fish gape pose.The fifth photo teased a plate of what supposedly looked like either fried chicken nuggets or the famed caviar and nuggets from COQODAQ, a Korean fried chicken restaurant in New York City. The sixth image showed Earle on a bed, looking away from the camera and seemingly lost in thought, yet radiating confidence in her bold dress.
