Obviously, what happened—if I can sum up the statement—is that we are concerned about the developments, but we would really urge all the parties involved to now sit down and come to a position which is in the interest of the well-being and safety of the people of Venezuela, because at the end of the day, that is our concern,” Jaishankar said.“We would want Venezuela as a country with whom, over many, many years, we’ve had very good relations. So we would like the people to come out well, whatever the direction of events,” he added.This comes after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country on Saturday in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.Subsequently, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,” it added.","Jaishankar urged all parties involved in the crisis to sit down and reach a position that serves the well-being of the people of venezuela.

NEW DELHI: Linking the mounting trade tensions between India and United States with the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in the CIA-led operation, Maharashtra's former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday asked: ""Will Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?""Chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the US President Donald Trump's 50 percent tariff on India.""With a 50 percent tariff, trade is simply not possible. In effect, this amounts to blocking India–US trade, especially exports from India to the United States. Since a direct ban cannot be imposed, tariffs have been used as a tool to stop trade. India will have to bear this,"" Chavan said in an interview to news agency IANS.He further said: ""The profits that our people earlier earned from exports to the US will no longer be available. We will have to look for alternative markets, and efforts in that direction are already under way"".""The question then is: What next? Will something like what happened in Venezuela happen in India? Will Mr. Trump kidnap our Prime Minister?"" Chavan asked.Criticising Chavan over his remark, BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: Congress sinks to a new low every day. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan shamelessly comparing India’s situation with Venezuela. By asking whether “what happened in Venezuela can happen in India”, Congress is making its anti-India mindset clear. Rahul Gandhi wants chaos in Bharat. Rahul Gandhi is seeking foreign intervention in Bharat’s affairs!""Earlier in the day, Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.However, the ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense after the US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.Trump on Monday issued a fresh tariff warning to India, saying Washington could raise duties on New Delhi if it does not “help on Russian oil issue,” directly linking the threat to the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war.“We could raise tariffs on India if they don't have help on Russian oil issue,” said US President Trump, quoted by Reuters.US President Donald Trump added, ""They wanted to make me happy, basically... PM Modi's a very good man. He's a good guy. He knew I was not happy. It was important to make me happy. They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly...""Trump was referring to India’s continued oil trade with Russia, a point his administration has repeatedly opposed, and which he had cited as the basis for doubling tariffs on India to 50% in August 2025.India is already facing the 50% tariff imposed by Trump, who has been sharply critical of New Delhi’s ties with Moscow and has alleged India of strengthening Russia in the Ukraine war by purchasing Russian crude.",Prithviraj chavan said the central government has been making an effort to diversify the supply source to give a cushion to the exporters hit by the us president donald trump's 50 percent tariff on india.

Snow, orchards, birds



-- the timeless line, attributed by many to Amir Khusrau and famously used by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, resurfaces each winter as Kashmir enters its harshest yet most enchanting period -- Chillai Kalan. And as the Valley embraces this 40-day stretch of biting cold, this Persian phrase feels more fitting.Snow-laden rooftops of the houses, frost-crusted deodar and chinar trees, Kashmiris in pherans with smoky kangris tucked insde, the Valley transforms into a scenic postcard during Chillai Kalan. Srinagar 's Jewel -- Dal Lake freezes around the edges, its shikaras scraping gently through thin sheets of ice, while cracks form over the vast span of Wular Lake in Bandipora. Migratory birds flee frostbitten homelands in Siberia, China, and Central Asia, to find refuge in Kashmir's wetlands, adding life to its winter quiet.As 2026 begins, the grandeur of the Kashmir Valley is in the grip of Chillaii-Kalan, a 40-day spell of the harshest, and the most defining phase of winter, the region experiences each year.Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: Chillai Kalan, Chillai Khurd, and Chillai Bachha.It begins with the 40-day Chillai Kalan (December 21–January 31), the harshest period of cold. This is followed by the 20-day Chillai Khurd (January 31–February 19), or ""small cold,"" and concludes with the 10-day Chillai Bachha (February 20–March 2), or ""baby cold.""Each phase brings biting temperatures, snowfall, and frozen rivers and lakes, playing a vital role in replenishing the Valley’s water resources.The Valley takes on a new dimension of beauty under a pristine blanket of snow, with green meadows, apple orchards, and winding highways to the upper reaches of the Great Himalayas and Pir Panjal range all dusted in white.Kashmir, already one of the world's most sought-after tourist destinations, becomes even more captivating during this period. Travel enthusiasts flock to witness fresh snowfall, feel the intense winter chill, and listen to the rustle of icy winds whipping through the mountains, adding a dramatic rhythm to the serene landscape.Winter is traditionally Kashmir's most dramatic season, but this year, the Valley is witnessing a remarkable inflow of visitors. Gulmarg has been reporting almost 100% occupancy, with the Tourism Department lining up events across Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Pahalgam and Dodhpathri to meet demand.Hotels across Srinagar, Pahalgam and Gulmarg are filled for the first time in months.Altaf Ahmad, a hotel general manager in Gulmarg, told IANS: ""We are completely sold out this time.""For many locals, this winter is not just a season but the opening of opportunities to earn livelihood as Kashmir sees heavy footfall of tourists during this time.A resort owner in Pahalgam, Taufique Butt, reflects on Chillai Kalan and describes it in Kashmiri.His resort, like others in the scenic town of Pahalgam and on the banks of Lidder River, has no vacant rooms left.""Sir, the situation here is quite overwhelming. Tourists from all over India are coming to see the snow… All our hotels, resorts, and lodges are overbooked. People are arriving with online pre-bookings.""The scars of last April's terror attack in Baisaran briefly dented the tourist flow, he said, especially around Pahalgam. But Aru, Betaab and Chandanwari — the ABC of Pahalgam, which are key destinations soon triggered visitors returning in large numbers.Fresh snowfall after the New Year renewed excitement, particularly at Aru and Betaab Valley, known to many as the filming sites of Bajrangi Bhaijaan.Ujjwal Kant, visiting from Sonepur in Bihar, had just returned from skiing and gondola rides in Gulmarg when he described the mystical mornings of Chillai Kalan:He added: ""I actually came hoping to experience Chillai Kalan, and it's been unforgettable… frozen streams, quiet valleys, and almost postcard-like mornings. We had to modify our plans a bit because roads open late and highways saw traffic jam, yet that hasn't stopped tourists.""For Kashmiris, Chillai Kalan or intense winter is as much about survival as celebration. The season's snowfall replenishes the high-altitude water reservoirs that feed rivers of the Valley -- Jhelum, Indus, Chenab etc, streams and lakes through summer. This makes the daily life and survival challenging.Snow after January 30 melts too fast to serve this purpose, which is why the first snowfall of Chillai Kalan is greeted like a festival.Srinagar resident and shawl seller Shafique Chaudhary says the season brings a special kind of joy.""Chillai Kalan has really tightened its grip this year. Daily routines slow down because mornings are painfully cold and water lines freeze often. But people here are used to adjusting — we layer up, start work later, and rely more on kangris.:He added, ""The harsh cold also brings a certain calm to the city, something only winter in Kashmir can create.""He described the familiar winter scene: pherans, kangris, streets filled with bundled-up locals, and constant cups of kahwa and noon chai keeping people going.Gulfam Beigh, a Shikara operator on Dal Lake, captures the essence of winter in Srinagar through the eyes of both locals and visitors.He said, ""Chillai Kalan means fewer hours on the water because parts of Dal Lake start icing up early. But tourists still come for the experience. They’re fascinated by the thin ice sheets along the edges.""""Work is tougher -- hands go numb quickly -- yet this season has its own magic. The quietness of winter draws serious travellers,"" he added.Anantnag-based driver Mohammad Zaheer feels the winter both helps and challenges him: ""For us drivers, Chillai Kalan is both a challenge and a boost… Roads are slippery in the mornings… But tourist pickups have increased because they want to explore snow spots.""He added, ""Business stays steady, though we spend more on heaters and maintenance. The cold tests everyone, but it also brings visitors who appreciate Kashmir's winter charm.""As the bone-chilling winter descends upon the Himalayas and the 40-day Chillai Kalan grips Jammu and Kashmir , ANI sources in the defence establishment said the Army has stepped-up counterterror actions across Kishtwar and Doda districts, just south of the Valley.Undeterred by freezing temperatures, treacherous terrain, and heavy snowfall, Army units have expanded into higher, snowbound areas to pursue Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment.""This winter marks a decisive shift in operational approach,"" said a source. ""Instead of reducing activities, the Army has adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.""A key feature of this year’s counter-terror strategy is the integrated approach. The Army is leading a synchronized effort with multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the Civil Administration, Jammu and Kashmir Police, CRPF, SOG, Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards. ""This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution,"" the source added.Intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully analysed to map terrorist movements and hideouts. Once verified, coordinated operations are launched, minimising overlaps and maximising impact. About 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists are currently in the Jammu region, and intelligence suggests they have shifted to higher and mid-mountain areas, now largely uninhabited. ""These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection,"" the source said.Reports indicate remnants of these groups are attempting to coerce villagers for shelter and food, but their local support has sharply declined. Continuous security vigilance and isolation have restricted their ability to regroup or plan attacks.The Army in this winter is focused on two goals -- eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and ensure they remain limited and restricted to inhospitable high-altitude areas. ""Security forces have launched concurrent operations along valleys, mid-altitude regions, and high ridges to maintain overlapping control and deny any potential movement corridor,"" said the source. Each operation is followed by sustained surveillance, forming the ""surveillance-sweep-surveillance"" cycle, the cornerstone of the Army's new winter doctrine.Snowbound terrain makes the whole task of Army operation challenging, and it requires specialised training and equipment also. ""The Indian Army has deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat,"" the ANI source said. These troops have been crucial in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.Snowfall during Chillai Kalan delivers essential ""chilling hours"" that sustain Kashmir’s apple orchards, a backbone of its economy.And with its lakes freezing at the edges and wetlands opening up, the Valley has recorded a huge influx of migratory birds this winter, escaping harsher climates elsewhere.","Kashmir's winter unfolds in three distinct phases: chillai kalan, chillai khurd, and chillai bachha. Winter is traditionally kashmir's most dramatic season, but this year, the valley is witnessing a remarkable inflow of visitors.

Ambala man arrested for allegedly spying on Air Force; under investigation



NEW DELHI: In two separate cases of alleged espionage reported within 24 hours, authorities in Punjab and Haryana have arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pathankot and a contractor from Ambala for allegedly sharing sensitive defence-related information with Pakistan-linked handlers. Police in both states said the accused were in contact with individuals across the border and had passed on details connected to key security installations.A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI , terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers, Punjab Police said on Tuesday.Police identified the juvenile as Sanjeev Kumar . According to officials, he was tricked by Pakistani handlers on social media. Police said he believed that his father had been murdered, which made him emotionally vulnerable.SSP Pathankot Daljinder Singh Dhillon said, ""The police have arrested Sanjeev Kumar, aged 15, after receiving information that he had been supplying information related to the security of our nation to the frontal organisations of terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers.""He added that the boy was drawn in by Pakistani accounts online.""He fell into the trap of Pakistani agencies through social media, as he was suspicious that his father had been murdered, which affected him mentally. However, the investigation did not reveal any such evidence,"" Dhillon said.According to police, Sanjeev had sent videos of several sensitive locations and had been in contact with gangsters based in Pakistan who run terror modules. ""He had been in contact with Pakistan’s terror organisations for almost a year,"" the SSP said.Police are investigating how much information he shared and who he was in contact with. The boy is currently in custody, and further action will be taken based on the investigation.In an another incident in neighbouring state -- Haryana, another man in Ambala was held for allegedly spying on Air Force, as confirmed by DSP Crime on Tuesday.DSP Crime Virendra Kumar said the accused, Sunil alias Sunny, had been a contractor handling repair work at an Air Force station since 2020.“The police had information that he was providing details about our defence area, specifically the Air Force. His mobile was seized and several suspicious things emerged from it,” Kumar said.The officer added that Sunil had been in contact with a woman who allegedly asked for information, which he passed on. “According to his device, he used to send information to a neighbouring country, which we can call an enemy country. But this is his version. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.Sunil is married with two children and is currently on four days of remand. The probe is in its initial stages.","A 15-year-old boy from pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with pakistan's isi.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh commissioned the Indian Coast Guard 's (ICG) first indigenously designed and built pollution control vessel 'Samudra Pratap' in Goa on Monday, saying the ship will ""bolster India's self-confidence"". The 114.5-metre vessel, built by Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), has over 60% of indigenous content.During the commissioning of 'Samudra Pratap' in Goa, the defence minister said, “""Commissioning of this ship will increase our strength. This ship is the symbol of our collective resolve. When this ship advances against the waves, then our Coast Guard and India's self-confidence will also be bolstered. I have been told that this ship is designed with a focus on pollution control, but I also believe it is capable of search and rescue operations, coastal patrol and is important in strengthening maritime safety. ""‘Samudra Pratap’, which is a significant milestone in India’s journey towards self-reliance in defence production, is also the largest ship in the Indian Coast Guard’s (ICG) fleet, significantly enhancing its operational reach and capability.""It is a product of the modern approach adopted by GSL, to enhance flexibility and readiness to deal with present-day maritime challenges,” Rajnath said, adding, “Our Coast Guard has instilled such fear in the minds of our enemies that if anyone dares to even cast an eye toward our borders, the Coast Guard will leave them in no condition to do so again.""He said the 'Samudra Pratap' commissioning is linked to the country's grand maritime vision, which recognises that marine resources are not the property of any single nation but the shared heritage of humanity. “When a heritage is shared, the responsibility for its protection is also shared. That is why India today stands firmly on the global stage, guided by the principles of peace, stability, and environmental responsibility,"" he said.On X, ICG said. “Built by GSL with over 60% indigenous content, the 114.5 metre, 4,200 tonnes vessel boasts a speed of more than 22 knots and an endurance of 6,000 nm, significantly enhancing the ICG’s pollution response, fire-fighting, and maritime safety and security capabilities.”Equipped with advanced systems, ‘Samudra Pratap’ will significantly enhance ICG’s capability to address oil spills, maritime emergencies and security challenges in exclusive economic zones and beyond. It has been designed and constructed in-house to meet the coast guard’s specific operational requirements.The vessel is equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including a 30mm CRN-91 gun, two 12.7mm stabilised remote-controlled guns with integrated fire control systems, an indigenously developed integrated bridge system, integrated platform management system, automated power management system, and a high-capacity external firefighting system, as per ICG. The ship will be based at ICG’s Kochi base.Hailing India as a responsible maritime power, the Defence Minister said that, ""At a time when the world is passing through an era of global maritime uncertainty, India has repeatedly proven that it safeguards not only its own interests but also ensures peace and stability across the entire Indo-Pacific region. This inclusive approach of moving forward together is what makes India a responsible maritime power.""“We must shape norms in the field of maritime governance, strengthen capacity-building initiatives and advance cooperative frameworks.

Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro made his first appearance in a US courtroom on Monday following his capture, entering a plea of not guilty to all charges and asserting that he remains Venezuela’s legitimate leader.“I am innocent, I am not guilty,” Maduro told the judge, adding, “I am a decent man.”As he continued speaking in Spanish, he said, “I am still president of my country,” before being cut off by Judge Alvin Hellerstein.“A plea of not guilty will be entered on behalf of Mr Maduro,” Hellerstein said, halting Maduro mid-sentence.Defence attorney Barry Pollack later confirmed that Maduro was entering a plea of not guilty to all four charges.During the hearing, Maduro told the court that he had not yet seen the indictment against him and was unaware of his legal rights.“I did not know of these rights,” he said through an interpreter. “Your honor is informing me of them now,” reported AP.Earlier in the hearing, a court-appointed translator relayed Maduro’s account of his arrest. “I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela,” the translator said on his behalf.Maduro entered the courtroom shortly after 12 pm (local time) wearing prison attire, with his feet shackled and headphones on for translation, reported CBS news.His wife, Cilia Flores, who appeared alongside him, wore similar prison clothing. Both had their hands unshackled. Maduro briefly shook hands with his attorney upon entering the courtroom.After Maduro entered his plea, Judge Hellerstein turned to his wife to confirm her identity. Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, she said, “I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.”When asked to enter a plea, Flores responded, “Not guilty. Completely innocent.”Near the end of the hearing, Maduro’s lawyer said his client “is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege” that such a status confers. Pollack also raised “questions about the legality of his military abduction,” adding that there would be “voluminous” pretrial filings to challenge the case on legal grounds.The proceedings concluded at 12.31 pm (local time) after Flores’s attorney, Mark Donnelly, told the court that his client was suffering from “health and medical issues that will require attention.” Donnelly said Flores, 69, may have sustained a fracture or severe bruising to her ribs and could require a full X-ray examination.Both Maduro and Flores agreed to remain in custody for now, with their lawyers reserving the right to seek bail at a later stage.Maduro is being represented by Pollack, a veteran trial lawyer. Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He also helped broker the 2024 plea deal under which Assange pleaded guilty to a single felony count related to publishing US military secrets.Further proceedings in the case will be held on March 17.","Venezuelan leader nicolás maduro made his first appearance in a us courtroom on monday following his capture.

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000.

Jim Bowden says Kazuma Okamoto is a good hitter but “not the right fit” for Toronto





Kazuma Okamoto became the newest name in the Toronto Blue Jays’ offseason plans after the team signed the Japanese power hitter to a four-year, $60 million contract over the weekend. The move was meant to boost the Blue Jays’ batting lineup, but it quickly sparked debate across Major League Baseball circles.Soon after the deal became public, MLB insider Jim Bowden shared a strong reaction. Speaking on the Foul Territory podcast this week, Bowden said he did not like how Toronto used its money. He believes the Blue Jays should have chased bigger targets like Kyle Tucker or Bo Bichette instead of spending overseas.Jim Bowden spoke about the signing during a recent episode of the Foul Territory podcast, which streams from the United States and features daily MLB talk from former executives and analysts.While discussing Toronto’s offseason moves, Bowden made it clear he was not impressed with the direction. “Yeah, I like the player, but I don’t like the fit for Toronto,” Bowden said.“I don’t like that they signed him. I don’t like that they invested that money in him.I’d rather see that money go for Kyle Tucker or Bo Bichette, or both.”Bowden did not question Kazuma Okamoto’s bat. In fact, he praised his hitting skills and power. He explained that Okamoto has a strong swing, can drive the ball, and knows how to get on base.“I really like the bat,” Bowden added. “I think he can hit. I think he’s got more power than people think. He puts the ball in play and he’ll draw walks.”Okamoto, who built his career in Japan before moving to MLB, is expected to add pop to Toronto’s order.The Blue Jays finalized the deal over the weekend after weeks of reports linking them to both overseas talent and big MLB names.Jim Bowden’s biggest concern was not offense. It was defense. While still on the podcast, he pointed out that Toronto’s success last season came from strong fielding, not just hitting. “I think the bat fits what they want to do,” Bowden said.“But he can’t really play third base well. He’s a below-average defender. One thing I loved about the Blue Jays last year was that they were the best defensive team in the American League.”Bowden believes adding Okamoto changes that identity. He feels the team moved away from what made them strong.During the same show, Bowden also spoke about how this signing affects Toronto’s future moves. He said the contract likely takes the Blue Jays out of the race to sign both Kyle Tucker and Bo Bichette.“It takes them out of doing both Tucker and Bichette,” Bowden said. “But it doesn’t take them out of doing one or the other.”The Blue Jays have been heavily linked to Bo Bichette in recent weeks, while Kyle Tucker has also been mentioned in offseason talks. With Okamoto now signed, fans are watching closely to see which direction Toronto chooses next.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Cody Bellinger Draws Chicago Cubs And New York Yankees Interest While Rockies Weigh Brenton Doyle, Mickey Moniak Moves","Toronto blue jays signed japanese power hitter kazuma okamoto to a four-year, $60 million contract over the weekend.

Biden Fumbles “America” in Onstage Slip, Triggering Waves of Mockery and Renewed Scrutiny

Why Biden’s retirement package is historically unusual and how it funds his operations for life

How much do Presidents and Congress members get in pensions





The career politics of former US President Joe Biden have given him the experience to retire with the highest government-funded retirement package ever given to a US President. This is worth $417,000 annually compared to his current salary package as President, worth $400,000. According to Demian Brady, the Vice President at the National Taxpayer Union Foundation , former President Biden’s career experience gave him a chance to retire under two separate retirement plans at the same time due to his roles as a senator, a vice President, and a President. This is twice the retirement package former US President Barack Obama receives.As reported, the income that Biden will receive during his retirement comes from two different sources. First, the income for the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was calculated depending on the 44 years he had served as a senator and the vice president. His three highest years of income were also taken into account. Brady estimates the income for the CSRS to be at $166,374 a year, with an additional payment of $18,186 to cover the spousal benefit. Without the CSRS restriction on the payment to 80% of the highest paid salary, he would have earned more than 254,000 dollars.The second source would be the Former Presidents Act of 1958, where the presidential pension would be equivalent to that of a Cabinet secretary, at present $250,600 per annum. Moreover, the act also takes care of providing office space and office personnel, office equipment, and travel expenses for free for a lifetime.Brady explains the nature of Biden’s pension by stating that his retirement compensation package is “historically unusual,” stating that very few former presidents have been able to reap the benefits of two prominent retirement systems ever in the nation’s history. The fact that Biden, in addition to his experience in the Senate and his vice presidency, served a complete presidential term gives the retired president the ability to benefit beyond the current sitting president’s salary.Apart from money for the pension, Biden gets quite a lot of money to finance operations for life. For the financial year 2026, the General Services Administration allocated over $1.5 million to finance operations for his office, including $727,000 for office space without any limit to size and location. This takes care of all operational expenditure, as well as employees and office equipment. Brady has expressed reservations that younger presidents, like Obama, should enjoy offices for life that can be used to write a book or land a speaking engagement, as Obama did later in life.As reported, Biden’s generous pension package has reignited debate about retirement benefits for senators and representatives financed by taxpayers. This year, in 2025, a Senate bill titled the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act has been proposed by Sen. Joni Ernst to limit the retirement package to $200,000. An earlier form of the act was passed by Congress in 2016 but was vetoed by President Obama, who would have enjoyed the same benefits, raising questions about fairness, fiscal responsibility, precedent, and long-term policy implications.The issue also goes beyond the presidents alone. Each member of Congress is eligible for a federal pension after five years of service at a cost of around $38 million a year. Controversial ones include Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who retired after meeting the requisite eligibility, earning her a pension of $8,717 a year, in comparison to Rep. Nancy Pelosi's $107,860 a year. Still, Rep. Greene could earn over $265,000 in her lifetime.","Former us president joe biden has the highest government-funded retirement package ever given to a us president.

Remembering Emma Biffle: family privacy request and how to support





NASCAR legend Greg Biffle's 14 year old daughter Emma, has been laid to rest nearly three weeks after her tragic death. Emma was among seven people who lost their lives in a devastating plane crash on 18th December. Many people continue to mourn the young life that was taken far too soon.A memorial service for Emma was held at the Cain Center in Cornelius, North Carolina. Friends, family members, and figures from the NASCAR world gathered to honor her memory on Sunday, January 3. The service was filled with emotion as loved ones reflected on Emma’s life and her kindness.During the memorial, Emma’s mother Nicole shared a deeply emotional letter. She was unable to read it herself due to grief. In the letter, Nicole spoke about the pain she feels over allowing Emma to fly that day, especially since her daughter had not been feeling well. She also revealed that she had bought plane tickets to Italy the night before the crash as a Christmas gift for Emma, a detail that added to the heartbreak felt by those in attendance.Emma’s obituary, written last month, described her as “an amazing light in this world.”It went on to say, “She was fun, outgoing, funny, caring, and above all, a pure soul full of love. She was a good friend to all and always cared how others felt.” The obituary added that she will be deeply missed by everyone who loved her, especially her mother, with whom she shared an extremely close bond. It also highlighted Emma’s deep love for animals and suggested donations in her memory be made to local animal shelters.The crash also claimed the lives of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, their five-year-old son Ryder, and close family friends Dennis Dutton, his son Jack, and Craig Wadsworth. The aircraft, a Cessna C550, reportedly circled back shortly after taking off from Statesville Regional Airport but failed to land. Investigations by the NTSB and FAA are still ongoing.Former NASCAR driver Kenny Wallace shared his personal theory about the crash, stressing it was only speculation. He suggested the plane’s flaps may have been down, causing heavy drag after a possible engine failure. Another witness, Jonathan Donoghue, said, “All I know is that there was a large, loud pop, like something broke on the plane at takeoff.”A joint funeral was also held for Dennis Dutton, a former commercial pilot and Air Force veteran, and his 20-year-old son Jack. Craig Wadsworth was remembered fondly by his roommate Benito Howell, who said, “He didn’t know how to say no. He loved everybody. He always tried to help everybody.”A public memorial for Greg Biffle will take place on January 16 at Charlotte’s Bojangles Coliseum.Also Read: NASCAR star Denny Hamlin reveals his mother is recovering after tragic house fire takes his father’s life","Nascar legend greg biffle puts 14-year-old daughter emma to rest, weeks after tragic plane crash.

Trump’s Chilling Missive To Ukraine After US Forces Capture Maduro





US forces killed at least 55 Venezuelan and Cuban military and security personnel during the raid that led to the capture and ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, according to official tolls released by Caracas and Havana on Tuesday.Venezuela’s military confirmed for the first time that 23 of its service members were killed in Saturday’s US attacks. Authorities have not yet released an official figure for civilian casualties. Cuba said 32 members of its armed forces and interior ministry security personnel deployed in Caracas died in the operation.The Cuban casualties ranged in age from 26 to 67 and included two colonels and one lieutenant colonel. Venezuelan defence minister Vladimir Padrino López said many of the Cuban personnel killed were believed to be part of Maduro’s security detail, which was largely wiped out during the assault.The operation began with bombing raids on military targets and ended with US special forces landing by helicopter to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from a compound. Both were flown to New York, where they appeared in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday urged Washington to ensure Maduro receives a “fair trial”.Within hours of the court appearance, Maduro’s former deputy Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as interim president. US President Donald Trump said he was willing to work with Rodríguez provided she met his demands to allow US companies access to Venezuela’s oil reserves.Rodríguez now faces the challenge of navigating US pressure while keeping Maduro loyalists within the security establishment on her side. She has sought to project unity with hardliners in the former administration, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Padrino López, both of whom have retained their posts.Concerns over repression persisted as a journalists’ union reported that 14 journalists and media workers, most of them from foreign outlets, were detained while covering Rodríguez’s inauguration at parliament on Monday. Two other foreign media journalists were detained near the Colombian border. All were later released.Opposition leader María Corina Machado criticised Rodríguez in an interview with Fox News, saying she could not be trusted. “Delcy Rodriguez as you know is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narcotrafficking,” Machado said. “She's the main ally and liaison with Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual that could be trusted by international investors.”Trump has publicly backed Rodríguez so far but warned she would face consequences if she failed to follow Washington’s agenda. He described Maduro on Tuesday as a “violent guy” who “killed millions of people” and claimed, “They have a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they are closing up.”Under Venezuela’s constitution, once Maduro is formally declared absent, elections must be held within 30 days. Machado said she was confident of victory in such a vote. “In free and fair elections, we will win by over 90 percent of the votes, I have no doubt about it,” she told Fox News.She pledged to “turn Venezuela into the energy hub of the Americas”, “dismantle all these criminal structures” and “bring millions of Venezuelans that have been forced to flee our country back home”. Machado also said she would give her Nobel prize to Trump, though she added that she has not spoken to the US president since October 10.",Venezuela’s military confirmed for the first time that 23 of its service members were killed. Cuba said 32 members of its armed forces and interior ministry security personnel deployed in caracas died in the operation. The cuban casualties ranged in age from 26 to 67 and included two colonels and one lieutenant colonel.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126381164,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Twitch streamer Krimoe detained near the Houses of Parliament during live broadcast







A Twitch streamer has been arrested in London after a livestream showed a toy gun being waved near the Houses of Parliament. The incident happened in a busy public place, with famous landmarks clearly visible in the background. Police acted fast after the video appeared online and raised safety concerns.The streamer, known online as Krimoe, was broadcasting live on Twitch when officers arrived at the scene. He was later arrested on suspicion of having an imitation firearm in a public place. The arrest happened while the group was still live, making the moment spread quickly on social media.The Metropolitan Police confirmed that 11 men were arrested in total. All were later released on bail as officers continue their investigation. No one was hurt, but the case has sparked serious questions about public safety, livestream behavior, and responsibility online. The incident happened close to some of the most guarded locations in the UK, which is why police took it very seriously from the start.Krimoe, who has more than 48,000 followers, was part of a group livestreaming near the Houses of Parliament.The video showed the Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster clearly behind them.During the stream, a toy gun appeared on camera. It was pointed toward the lens and then passed around between people in the group. Moments later, police officers arrived and stopped the broadcast.The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that officers arrested 11 men “on suspicion of possession of an imitation firearm in a public place.” Police added that all suspects have been bailed while further checks are carried out.UK law treats imitation firearms seriously, especially in public places. Although it was a prop - it could still cause fear and panic especially when used in an environment such as Parliament that is very sensitive to the public. There were many comments made during the live-streamed incident stating how reckless the actions were. Others pointed out how livestreams can turn risky when creators try to shock viewers for attention.Twitch, which launched in 2011, allows users to broadcast live for long hours. While it started mainly for gaming, many streamers now use it for outdoor and lifestyle content. This case has again raised concerns about safety rules and how far creators should go during live broadcasts. Police have not confirmed when charging decisions will be made. For now, the investigation remains open.Also Read: Did Twitch Get Hacked?

Why Candace Owens says the split never truly ended





The fallout between Candace Owens and The Daily Wire continues to spill into public view, nearly two years after their split. What was once framed as a clean professional break has now resurfaced as something far more personal. Owens says recent actions by her former employer reopened old wounds she believed were long settled.Speaking candidly on her January 6 broadcast, Owens described the experience as unsettling rather than surprising. She made it clear she had no interest in reigniting old conflicts. Still, she felt compelled to respond after discovering that old promotional material tied to her Daily Wire tenure had been revived without her consent. For Owens, the issue was not nostalgia. It was control.Owens told listeners the situation felt deeply unhealthy, labeling the dynamic “actually toxic.” She compared her former employer’s behavior to that of an obsessive former partner, explaining, ""I truly am not trying to be dramatic here, it felt like a crazy ex-stalker. like if I can't have you nobody can have you"". The quote set the tone for a broader reflection on boundaries and power after professional separations.According to Owens, the resurfaced content included reactivated social media accounts and an old trailer from her early days at the outlet. She stressed the material was shared without her approval and said the timing left her confused and uneasy. She believed the move was meant to promote new programming rather than reflect her current work, which only added to her frustration.Later in the episode, she expanded on the emotional toll, saying, ""I genuinely feel like when you break up with someone and you have a crazy ex, that was how it felt like being fired from the Daily Wire, except in this circumstance, the ex broke up with you, but then I guess like maybe changed their mind or just didn't want to see you move on and be happy or successful"".Owens joined the Daily Wire in 2021 and was fired in March 2024 following public disputes over her comments on Israel and Gaza. The decision was confirmed by CEO Jeremy Boreing, with co-founder Ben Shapiro openly criticizing her remarks.Although Owens mentioned afterwards that the shooting has been the catalyst that helped her podcast hit the top of the world charts, recent remarks indicate that the personal chapter was never properly closed.Also Read: “Pretend like Erica didn't know…”: Candace Owens expresses disgust over AmFest’s recreation of Charlie Kirk's murder scene","Candace owens claims her former employer, the daily wire, has reopened old wounds by reviving promotional material from her tenure without consent.

Nicholas Jynxzi explains the DDoS attacks and his plan to take legal action







Twitch star Nicholas Jynxzi had his livestream shut down again after repeated DDoS attacks interrupted his broadcast. The incident happened on January 5, 2026, while Jynxzi was live on Twitch, playing Rocket League and Arc Raiders with fellow streamers TheBurntPeanut and Kylie “Sketch”. Right from the start, viewers noticed something was wrong. The stream kept freezing. A message saying “connection lost, be back soon” appeared again and again. Each time the stream returned, it dropped soon after. By the end, Jynxzi confirmed his internet was being attacked on purpose.This was not a small issue. It forced him to end the stream early. It also marked the second time in one week that he could not go live. Because of this, Jynxzi said he is now planning legal action against the people behind the attacks.After nearly four hours, Jynxzi finally explained the situation on stream. At the 3:54:58 timestamp, he shared what his internet provider told him and why the stream could not continue.He said:“So, I got off the phone with the internet provider. They are not able to change it right now. We have to set up a lot of things tonight and tomorrow, like VPNs and a dynamic router, so the IP keeps changing. We are not going to be able to stream Arc Raiders tonight.There is no way. We cannot get the IP changed right now.”Jynxzi then made it clear that this situation had gone too far. He said the attacks were illegal and that he planned to involve major platforms and developers. He explained that he would reach out to people he knows at Ubisoft and Twitch.He added:“I am going to contact everybody I know at Ubisoft and Twitch. We already have some people’s information that was sent to us. I will do everything in my power to make sure someone goes to jail. This is illegal. This is a cybersecurity crime. I cannot stream tonight, and this is the second time this week this has happened.”DDoS attacks flood a person’s internet with traffic, forcing it offline. For streamers, this means lost income and broken schedules. Jynxzi’s case is not the first. For now, Nicholas Jynxzi says his focus is on fixing security and stopping future attacks before returning to regular streams.Also Read: Top 10 Most Subscribed YouTube Channels In The World","Twitch star nicholas jynxzi had his livestream shut down again after repeated ddos attacks.
