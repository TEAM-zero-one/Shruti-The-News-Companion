Ex-Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan's 'Op Sindoor' Remark Sparks Row, BJP Hits Back

.

NEW DELHI: A political storm erupted on Tuesday after former Maharashtra chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan claimed that India was “completely defeated” on the first day of Operation Sindoor, while questioning the conduct of the military operation. His remarks triggered sharp criticism from the BJP Speaking to reporters in Pune, Chavan alleged that India suffered setbacks on the first day of the operation.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor) we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda, or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan , which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” Chavan said.The Congress leader further alleged that Operation Sindoor, involved only aerial and missile warfare and saw no ground movement by the armed forces.“Recently, we saw during Operation Sindoor, there was not even a one-kilometre movement of the military... Whatever happened over two or three days was only an aerial war and missile warfare. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?” he said.Reacting strongly to Chavan’s remarks, BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla accused the Congress of repeatedly disrespecting the Indian Armed Forces and undermining national security operations.In a post on X, Poonawalla wrote that the statements made by the former Maharashtra chief minister were “shocking” and targeted the Air Force and the armed forces.He said, “Shocking Controversial statements by congress on Air Force and Armed Forces By Prithviraj Chavan. He says on the first day (of Operation Sindoor) we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. In the future too, wars will be fought in the same way. In such a situation, do we really need to maintain an army of 12 lakh soldiers, or can we make they do some other work?”He further alleged that the Congress “hates Indian Armed Forces” and said “Sena ka apman is Congress ki pehchaan,” adding that the party has a history of questioning military actions, from “Sadak ka gunda to doubting Sindoor / Surgical Strike/ Balakote and even Op Mahadev.”Operation Sindoor was launched by India on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was carried out in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 civilians were killed.","Former maharashtra chief minister prithviraj chavan claims india was 'completely defeated' on the first day of operation sindoor. Chavan also questions the conduct of the military operation.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday warned that India would not remain silent and teach a ""lesson"" if politicians in Bangladesh continued to make remarks about India's northeastern region.His comments came a day after Hasnat Abdullah, a senior leader of the newly formed National Citizen Party, said Dhaka should “isolate” India’s northeastern states and support separatist elements in the region if New Delhi attempted to “destabilise” the neighbouring country.""For the last one year, statements have been coming repeatedly from that country (Bangladesh) that the states of northeast India should be separated and made a part of Bangladesh.We are a very big country, a nuclear nation and the world’s fourth-largest economy.

We will not remain silent,"" the BJP leader added.On Monday, Abdullah, a key leader of the student-led protests that brought down Bangladesh's Sheikh Hasina government in August last year, claimed that India’s north-eastern states were geographically ""vulnerable"" as they depend on the narrow Siliguri Corridor, also known as the ""Chicken’s Neck"", for connectivity with the rest of the country.Hasina has been living in Delhi since fleeing Dhaka, and ties between the two neighbours have been at an all-time low since her ouster. Last month, an International Crimes Tribunal found her guilty and sentenced her to death for ""crimes against humanity"" during the protests.

Sonia Gandhi Targets Modi Govt On ASHA, Anganwadi Workers In Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha on Monday pressed for reforms in the anti-defection law and electoral processes, arguing that defections, voter list issues and institutional weaknesses undermine the people’s mandate and raise questions over the “purity of elections”.While questioning the need for the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls currently under way in 10 states and Union territories, the govt said the exercise was “constitutionally valid” and had been conducted several times in the past.Placing the debate in a broader ideological context, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said electoral reforms strike at the heart of India’s freedom struggle and constitutional democracy, warning that any dilution of voting rights or institutional independence would hollow out the republic from within.“The core of Indian democracy lies in every individual’s right to vote and a government elected through those votes. If universal voting rights, free and fair elections by an independent Election Commission , and constitutional institutions are weakened, democracy becomes an illusion,” he said.Former Prime Minister H D Devegowda cautioned the Opposition against repeatedly alleging “vote chori”. “By using the words ‘vote chori’ you are going to suffer in the coming days.You are not going to win the battle,” he said, asserting that institutions such as the Election Commission and the Supreme Court were in place to address electoral issues and that people had confidence in the system.Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh demanded that all slips generated from VVPAT machines be counted simultaneously to restore public trust in EVMs. On the proposed ‘One Nation, One Election’ framework, he termed it an “insult” to federalism and a step towards “fascist dictatorship”. Singh also alleged that Union home minister Amit Shah was never part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, triggering sharp reactions from the treasury benches. Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal accused Singh of “misinterpreting” Shah’s earlier statement in the Lok Sabha.Opposition members also cited the wide gap in funding available to political parties, stressing the need for a level-playing field in electoral processes. AAP MP Sandeep Kumar Pathak urged reforms in the funding of political parties.K R Suresh Reddy of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) said defections had become routine, particularly in smaller states with narrow legislative margins. “Anti-defection is the name of the game today, especially in smaller states,” he said, noting that defecting legislators often fail to deliver on manifesto promises. He suggested setting up a parliamentary committee to make anti-defection provisions “watertight”.Echoing similar concerns, CPI(M) member John Brittas said the mandate must be respected even after elections. “When horse trading happens, when mass defections happen, when resorts become sanctum sanctorum, the purity of elections is in question,” he said, observing that while the law earlier curbed “retail defection”, “now wholesale defection is happening”.Responding to the Opposition, Law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal said SIR was constitutionally valid and had been undertaken several times earlier. He said the revision of electoral rolls was rooted in the constitutional framework laid down by B R Ambedkar, adding that even the Supreme Court had affirmed the Election Commission’s power to conduct SIR. Meghwal alleged that Congress had humiliated Ambedkar during his lifetime and public career.JD(U) member Sanjay Kumar Jha cited the February 2005 Bihar elections, claiming that despite Nitish Kumar having support, President’s rule was imposed after a midnight Cabinet meeting. “No MLA took oath… they are called ‘abhutpurv MLAs’,” he said.","Opposition members in the rajya sabha on monday pressed for reforms in the anti-defection law and electoral processes.

Driving the news

Allies are burdens.

Values are luxuries.

Power must be unilateral.

“We must continue to improve commercial relations with India to encourage it to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through the Quad with

Australia

and Japan.”

The NSS 2025

Why it matters

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

Roosevelt Corollary

The big picture: The two-front contest with China

India sits at the intersection of both goals. It is one of the few countries that:

Can match China’s geographic and demographic scale.

Offers manufacturing and investment alternatives.

Shares an interest in freedom of navigation and supply chain resilience.

Zoom in: Quad as an action platform, not a talking shop

The NSS views the Quad as:

A regional security multiplier, especially in maritime surveillance and logistics.

A counterweight to China’s dominance in chokepoints, including the South China Sea and Indian Ocean.

A framework to deepen tech and defense coordination, without requiring a formal alliance.

The maritime logic: India in the South China Sea

It recognizes India as a maritime player, not just a continental one.

It reframes sea-lane control as an economic security issue, not just a military one.

It suggests India’s strategic geography and naval presence (especially in the Andaman and Nicobar region) is integral to the Indo-Pacific security architecture.

Between the lines: Tech, minerals, and ecosystems

Nuclear deterrence

India and the Global South: Opportunity-and pressure

India also seeks to expand in the Global South, including Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

The US effort to diversify supply chains offers a potential investment windfall for Indian manufacturing.

But it also means more alignment pressure from Washington-especially on:

Tech standards Export controls Transshipment enforcement

Strategic ambiguity meets shrinking space

Technology alliances

Critical-mineral blocs

Security coalitions

Burden-sharing: India’s special status-and subtle ask

The bottom line

India has been drafted

""Help us win, or step aside.""

The Donald Trump administration’s 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) doesn’t just chart a course-it redraws the map. Released quietly at night, the 29-page document abandons decades of bipartisan foreign-policy orthodoxy in favor of a singular, transactional view of global power-and puts India at the crossroads.In this Trumpian worldview:India is named four times-and each time, the ask is clear: Contribute more, align more, expect less.The 2025 NSS is Trump’s clearest articulation of “America First” applied globally-a strategy driven not by alliances or ideology, but by leverage, deterrence, and self-interest.Plus, the new National Security Strategy is the clearest statement yet of how Washington sees power shifting in the Indo-Pacific.China is the central competitor. The Indo-Pacific is the primary theater.Trump’s NSS also shows deep nostalgia for 19th-century power politics. It invokes theto the Monroe Doctrine, warning Latin America not to allow “hostile foreign ownership” of key assets. It praises “Western identity” and warns that some Nato members may become “majority non-European”—a line critics say reeks of racial nationalism.“Certain Nato members will become majority non-European. It is an open question whether they will view their alliance with the US in the same way.”The NSS breaks the China challenge into two interlocking priorities:1. Rebalance the economic relationship-using tariffs, industrial policy, and supply chain realignment.2. Maintain credible military deterrence in the Indo-Pacific to prevent conflict.The goal, per the document: a “virtuous cycle” where economic discipline funds long-term defense strength, and military stability creates space for harder economic measures.This isn’t diplomacy for diplomacy’s sake. India is now a strategic node in an integrated effort to restructure power in Asia-militarily, economically, and technologically.By naming the Quad as a vehicle for India’s expanded security role, the strategy treats the grouping as a real mechanism, not a slogan.India’s role in the Quad (with Australia, Japan, and the US) gets specific attention in the strategy. The message: this is not about feel-good alignment among democracies-it’s about concrete strategic coordination.Importantly, the US accepts that India will avoid alliance language. But Washington still wants interoperability, joint awareness, and shared capability development.One of the most pointed passages in the NSS warns of the risk of Chinese coercion in sea lanes: “Control over the South China Sea would allow a competitor to impose de facto tolls or threaten closure of vital global commerce routes.”It adds: Addressing this threat will require cooperation from all affected nations-“explicitly including India.”Why it’s notable:This marks a paradigm shift. In Donald Trump administration’s view, India is no longer just guarding its own neighborhood-it’s involved in shaping regional order.A long section of the strategy links deterrence to economic and technological primacy. The NSS defines future military power through economic and technological strength-naming:India is seen as a potential partner in building trusted ecosystems, not reliant on China. The logic: the US wants to de-Sinicize the global innovation stack, and India could help build a non-Chinese infrastructure of trust.The document also makes explicit reference to critical minerals and influence in Africa, noting that:“The US should enlist European and Asian allies and partners, including India, to secure access and shape norms.”Translation: India isn’t just a regional actor-it’s part of a global coalition effort to compete with China across emerging markets, tech governance, and strategic resources.The NSS notes that China’s exports to low- and middle-income countries doubled between 2020 and 2024-and now surpass exports to the US.Why it matters for India:India may find itself pushed to take sides, particularly as Chinese platforms become more embedded in third-country markets.India has long practiced strategic autonomy, balancing ties with the US, Russia, China, and others.But the NSS implies that ambiguity is becoming costly. Washington is constructing:And India is expected to be part of them, even without a treaty.The NSS’s tone suggests a “coalition of the willing” model-with partners taking on real commitments, not just symbolic ones. And India is no longer outside that circle.Unlike Japan or South Korea, India is not a treaty ally and does not host US bases. The NSS accepts that.But the broader message is clear: the US military “cannot, and should not have to, do this alone.”India is likely to be spared the hardest asks-no troop hosting or treaty obligations. Still, Washington will watch:The NSS sets the tone: Shared threat, shared responsibility-even without shared treaties.warns the NSS is a “dog’s breakfast” of contradictory impulses—“muscular without being hawkish, restrained without being dovish”—and dangerously dismissive of long-term allies.Chidanand Rajghatta calls the document a “hard pivot toward unilateral action” that turns India from a partner to a pressure point, noting the irony of Washington asking more from India while punishing it with tariffs.MAGA hardliners lament there’s no mention of Islamic terrorism; liberal critics decry the NSS’s silence on authoritarianism in China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.Nato allies privately worry the document is the first step to US withdrawal from the alliance—a fear stoked by Trump’s past threat to “encourage Russia” to attack freeloading Nato members.The NSS’s “America First diplomacy” leans hard into tariffs and reciprocal trade. While it promotes deeper US-India commercial ties, it doesn’t promise a smooth path.That creates a familiar dilemma for New Delhi:The NSS hints that strategic alignment will increasingly shape market access. That could put India in a tight spot-especially if it wants tech access but not tech alignment.Four key signals emerge:1. India is named-clearly-as a strategic asset.Not just a regional actor, but a necessary component of a larger China-balancing architecture.2. Maritime security is moving to center stage.India’s role in sea-lane protection and freedom-of-navigation missions is now strategic, not optional.3. The tech-minerals-economic triangle matters.India is expected to help shape the future of global production and standards-especially outside China’s orbit.4. The US expects quiet alignment-even without alliance.India won’t be asked to sign treaties. But it’s being asked to act like an ally.Watch for:Don’t expect:The NSS is a mirror: it reflects Trump’s belief that alliances are transactional, values are optional, and burden-sharing is overdue.The question isn’t whether India will align-it’s how far it can go without losing strategic independence.America First may not mean America Alone—but under Trump’s NSS,. And the fine print says:(With inputs from agencies)","The 2025 nss is trump’s clearest articulation of “america first” applied globally. It reframes sea-lane control as an economic security issue, not just a military one. The us effort to diversify supply chains offers a potential investment windfall for indian manufacturing.

In Israel, Jaishankar Condoles Sydney Attack Targeting Jews, Sends Zero Tolerance on Terror Message

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday strongly condemned the terror attack that took place during a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, underlining that India and Israel follow a policy of “zero tolerance” towards terrorism Jaishankar, who is in Israel on a two-day visit, made these remarks while speaking to reporters alongside Israeli foreign minister Gideon Moshe Sa'ar.Expressing condolences, Jaishankar said, “Let me first of all convey our very, very sincere, deep condolences at the loss of life due to the terror attack at Hanukkah celebrations in Bondi Beach.

India Slams Pakistan As ‘Global Epicentre Of Terror’, Vows To Counter Pak-Sponsored Attacks At UN

NEW DELHI: India on Monday firmly rejected Pakistan ’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council , saying the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India and will always remain so.Speaking at the UNSC Open Debate on 'Leadership for Peace', India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Harish P, said Pakistan’s repeated mention of Jammu and Kashmir reflected an “obsessive focus” on harming India and its people.He said: ""I refer to the statement made by the representative of Pakistan today. India would like to reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. They were, are, and will always remain so. Pakistan’s unwarranted reference to Jammu & Kashmir in today’s open debate attests to its obsessive focus on harming India and its people. A serving non-permanent Security Council Member that chooses to further this obsession in all meetings and platforms of the UN in pursuit of its divisive agenda cannot be expected to fulfil its designated responsibilities and obligations.The Indian envoy said India signed the Indus Waters Treaty 65 years ago in good faith and with a spirit of friendship. However, he said Pakistan had violated the spirit of the treaty over the decades by waging three wars and sponsoring thousands of terror attacks against India. He added that tens of thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terrorism over the last four decades.Referring to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, the ambassador said, ""The Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, involved religion-based targeted killings of 26 innocent civilians by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It is in this backdrop that India has finally announced that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism. ""India criticised Pakistan's domestic political situation over jailing former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and allowing its armed forces to engineer a ""constitutional coup"" through the new 27th amendment, which granted lifetime immunity to its chief of defence forces Asim Munir.""Pakistan, of course, has a unique way of respecting the will of its people - by jailing a Prime Minister, by banning the ruling political party and by letting its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving lifetime immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,"" Parvathaneni said.He further added that India would continue to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in all its forms with full resolve.",India firmly rejected pakistan’s reference to jammu and kashmir during an open debate at the united nations security council.

Diamondbacks rotation takes shape with Merrill Kelly joining Eduardo Rodriguez

Alex Bregman has been a hot topic this offseason, but on December 16, something unexpected happened. A seasoned MLB insider disclosed that the Arizona Diamondbacks are taking notice, which quickly altered the dynamics of the free agency market. At first, it seemed a bit puzzling. Arizona has young players already and a star second baseman locked in. However, if you take a deeper look, the scenario changes.Trade talks are getting intense, financial options are being considered, and the infield might change quite a bit soon. Across the league, executives and reporters are picking up on the subtle hints, suggesting that this interest is more serious than it seems.With past relationships, competing bidders, and strategic roster changes all in the mix, Bregman’s market could be on the verge of one of the most surprising developments of the offseason.The excitement surrounding Bregman and Arizona grew on December 16, 2025, when Jon Heyman from the New York Post tweeted that the Diamondbacks ""are interested"" in the 31-year-old infielder, who is among the best free agents on the market this winter.Heyman, an experienced MLB insider, posted this news on X, highlighting it as a fresh development in Bregman's free agency.Following up on Heyman's report, Bob Nightengale from USA Today took to X to call Arizona a ""surprise entrant in the Alex Bregman sweepstakes"" and stating the team is ""kicking the tires"" on a potential signing. Nightengale elaborated to his followers, ""The Dbacks would certainly have the financial flexibility if they move 2B Ketel Marte and could move 3B Jordan Lawlar to 2B.""Bregman's ability to play different positions makes him a fascinating option, especially since he could take over at third base while Lawlar moves to second, particularly if Arizona trades All-Star Ketel Marte.CBS Sports' shared similar thoughts in a roundup on December 16, mentioning that the Diamondbacks are ""kicking the tires"" on Bregman. He pointed out the necessary infield adjustments but considered them manageable.NESN's Keagan Stiefel brought attention to the unexpected twist, stating that Arizona's interest makes them fresh contenders for Bregman, especially against his old team, the Boston Red Sox.Arizona's interest in Bregman is closely linked to the current talks about trading second baseman Ketel Marte, who has a six-year, $116.5 million contract that runs through 2030, with $41 million of that being deferred.According to MLB.com, the Red Sox are leading the race to land Marte, while the Blue Jays and Mariners are also in the mix. Marte, who was the 2023 NLCS MVP and a three-time All-Star, has the ability to block trades to five teams: the Athletics, Yankees, Pirates, Giants, and Cardinals.The Athletic pointed out that Arizona wants a ""superstar-type return"" for Marte, even though some of his teammates had complaints about him last season, according to the Arizona Republic.Rob Bradford from WEEI tweeted that a source mentioned the talks between the Red Sox and Diamondbacks were ""nothing close,"" even though there was some earlier momentum that seemed to favor Boston.NESN's report hinted that interest in Bregman could speed up discussions about Marte, possibly leading to a ""quasi-swap"" where Boston trades Bregman to Arizona as part of a larger deal.Diamondbacks GM Mike Hazen has said he doesn't ""feel as if he has to trade Marte,"" per MLB.com, but the move could free up $17.25 million annually and allow Lawlar's promotion.To back any infield splash, Arizona has strengthened its pitching lineup. On December 10, the team brought on right-hander Michael Soroka with a one-year contract worth $7.5 million, including a mutual option and performance bonuses that could reach $9.5 million, according to MLB.com sources. Soroka described it as a ""dream scenario"" during a post-signing chat, thrilled about pitching year-round in his home state.A few days later, on December 14, the Diamondbacks struck a two-year, $40 million deal with free-agent right-hander Merrill Kelly bringing him back to the team after trading him midseason pending a physical.Kelly, who had a 4.23 ERA in 10 starts with Texas after the trade, will join Eduardo Rodriguez, Brandon Pfaadt, and Ryne Nelson in the rotation. These moves show Arizona's aim to compete in 2026, possibly combining Bregman's hitting with a solidified pitching staff.Also Read: Bryse Wilson joins the Philadelphia Phillies after the struggles with the Chicago White Sox and limited success",The arizona diamondbacks are reportedly interested in signing free agent alex bregman.
