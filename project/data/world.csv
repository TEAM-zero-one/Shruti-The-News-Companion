'Trying to interfere': Donald Trump's aide Peter Navarro fumes as X fact-checks India tirade; Elon Musk says 'no exceptions',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trying-to-interfere-donald-trumps-aide-peter-navarro-fumes-as-x-fact-checks-india-tirade-elon-musk-says-no-exceptions/articleshow/123755675.cms,"‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked





White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday claimed that ""Indian special interests"" were trying to ""interfere"" in the US domestic dialogue with ""lies about India buying Russian oil. "" This came after he slammed Elon Musk after his social media platform put up a fact-check note on Navarro's post regarding New Delhi's purchase of oil from Moscow.""On earlier post, you can see Indian special interests trying to interfere with domestic dialogue with lies about India buying Russian oil. Should X present this crap as comments from 'diverse viewpoints'?"" he questioned.""Should X put up posts like one below where foreign interests masquerade as objective observers and interfere with domestic US economics and politics?"" he added.""Elon Musk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russia oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukrainians. Stop taking American jobs,"" he had earlier said in a post on X.Musk defended his platform saying that people decide the ""narrative"" on X.""On this platform, the people decide the narrative. You hear all sides of an argument.Community Notes corrects everyone, no exceptions. Notes data & code is public source. Grok provides further fact-checking,"" he said.The remarks follow a post on Friday in which Navarro said: “India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins. Leftist American fake news.”Navarro grew frustrated after a Community Note appeared beneath his post on X, stating: “India's Russian oil purchases are for energy security, not just profit, & don't violate sanctions. While India has some tariffs, the U.S. has a trade surplus with it in services. US also continues to import certain commodities from Russia which is hypocritical.”On X, Community Notes are written by contributors to add context to posts that may be misleading. When enough contributors with differing perspectives rate a note as useful, it is made visible to the public.Navarro has repeatedly attacked India over its trade ties with Russia, accusing it of profiting from the war and undermining peace efforts. India has dismissed his remarks as misleading and emphasized its commitment to advancing bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect and shared interests.","White house trade advisor peter navarro slammed ""indian special interests"" for trying to ""interfere"" in the us domestic dialogue with ""lies about india buying russian oil"" this came after he slammed elon musk after his social media platform put up a fact-check note on navarro's post regarding india's purchase of oil from moscow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123755965,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-993047,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
US tariffs: Trump signs order granting exemptions; zero duties begin Monday for aligned partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-tariffs-trump-signs-order-granting-exemptions-zero-duties-begin-monday-for-aligned-partners/articleshow/123736960.cms,"PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from Monday to trading partners who reach agreements on industrial exports.The move covers key materials such as nickel, gold, pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals, according to a Reuters report.Since assuming power in January, Trump has unleashed a global trade war, announcing reciprocal tariffs on most major countries around the world. After announcing high tariffs on most countries in April, the Trump administration later used these as tools to negotiate trade deals which it says are favourable to the US.The new directive identifies more than 45 categories of goods that will qualify for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who agree to framework deals reducing Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security law.It also brings US tariffs into line with commitments under existing arrangements with allies including Japan and the European Union. The exemptions for countries covered by these agreements will begin at 12:01 AM EDT (0401 GMT) on Monday.In the order, Trump notes that any decision to reduce tariffs will hinge on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and broader US national interests.According to the White House, the tariff cuts apply to goods that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or where domestic production is insufficient. Officials said the order also introduces carveouts for certain agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented pharmaceutical articles.Once a reciprocal trade deal is in place, the US trade representative, Commerce Department and customs will have authority to waive tariffs on qualifying imports without requiring a new executive order, a White House official added.The zero-tariff list includes graphite and different forms of nickel, crucial for stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries. It also covers pharmaceutical compounds such as lidocaine, used as an anaesthetic, and reagents used in medical diagnostic testing, as per Reuters.Gold imports in multiple forms, including powders, leaf and bullion, are also exempted. Switzerland, a major supplier, has been hit by tariffs of 39% as it has not yet secured a deal with Washington.Other categories benefiting from the changes are natural graphite, neodymium magnets and LEDs. At the same time, the order scraps earlier exemptions for certain plastics and polysilicon, a material vital for solar panels.","Us president donald trump has signed an executive order that will grant tariff exemptions from monday.

Taliban back upgrade in ties as India explores ministerial visit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/taliban-back-upgrade-in-ties-as-india-explores-ministerial-visit/articleshow/123751546.cms,"MEA Spokesperson Says India Maintains Contact With Afghan Authorities Amid Taliban Rule

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed high-level engagement with India, amid efforts by the Indian government to host Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi despite the travel ban imposed on him by the UNSC. India remains in touch with the Taliban for an early visit by Muttaqi.The Taliban head of political office and Afghan ambassador to Qatar, Suhail Shaheen, told TOI there’s a need for both countries to upgrade and strengthen their ties.“For that, high level visits of the foreign ministers’ level is a need. It will pave the way for exploring various fields of cooperation including trade between the two countries,” said Shaheen, who this week urged the UN to give Afghanistan’s seat to the Taliban-led Islamic Emirate.India is likely to approach the UNSC with a request to waive the travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to visit the country, once the dates for the visit are finalised.The Afghan media had reported late last month that the visit was called off after the Security Council denied him waiver. However, it’s learnt that while dates were discussed for a visit by Muttaqi in August last week, these eventually didn’t work out.TOI had reported on August 28 that Muttaqi was likely to travel to India soon, for what would be the first such high-level visit from Afghanistan to India since the Taliban took control of Kabul in August, 2021.India’s ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically in the past few years with the Taliban fully appreciating India’s continued humanitarian assistance, consistent with its historical relations and friendship with the Afghan people. India sent more humanitarian aid to Afghanistan last week after the country was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake.With Taliban not wavering in its security guarantees to India, including assurances that it won’t allow Pakistan-based terror groups to use Afghanistan for anti-India activities, India believes it’s now time to further expand its footprint in the country, despite remaining in consonance with the international community on the issue of recognition.India had already upgraded its engagement with the Taliban as foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Muttaqi in Dubai this year and external affairs Jaishankar spoke to him twice. The visit by Muttaqi will still be a landmark event, as it will signal India’s intention to take the development partnership, which includes over 500 projects spread across the country in critical sectors, to the next level.","India remains in touch with the taliban for an early visit by afghan foreign minister amir khan muttaqi.

"Focus on trade, counterterrorism & Indo-Pacific as India-EU ramp up ties; high-level visits lined up to boost FTA talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focus-on-trade-counterterrorism-indo-pacific-as-india-eu-ramp-up-ties-high-level-visits-lined-up-to-boost-fta-talks/articleshow/123751801.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the renewed push by both sides to scale up ties, the EU will unveil its vision for a new strategic agenda with India on September 17. And as both sides intensify efforts to finalise a game-changing free trade agreement (FTA) by the year-end, the 13th round of negotiations will be held this week in Delhi, followed by the next round in Brussels in October.The EU’s vision document - which is expected to reinforce strategic partnership in areas like technology, trade, mobility and defence and security - will be a precursor to the joint strategic agenda that will be formalised at the next India-EU summit here early next year. Ahead of the summit, a series of high-level engagements have been planned to boost cooperation in areas ranging from trade to counterterrorism and the Indo-Pacific.The FTA is also expected to be formally signed at the summit. As external affairs minister S Jaishankar said last week, the India-EU FTA can help stabilise the global economy. In PM Narendra Modi’s joint call with European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, both sides stressed immediate progress to achieve the agreement this year.The leaders had also discussed the Russia-Ukraine war with the EU saying India has an important role to play in bringing the war to an end.Unlike the Americans though, the EU is not looking to punish India for purchasing, or even “profiteering” from, Russian crude. Its main objective, as official sources said on condition of anonymity, is to prevent such products from reaching Europe. As Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul said last week, the purpose is to not allow Russia “detours” to slip in Russian refined crude products into Europe.On the FTA, while only 12 of the 24 chapters - including SMEs, transparency, dispute settlement and customs and trade facilitation - have been closed till now, both sides are confident a lot of ground will be covered in the next couple of rounds. To impart some urgency into the negotiations this week, European commissioners for trade and agriculture, Maroš Šefčovič and Christophe Hansen, will also visit India this week.“There has been progress in all rounds and now momentum is there to meet the year-end deadline,’’ said an official, adding there’s new thrust in the relationship and that India-EU ties are not determined by others.The next round of counterterrorism dialogue is also expected to take place again this week in Brussels. The meeting will address issues like cross-border and state sponsored terrorism, while intensifying counterterrorism cooperation through exchange of information and capacity building. India is expected to bring up the role of Pakistan-based The Resistance Front (TRF) in carrying out the Pahalgam terrorist attack. The EU political and security committee is also expected to visit India this week.Jaishankar is also expected to visit Brussels for the EU Indo-Pacific ministerial on November 20-21, the 4th such meeting since the EU launched its Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas will also travel to India ahead of the India-EU summit. A meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC), an important forum for deepening cooperation in strategic technologies like reliable AI and semiconductors, is also scheduled for this fall. The meetings will focus on possible deliverables for the summit.","The eu will unveil its vision for a new strategic agenda with india on september 17.

""""I don't think we have anything to say sorry about at all. India has behaved with a great deal of maturity on all of this,"" Tharoor told ANI, noting that even past US administrations had ""encouraged"" New Delhi to buy Russian oil in order to ""stabilise global prices.""Tharoor's remarks came in response to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who claimed that ""India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry and eventually strike a deal with US President Donald Trump.""Countering Lutnick's claim, Tharoor pointed out that larger economies were more deeply tied to Moscow than India.""China buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Turkey buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Europe doesn't buy oil and gas, but they buy other Russian items, so they're putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do.

They can take their own sovereign decisions, we will take our own sovereign decisions,"" he added.Lutnick on Friday took a cue from Trump’s hardline tariff stance warning India to ""stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS, and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff"" even likening India’s position to Canada’s retreat after economic pressure.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said.He also labelled India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" in BRICS, saying, ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""Lutnick's remarks came after Trump himself softened his tone on his social media post, calling India-US ties ""very special"" and affirming his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the SCO summit in Tianjin.Trump said, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship. There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""Tharoor also urged caution over PM Modi’s warm response to Trump’s remarks on India-US ties saying, ""The Prime Minister was very quick to respond, and the foreign minister has also underscored the importance of the basic relationship that is a comprehensive global strategic partnership, which is still there. And that message is an important message for us to give. I don't think we can just completely forget either the 50% tariffs or the insults that have accompanied it from both the President and his staff. ""The Congress MP further warned that Trump's ""mercurial temperament"" and the ""real consequences"" of punitive tariffs demanded caution.""One can't just forget and forgive so quickly because there are real consequences that Indians are facing on the ground and those consequences need to be overcome,"" he added.","Congress mp shashi tharoor said that india has ""nothing to say sorry about"" as it has acted with ""a great deal of maturity"" while criticising the us for unfairly singling out new delhi and pointing out that ""europe is putting more billions of dollars into russia's kitty than we do""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123749861,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39250,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

Poll Do you think the positive remarks between PM Modi and Trump will improve US-India relations? Yes, it will help strengthen ties No, tensions over tariffs remain

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday responded to US President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks describing him as a “great Prime Minister” and a “friend” amid tensions over tariff row. PM Modi said he “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocates” Trump’s sentiments.The remarks by the two leaders come at a time of strained bilateral ties, following Washington’s move to impose a 50% tariff on India.Reciprocating the sentiment, PM Modi wrote in a post on X: “Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership.”Hours earlier, speaking to reporters at the Oval Office, Trump underlined the strength of the relationship. “I always will. I’ll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He’s a great Prime Minister. I’ll always be friends, but I just don’t like what he is doing at this particular moment. But India and the United States have a very special relationship,” Trump said.“There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,” he added.Trump also addressed his earlier post on Truth Social in which he claimed the US had “lost India and Russia to China.”He reiterated his concerns over India’s oil trade with Moscow. “I’ve been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, very high tariff. I get along very well with (PM) Modi as you know. He was here couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference,” he said.The comments follow PM Modi’s recent visit to China for the SCO Summit, amid ongoing trade tensions with Washington.Trump has imposed a 25 per cent reciprocal tariff on India, along with an additional 25 per cent penalty for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India, for its part, has called the US tariffs “unjustified and unreasonable.”Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar also praised India-US relations after Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded to remarks made by US President Donald Trump.""PM Modi attaches enormous importance to our partnership with the US,"" Jaishankar said.Speaking about ties between the two leaders, he added, ""Where President Trump is concerned, he (PM Modi) has always had a very good personal equation with President Trump.

Kejriwal dares PM Modi to impose 75% tariff on US imports to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwal-dares-pm-modi-to-impose-75-tariff-on-us-imports-to-india/articleshow/123747608.cms,"Kejriwal Demands PM Modi Hit Back at US With 75% Tariff on Cotton and Other Imports

RAJKOT: Aam Aadmi Party's convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ""show some courage"" and impose 75 per cent tariff on imports from the US in response to its 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports.At a press conference here, Kejriwal claimed the Centre's decision to exempt 11 per cent duty on cotton imports from the US till December 31, 2025 would hurt the Indian cotton farmers. It will make the US farmers rich and Gujarat cultivators poor, he added.India currently has an import duty exemption for raw cotton until December 31 this year to support the textile industry and lower input costs.Kejriwal said, ""We demand from the prime minister to show courage, the whole country is standing behind you. America has imposed 50 per cent tariff on exports from India. You impose 75 per cent tariff on imports coming from America, the country is ready to bear it. Just impose it. Then see if Trump bows down or not.""He also demanded 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, fixing Minimum Support Price and procurement of cotton at Rs 2,100 per 20 kg, as well as subsidy on fertilizers and seeds to help the Indian farmers.The former Delhi chief minister claimed USA's 50 per cent tariff on India has also affected diamond workers because the Modi government has ""fallen on its knees"" in front of President Donald Trump The Centre last month said its decision to extend the import duty exemption on cotton until December 31 will strengthen India's position in export markets, reviving orders for small and medium enterprises as well as export-oriented units.The move comes at a time when the steep 50 per cent tariffs imposed on Indian goods by the US come into effect, with America being the largest export market for the country's textile and apparel exports.Kejriwal was in Gujarat to attend 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' at Chotila in Surendranagar district, which was adjourned due to heavy rains.When Trump imposed 50 per cent tariff on India, Modi did not increase it in return but reduced it (on cotton imports from the US) by 11 per cent, Kejriwal said and questioned why the PM ""bowed down"" and became weak.India is the world's biggest market and people here stand behind Modi, the AAP leader pointed out.""The whole country is standing behind Modiji. He (Trump) imposed 50 per cent tariff, Modiji should have imposed 100 per cent tariff on cotton. Trump would have had to bow down. Trump is a coward, a timid person. He had to bow down to all countries that defied him. Shut down four American companies and they will be in trouble,"" he claimed.Due to India's policy decision to remove 11 per cent duty on cotton imported from the US, the produce of Indian farmers will not be sold when they take it to the market in October-November, Kejriwal said.""When cotton from the US will arrive (in India), farmers here will get less than Rs 900 in the market. This is what is happening with the farmers -- their (US) farmers are being made rich and the farmers of Gujarat are being made poor,"" he further claimed.The central government first removed this duty for 40 days - from August 19 to September 30. But now it has been extended and removed till December 31, Kejriwal said.""Now, farmers of our country have no way to sell their cotton. The farmer of our country has bought seeds and fertilizers by taking a loan, has paid money to (farm) labourers, now how will he repay the loan? He will have no option left except to commit suicide,"" the AAP convener claimed.He also questioned India's ""helplessness"" in front of America.""Under Trump's pressure, our central government forced farmers of the country to commit suicide, by removing the 11 per cent duty,"" he charged.The other countries on which Trump imposed tariffs responded strongly and the US president had to ""bow down"" and remove tariff, but India did not take any action, Kejriwal claimed.","Kejriwal demands pm modi hit back at us with 75% tariff on cotton and other imports from america.

Pro-Khalistan terror outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation are receiving financial support within Canada, according to the Canadian govt's official report 'Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks', which acknowledges that the extremist groups are resorting to ""violent means to establish an independent state within Punjab, India"".The report, however, said that the monetary support for the pro-Khalistan groups has now shrunk and is confined to small pockets of supporters. ""These groups previously had an extensive fundraising network in Canada but now appear to consist of smaller pockets of individuals with allegiance to the cause,"" it noted.Khalistani violent extremist groups have also been known to use networks to solicit donations from diaspora communities to raise and move funds, including through non-profit organisations,"" the Canadian govt's report noted. The acknowledgment of the use of violent means is in contrast to the description of their activities as ""democratic freedoms"" earlier.The report lists BKI and ISYF, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, in the ""politically motivated violent extremism"" category who have been able to generate funds in Canada.These groups, it said, used diverse funding methods to sustain their operations, including the abuse of the money services businesses and banking sectors; use of cryptocurrencies; state financing; abuse of the charitable and NPO sector; and criminal activity.The report covers all violent groups on how they were able to sustain themselves by finding resources within Canada. Self-financing methods were observed in two prominent terrorist attacks in Canada conducted by lone actors radicalised by ideologically motivated violent extremism.It cited the 2020 incident of a 17-year-old male radicalised by the incel (involuntary celibacy) movement who killed a woman and injured another at a massage parlour in Toronto, using only a sword to conduct the attack. Another case cited was from 2021, in which four members of a Muslim family were killed when an individual drove a pickup truck onto a pedestrian crosswalk in London, Ontario. In 2024, the individual was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and attempted murder amounting to terrorism.The report also mentions Canada's financial sector may be exposed to risks emanating from correspondent banking relationships with institutions known or suspected of servicing Hezbollah or Hamas.Cross-border networks and organised IMVE groups differ from lone actors in their financing, it noted. ""Organised groups often rely on online communities and cross-border networks to raise funds and have been observed to rely on a host of financing methods, including commercial activities, such as merchandise sales; hosting paid events, such as talks and concerts; crowdfunding; charging membership fees; and accepting donations,"" it said. ""Some groups have also been known to engage in drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and theft to fund their operations,"" the report added.","Pro-khalistan terror outfits like babbar khalsa international and international sikh youth federation are receiving financial support within canada.

‘Crap Note’: Navarro Slams Musk After His X Post On India’s Russian Oil Purchases Gets Fact-Checked

Navarro targets India on oil trade



X's fact-check pushback



The US runs a trade surplus with India in services.

The US itself continues to import billions in Russian goods, including uranium, despite its criticism of India, exposing what they called a ""clear double standard.""

India did not breach international law with its sovereign decisions on energy imports.

Navarro hits back — and blasts Musk



Tariff war strains ties



PM Modi's measured response



US President Donald Trump's senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has renewed his attacks on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil imports, only to be publicly fact-checked by X, which flagged his claims as misleading and ""hypocritical. ""The episode is the latest flare-up in Washington's tense trade and foreign policy standoff with India, following Trump's decision to impose punitive secondary tariffs of over 50 per cent on Indian exports.In his latest post, Navarro accused India of driving Moscow's war machine by importing discounted Russian crude.""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins,"" Navarro wrote in a late-night post.Navarro, a longtime hawk on global trade, has made India a frequent target in recent weeks, labeling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war"" and accusing New Delhi of running a ""laundromat for the Kremlin."" He has gone so far as to call Prime Minister Narendra Modi the ""Maharaj of tariffs"" and, in one controversial outburst, invoked caste to allege Indian refiners were ""Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.But this time, Navarro's claims didn't go unchallenged. X appended multiple community notes under his post, correcting his assertions.The fact-checks stressed that India's Russian oil purchases are made for ""energy security"" and do not violate any international sanctions. They also highlighted that:""Navarro's claims are hypocritical,"" one note bluntly said.The Trump aide was quick to fire back, accusing Elon Musk of allowing ""propaganda"" into the platform's fact-check system.""Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russian oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukrainians. Stop taking American jobs,"" Navarro wrote.The back-and-forth comes amid deteriorating India-US trade relations. Hours after Trump's new tariffs took effect, Navarro blamed New Delhi for fueling Russia's invasion and accused it of ""profiteering"" at the expense of the West.Recently, PM Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin, China. In widely circulated images, PM Modi was seen warmly greeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a moment that underscored the shifting balance as Trump tightened trade screws on India.Days later, Trump appeared to second-guess his own hard line. He initially claimed the US had ""lost India to China"" but quickly walked it back.""I don't think we have (lost India),"" Trump said. ""I've been very disappointed that India would be buying so much oil from Russia. I let them know that. We put a very big tariff on India — 50 per cent, a very high tariff. I get along very well with PM Modi, as you know. He was here a couple of months ago, in fact we went to the Rose Garden and had a press conference.""Trump added that India-US ties remain ""a very special relationship"" and stressed he and PM Modi would ""always be friends.""Responding to Trump's comments, PM Modi struck a conciliatory note.""Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties. India and the US have a very positive and forward-looking Comprehensive and Global Strategic Partnership,"" the prime minister said in a statement.","Trump aide peter navarro slams musk after his x post on india’s russian oil purchases gets fact-checked.

The former Supreme Court judge said his candidature is not a “personal aspiration but a collective effort to protect and strengthen our democratic fabric”.In a fervent appeal via a 12-minute video to the electoral college for the VP election, Reddy said, “In this election, there is no party whip, and the ballot is secret. It is not loyalty to any political party, but love for the country that must guide your choice. Each one of you carry the moral responsibility to preserve the conscience, the soul of our beloved nation.”“By entrusting me with this office, you will be choosing to defend parliamentary traditions to restore dignity to debate, and to ensure that Rajya Sabha stands as a true temple of democracy,” he added.Reddy repeatedly suggested that the VP, who is the chairperson of Rajya Sabha, has to be impartial and should guide discussions beyond immediate political concerns and in the national interest — assertions that came in the backdrop of the controversy over the resignation of former VP Jagdeep Dhankhar that has necessitated the mid-term poll.He positioned himself as an experienced public servant whose understanding of functioning of democracy equips him “to serve as an impartial and dignified custodian of parliamentary traditions”.“Together, let us strengthen our Republic and create a legacy that future generations will be proud to inherit,” he said.Training his guns at the BJP-led NDA govt, without naming the party or PM, Reddy said, “Today, as democratic space shrinks and citizens rights come under strain, its our duty to defend the soul of our democracy.”Reddy said BR Ambedkar’s caution — democracy in India is only a top dressing on a soil that is undemocratic — rings true in the wake of “our experience with a regime that has favoured a few at the cost of crores of citizens — Dalits, tribals, backwards, women, minorities, youth, who are increasingly being pushed to the margins.”The VP poll, to be held on Tuesday, is a direct contest between Reddy and NDA nominee CP Radhakrishnan, and the latter is expected to sail through in view of the numerical superiority of the ruling combine.

Allen Lazard's absence shocks Jets fans

Trade rumors heat up with GM Omar Khan likely to act

New York Jets wide receiver Allen Lazard is among the higher-profile adjustments to the regular season Sunday, as the veteran wideout was made a healthy scratch before the team's opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers, an eyebrow-raiser considering his $44 million contract and his place as one of the top acquisitions of the Aaron Rodgers era. Now with Lazard's future up in the air, trade possibilities have started to pop up, and according to Pittsburgh Steelers General Manager Omar Khan , it seems he is looking for something better.Allen Lazard was a surprising absence from the Jets' Week 1 lineup as he was not on the injury report before the game. Acquired from the Seahawks, the 6-foot-5 wide receiver signed a four-year, $44 million deal after the Jets traded for him a month earlier in March 2023, but he has been unable to find his footing with the team.In two seasons, Lazard has caught just 60 passes for 841 yards and seven total touchdowns. Shoulder injury and competition for the No. 2 receiver job have added to the overall struggles of his performance. Although short on talent behind star receiver Garrett Wilson, Lazard was a healthy scratch for reasons not entirely apparent (unless the Jets were more than okay having the nevertheless) and ended up UKG that way.Also Read: NFL game tonight: List of all matches, start timings, when and where to watch and more The Jets made Allen Lazard a healthy scratch last week, and it raised questions about his future with the team. The Lazard situation is a byproduct of a new leadership regime, and Aaron Rodgers is no longer part of the franchise. Lazard's role has decreased, and his contract can be seen as well-paid. Audria is aware of this situation as it has rung the bell of Pittsburgh Steelers' General Manager Omar Khan, a master strategist with roster construction.With both changes and potential changes coming to the Steelers' receiving corps, it appears Khan is considering making a move for Lazard, reports Sayfaneh. With a veteran weapon no longer on the roster for the Steelers, it is possible Lazard could find a new home here to fill a bit of experience and depth within the wide receiver room.With the NFL trade landscape shifting, Allen Lazard will be an interesting case to see how the Jets handle it. But if the team does decide to part ways with the wide receiver, a trade would be the best for both sides, giving Lazard a fresh start while providing the Jets with more resources in other areas of need. Allen Lazard would make a difference in the Steelers' receiving game, adding stability to an offense that desperately needs it heading into the new season.","Allen lazard was a healthy scratch for the new york jets' opener against the pittsburgh steelers.
