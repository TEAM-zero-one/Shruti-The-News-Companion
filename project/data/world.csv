'India is proving it’s possible': US chief calls on President Murmu; praises clean energy push at AI Summit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-is-proving-its-possible-us-chief-calls-on-president-murmu-praises-clean-energy-push-at-ai-summit/articleshow/128632756.cms,"Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive. He urged countries to prepare, protect, and invest in people, noting that international cooperation is currently strained by declining trust and rising technological rivalry.

During his visit, Guterres also highlighted India's initiatives to expand clean energy access and appreciated the country's leadership in convening the AI Impact Summit, as well as its longstanding collaboration with the United Nations across sectors.

At Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Murmu welcomed Guterres’ proposal to establish a global scientific panel on artificial intelligence to serve all of humanity, according to an official release. She reaffirmed India’s commitment to multilateralism at a time when global uncertainties are placing the system under strain.

The President observed that multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations Security Council, must undergo urgent reform to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. She stressed that the existing framework of the Security Council is outdated and that the Global South must be given a greater voice in global decision-making. Reform, she said, is key to preserving the relevance and effectiveness of the United Nations.

While acknowledging that the UN-80 initiative offers a useful platform for reform, President Murmu emphasised that any restructuring exercise must safeguard the developmental priorities of the Global South.

She concluded the meeting by extending her good wishes to Guterres for the remainder of his tenure and reiterating India’s full support for multilateralism and international cooperation.","Guterres underscored that science-based governance could act as an accelerator for solutions, making technological progress safer, fairer, and more inclusive.

As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries, reports Kalyan Das. Members of the diaspora told TOI that many families back home are grappling with grief following recent anti-regime protests and the deaths of loved ones, leading to a marked shift in how the holy month is being observed. Mohammed (who asked to be identified by his first name), an Iranian who has been living in Delhi for nearly a decade, said conversations with his family reflect deep anguish and anger. “How could we mark the month when there have been so many deaths during the recent anti-regime protests?” he said.As Muslims across the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan on Wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in Iran, according to Iranians living in India and western countries.

It is an act of defiance to show the regime that killing protesters has not silenced dissent but inspired more to stand up peacefully. ”He added that videos shared by his relatives show families clapping and singing at grave sites. “Earlier, families would wear black and mourn. Now, many are suppressing visible sorrow and choosing symbolic gestures of resistance. Through that act, they are challenging the regime,” he said.TOI independently verified the claims and came across several such videos in which families appeared to be singing and clapping near the graves of relatives who allegedly died during the unrest.Bahaar Ghorbani, another Iranian living in India, claimed that nearly 40,000 people, including women and children, were killed during the protests. “In recent years, more people have been openly eating during fasting hours as a mark of dissent. Authorities no longer strictly act against those not observing the fast. This time, the mood is even more intense because of the mass killings. Ramadan feels different,” she said.Helma, an Iranian based in Hyderabad, pointed to economic hardship as another reason behind the subdued atmosphere. “Many people cannot afford basic food items. There is also anxiety over a possible war with the US, which people fear would worsen the situation. In such circumstances, people are struggling to focus on religious observances,” she added.In Dec last year, demonstrations broke out across several cities in Iran amid widespread unrest directed at the govt and mounting economic distress. The upheaval was described by observers as the most significant challenge to the establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The subsequent security crackdown involved the use of live ammunition against protesters.Rights groups and activists have alleged that the violence led to tens of thousands of deaths, describing it as among the deadliest episodes in the country’s modern history.","As muslims across the world began observing the holy month of ramadan on wednesday, the usual fervour associated with the festival is highly subdued in iran.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: One of the three US-sanctioned Iran-linked oil tankers seized by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) on Feb 6 off the country’s coast had spent days inside Pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off, according to an FIR registered in Mumbai.The ICG had seized three ships — Asphalt Star, Stellar Ruby and Al Jafzia — around 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai for investigation and lodged a police complaint on Feb 15 at the Yellow Gate police station against nine persons, including the owner of the three ships for alleged illegal activities and smuggling oil linked to Iran. There were 55 crew members on board all three seized vessels.Based on the complaint of Aniruddha Dharampal Dabash (40), an ICG commandant, Mumbai police filed an FIR and arrested the captain of MT Asphalt Star and a crew member for their alleged role in oil smuggling and forgery. TOI has the copy of the FIR.On the ship’s presence in the Pakistan maritime zone, the FIR said, “Electronic chart display & information system data of MT Asphalt Star was examined by Coast Guard Officer assistant commandant P Siddharth Ratnam. It was observed that between Jan 20 and Jan 28, the vessel had entered Pakistan’s maritime exclusive economic zone (EEZ).”“On Jan 28, at approximately 11 hours, the vessel had switched off its automatic identification system (AIS), very high frequency (VHF) and all sensors, thereby concealing its identity and carrying out suspicious movements.Upon further questioning, the master stated that the ship’s voyage data recorder (VDR) system had stopped functioning,” it said. All three ships used AIS spoofing and false identity data to evade detection.Jogendar Singh Brar, an Indian national who is currently based in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and is said to be the owner of the ships, is named as one of the accused in the FIR.Through sustained rummaging, corroboration of electronic data on board suspect vessels and verification documents and interrogation of crew, the ICG specialist boarding team established the modus operandi of criminals.“We have arrested Shyam Bahadur Chauhan and one more person in this case. They were produced before a court and sent in police custody till Feb 23,” said a police officer. Chauhan is the master of MT Asphalt Star. In the UAE, Brar claimed that his ships were providing essential supplies to other ships in distress far from the Indian coast and that the ships were not engaged in any illegal activity, say local media reports.The FIR stated that MT Asphalt Star was found to have illegally transferred 30 metric tonnes of heavy fuel oil to MT AL Jafiza in the EEZ of the Indian Ocean by conducting ship to ship operation without informing any Indian govt authorities. It was also found to have illegally transferred 5473 metric tonnes of Bitumen used for road construction to MT stellar Ruby.",One of the three us-sanctioned iran-linked oil tankers seized by the indian coast guard had spent days inside pakistan's maritime boundary with its tracking systems switched off.

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday said the United Nations joint statement India signed was not a ""negotiated document"" that condemned Israel's West Bank expansion.The foreign ministry said New Delhi's stand on the expansion issue was already expressed in the India-Arab League Ministerial meeting that laid out a broader vision for deeper two-way ties, pitched for a sovereign and viable Palestine state living side-by-side with Israel.The meeting had also stressed the need for conducting international relations based on the UN charter.""The statement referred to was not a negotiated document.

These are traitors...I have only three words for Congress: topless, brainless, shameless.""""Today, they went topless, brainless.

There have been some glitches, but these things happen in a large event.""""What has been impressive is the attendance of Presidents, Prime Ministers, and world leaders, and they've come with a strong message of wanting to see a newly integrated world in AI development, where the impact upon society would be the Principle.Preoccupation in India has clearly led the drive in this area,"" Tharoor said.""As far as the French Rafale is concerned, parts of it are being manufactured in India, and that is a very important aspect of the deal because it is part of strengthening our defence, but also increasing our self-reliance in the defence sector. Defence is important for India not because we want to go to war, but because we don't want others to think that we are so weak that they can be tempted to go to war. It is a defensive defence literally, and I support the government on that,"" He further said.This is not the first time Shashi Tharoor has taken a contrasting stance from the party and commended the government.After India launched Operation Sindoor after Pahalgam attack, Tharoor participated in government's diplomatic outreach to garner international support.","Congress paradox: tharoor lauds ai summit while youth stages shirtless protest at venue.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition on Friday unpacked his fiery ""jiu-jitsu"" analogy from the Budget Session speech, detailing the ""political grips and chokes"" squeezing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a video post on X, Gandhi highlighted the Gautam Adani indictment, plus the Epstein files that mention Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Anil Ambani. He also slammed the India-US trade deal as lopsided, heavily favoring American interests over India's.""On one side, there is China sitting on our border, and on the other side, there's the USA. And our Prime Minister is torn between these grips. He's trapped,"" Rahul said, explaining why he used the jiu-jitsu analogy in his Parliament speech during the Budget Session.""The real grip on Mr Narendra Modi is the fake image he has built, that has been built for him. An image that has required huge amounts of money. The key to that image is now in the hands of the US. And that's why Indian farmers are going to suffer. Indian textiles are going to suffer. We will be forced into buying imports from the US,"" he added.“Why did I use a Jiu-Jitsu analogy in my Parliament speech on the trade deal? The reason I used the idea of grips and a choke is because these exist in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu and it is how you control an opponent in this sport,"" he said.""But they also exist in the political realm. In my experience of politics, political grips and chokes are mostly hidden. The average person can't see them. And you have to look carefully to see where the choke is being applied. It expressed very powerfully what our Prime Minister is going through,"" he added.In a post on X, he raised several questions: ""Why were our farmers sacrificed to please the Americans? Why was India’s energy security compromised by allowing the US to dictate our oil supplies? Why agree to increase US imports by $100 billion a year without a reciprocal promise? Why did I say this deal could turn India into a data colony?""""Why would Modi ji agree to a deal where India gives so much and appears to get so little?"" he asked, before he went to reply ""the answer to this abject surrender lies in the 'grips' and 'chokes' placed on the PM.""""But most important is the data. The fact that our data is being handed over by Mr Narendra Modi to American companies to the United States for a pittance. And mark my words, we are going to become a data colony,"" he added.Earlier, Rahul had criticised the government over the organisation of the AI Summit, calling it a “chaotic PR exercise” and alleging that instead of harnessing India’s talent and data, the event put Indian data at risk while promoting Chinese products.On Friday, members of the Indian Youth Congress staged a shirtless protest at Bharat Mandapam against Prime Minister Modi , targeting the AI Impact Summit and accusing him of being “compromised.” As part of the demonstration, party workers took off their shirts to signal dissent.","Lok sabha sees massive ruckus as rahul gandhi mentions epstein files, adani case; slams pm modi.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Friday hailed US Supreme Court's ruling on President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on different countries and said that the verdict shows that ""American system of checks and balances still seems to be working. ""Hours after the US Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 verdict invalidating tariffs imposed by Trump, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""Hats off to the US Supreme Court for striking down President Trump’s entire tariff strategy! Quite an amazing decision given its ideological composition. A 6-3 verdict is decisive.""""The American system of checks and balances still seems to be working,"" he added.Veteran Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram also demanded that the government must explain the impact of the judgment on the ""deal"" that was announced on February 6 between the US and India.Chidambaram said he had stated that if the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's imposition of tariffs, the result would be that the US and India would revert to the status quo ante of before April 2, 2025.""Meanwhile, the US has extracted several concessions from India without conceding any. What will happen to those concessions? The joint statement announced Zero tariff on many goods that the US will export to India; that India intends to import USD 500 billion worth of goods from the U.S.;that India will not buy Russian oil; that India will address the non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods, and so on,"" the former finance minister said.""What will happen to those promises? An Indian team is now in the U.S. to finalise the text of the Framework Agreement. What will the team do now?"" Chidambaram said.The US Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Donald Trump's far-reaching global tariffs, handing him a significant loss on an issue crucial to his economic agenda.The 6-3 decision centred on tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping reciprocal tariffs Trump levied on nearly every other country.The majority found that the Constitution very clearly gives the Congress the power to impose taxes, which include tariffs.Trump, however, said “nothing changes” in the trade deal with India in the wake of the Supreme Court verdict and responded to the ruling by announcing an additional 10 per cent global levies on items imported into the US.Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him, calling them ""fools and lapdogs”. “The Supreme Court's ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I'm ashamed of certain members of the Court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,” Trump said in a news conference at the White House Friday, just hours after the verdict came in.","Congress hailed us supreme court's ruling on president donald trump's sweeping tariffs on different countries.

India AI Impact Summit 2026: DGIS Harsh Chhibber Stresses Role Of Sovereign AI In Defence

Despite differences, summit has set stage for cooperation: Indian officials

New Delhi: After a week of packed halls, high-level diplomacy and billion-dollar pitches, several national delegations at the India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday, a day later than planned, as the govt works to widen global consensus on the document.The declaration, already backed by over 70 countries, comes amid companies committing to invest more than $250 billion in the country and reinforced India's push to shape global AI agenda for the Global South. Union minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday there was ""huge consensus"", with discussions continuing. ""The declaration and its contours will be shared transparently tomorrow,"" he said, adding that India hoped the final signatory count would cross 80.Countries had failed to reach a consensus at the last summit in Paris but there appears to be greater synergy on several issues, among govts and companies.Substantive disagreements also surfaced on global governance. While the UN announced formation of an independent scientific panel on AI, the US delegation warned against centralised global control of generative AI, underlining the difficulty of forging binding global rules.Despite differing views, Indian officials said the summit had laid the groundwork for collaboration rather than confrontation. ""This is about real action, not just paper,"" Vaishnaw said, pointing to bilateral discussions, industry commitments and plans for an expanded AI Mission 2.0.Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scale and diversity of participation underlined global confidence in India's approach. ""World has confidence in India's role in the new AI age. That is very important for all of us,"" he said.According to the minister, over five lakh visitors have attended the summit and the expo, with ""practically every major AI player in the world"" participating.A key highlight, Vaishnaw said, was the acceptance of PM Modi's vision of ""ManavAI"" - AI of the humans, by the humans, for the humans - which places responsible and ethical use of AI at the centre. ""For the first time, discussion on ethical and responsible AI has been brought to the forefront in such a meaningful way,"" he said.Investment commitments also featured prominently. Vaishnaw said infrastructure-related pledges linked to AI, data centres and allied technologies had already crossed $250 billion, while around $20 billion in deep-tech venture investments had been completed. ""Numbers are important, but what is more important is the trust the world has shown in India,"" he said.","India ai impact summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence saturday.

He described ""democratic AI"" as systems that are ""open, transparent, follow the rule of law"" and function as ""a tool for an individual to scale their capabilities, to learn, think, build, create, produce."" In contrast, AI developed in ""autocratic systems"" is ""designed to enhance the central authority, the authoritarian govt,"" rather than empower individuals.Governance, he suggested, is central to the race. Citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's remark that whoever leads in AI will ""win the world,"" Lehane argued that the values embedded in AI systems will shape the global order that emerges.On oversight, he said new rules are inevitable for a general purpose technology. AI safety institutes are emerging in the US and the UK, with India exploring a similar approach.Asked whether OpenAI would support audits of its advanced systems, Lehane said the company is subject to transparency requirements under safety frameworks in US states such as California and New York and works with safety institutes in the US and UK.He drew a distinction between transparency and disclosure of proprietary information, noting concerns about protecting intellectual property. Baseline safety standards can be developed collectively, he said, but countries should retain the ability to deploy AI consistent with societal contexts.

India's talent deep enough to rival challengers: Gor

New Delhi: India formally joined Friday Pax Silica - the US flagship AI and supply chain security initiative that is widely perceived as an antidote to China's influence over critical technologies. Welcoming India, US ambassador Sergio Gor said that the coalition, which comprises some of Washington's closest allies and trusted partners as members, was about ""whether free societies would control the commanding heights of the global economy"" and would define the 21st century economic and technological order.MeitY secretary S Krishnan, US undersecretary for economic growth Jacob Helberg and Gor also signed, apart from the Pax Silica Declaration, a supplementary joint statement that said this partnership signalled a new era in which the world's oldest and largest democracies stood aligned not only in defence of liberty, but in the purposeful pursuit of prosperity and harmony for their peoples.Together, the two aspire to build an AI future that serves their citizens, strengthens their economies and societies, and refle-cts their shared values of freedom, openness, and the rule of law,"" the statement said.Gor's remarks were more revealing as he said Pax Silica was a coalition of capabilities that replaced coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases. ""India's entry into Pax Silica isn't just symbolic, it's strategic, it's essential.India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers,"" said Gor, who invited India to join the initiative that now has 11 members, on his first day in office last month.For India, Pax Silica is another significant step forward towards the normalisation of the relationship with the US after both sides finalised the framework for an interim trade agreement this month.According to Gor, India brings strength to the coalition as its engineering depth and critical mineral processing capacity offered critical capabilities to the partnership. ""Peace doesn't come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won't. Peace comes through strength. India understands this. India understands strong borders. India understands this part of the world. That strength, that sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,"" said the US ambassador, adding discussions with India were on about building supply chains that would not be held hostage.The Pax Silica Declaration seeks efforts to reduce excessive dependencies and forge new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices, while acknowledging the importance of addressing non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition.Welcoming India to ""co-found"" the future, Gor also said the initiative was about whether innovation happens in Bengaluru and Silicon Valley or in surveillance states that use technology to monitor and control their people. ""We choose freedom. We cho-ose partnership. We choose strength. And today, with India's entry into Pax Silica, we choose to win,"" said Gor.The joint statement prioritised economic security, pro-innovation regulation, stronger physical AI stack and free enterprise saying that the two sides shared the belief that a significant risk facing the free world was not advancement of AI, but the failure to lead it.Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed that cooperation under Pax Silica would further deepen engagement on critical technologies and supply chain resilience under the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.""Technology cooperation remains one of the central pillars of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

Anura Kumara Dissanayake

You are visiting India at

PM Narendra Modi

’s invitation for the AI summit. You have spoken in the past about the gap between States in AI and how some nations are unable to use AI for development because of inadequate infrastructure. In that context, what are your expectations from this summit and the outcome document?

What do you make of India’s focus on inclusive and human-centric AI and the fact that the AI summit is being hosted for the first time in the Global South? What is Sri Lanka’s

position on AI regulation?

Looking back, given the historical scepticism that your party had about India and the Indian government’s recent support for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, as also assistance after Cyclone Ditwah, how has your vision for India-Sri Lanka ties evolved over the past 18 months?

Your government seems to be doing a tough balancing act, as it looks to secure investments from China while not jeopardising India’s security. As Sri Lanka looks to finalise the SOP for foreign research vessels this year, will it take into account India’s concern that vessels with dual-use military capabilities are not allowed to dock in Sri Lanka?

Negotiations for the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement remain stalled. You have stressed economic freedom but given the growing economic ties, do you think it might be time now to conclude the agreement?

In an exclusive interview to, Sri Lankan Presidentspeaks about the significance of the AI Impact Summit, backs India’s legitimate security interests in the Indian Ocean and says Sri Lanka would like to resume ETCA talks in a progressive and transparent manner.We congratulate India for bringing this important AI Impact Summit to the Global South. This Summit is significant not only for technology, but for partnership. Sri Lanka sees this as an opportunity for India and Sri Lanka, and the wider Global South to shape AI governance together in partnership. Artificial Intelligence will define competitiveness, public service delivery and economic transformation. For developing countries like mine, access to infrastructure, research networks and human capital development is critical. This is where cooperation matters.For Sri Lanka, this Summit must be about democratizing access to AI infrastructure and turning global principles into practical partnerships for the Global South. Sri Lanka is already putting in place the foundations for AI-driven development – including a national digital public infrastructure framework, an AI governance architecture, sectoral AI committees, and an AI Champions programme to build institutional capability.We are also advancing initiatives to expand sovereign data centre and AI compute capacity, including engagement with hyperscale cloud providers and development of infrastructure to support AI-ready workloads. But for countries like ours, access to global compute ecosystems, research networks, and advanced talent development remains critical. Initiatives such as the Global AI Impact Commons and the Trusted AI Commons are important because they can help democratize AI resources and ensure that innovation is not limited to a few advanced economies The Summit’s real impact will lie in turning principles into practical partnerships, and Sri Lanka stands ready to work with India in doing so. We’re already building on such practical partnerships, for example 25 Sri Lankan tech startups are being hosted by IIT Madras for a six-week residency.India’s human-centric approach to AI aligns closely with Sri Lanka’s own reform and development priorities. Sri Lanka supports a balanced and risk-based regulatory framework that protects citizens while encouraging innovation. Sri Lanka has already enacted robust data protection legislation, strengthened its cybersecurity framework, and is establishing a structured AI governance architecture to guide responsible adoption. Rather than fragmented standards, regional collaboration between Sri Lanka and India can promote interoperability, ethical safeguards and shared learning. AI governance should enable growth, strengthen institutions and expand opportunities. That is best achieved through partnership. We see India as a natural collaborator in building trusted and inclusive AI ecosystems.The first country that I visited after being elected as President was India; and the first foreign leader that I received in Sri Lanka as President was PM Narendra Modi. In recognition of India’s support to Sri Lanka under PM Modi’s leadership including during the economic crisis, we accorded him the highest honour that Sri Lanka bestows upon foreign leaders – the Sri Lanka Mithra Vibhushana. The link between our countries and our peoples is deep, historic, and civilisational. When I visited India as President in December 2024, we adopted the India – Sri Lanka Joint Statement titled ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’. Relations between our two countries now cover every area of contemporary relevance for our people. India’s support during Sri Lanka’s economic stabilisation was significant. So was India’s support in the context of Cyclone Ditwah. Our relationship today is about structural integration and long-term growth. India is Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner. India is a significant investor, and is also the largest source of tourism. Just a few days ago, we welcomed a large number of Indians who came to Sri Lanka to watch the T20 World Cup Cricket Match between India and Pakistan. We are exploring expanding cooperation in energy connectivity and renewables; digital systems and public infrastructure; maritime security and Indian Ocean stability and security; ports, logistics and supply chains; skills and human capital development and a range of other areas. We are open to considering all possible cooperation. A stronger Sri Lankan economy complements India’s growth trajectory. When Sri Lanka and India work together, it will strengthen regional stability and economic resilience across the Indian Ocean Region.Sri Lanka maintains an independent foreign policy. At the same time, geography dictates responsibility. We recognise India’s legitimate security interests in the Indian Ocean region. Our security is intertwined. We have signed an Agreement on Defence Cooperation between the two countries. Sri Lanka will not allow its territory to be used in ways that undermine other countries’ security. Stability in the Indian Ocean Region is a shared responsibility, and Sri Lanka will always work closely with India to uphold it.Sri Lanka believes the time is right to re-energise economic engagement with India. Global trade dynamics are shifting. India is expanding its trade architecture. Sri Lanka will explore ways to integrate into this growth environment in a mutually beneficial manner. We would like to recommence discussions on ETCA in a progressive and transparent manner. We are expanding free trade zone capacity and welcome Indian investment.Beyond trade agreements, Sri Lanka and India port partnerships offer tremendous opportunities. Sri Lanka’s ports already serve as major transshipment hubs for Indian cargo. By deepening cooperation we can: position Sri Lanka as a logistics and value-add partner to Indian manufacturing; develop joint ventures in maritime services; strengthen industrial connectivity; and integrate more closely into regional supply chains. Economic integration should create jobs in Sri Lanka, and build resilience for both economies. The direction in which we seek to proceed is clear: deeper cooperation with India, structured integration and shared growth for mutual benefit.",Sri lankan presidentspeaks about the significance of the ai impact summit.

However, diphtheria immunity can wane over time, making booster protection necessary. The World Health Organization recommended in 2006 that countries transition from TT to Td, a position later reaffirmed through expert reviews.India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) subsequently advised replacing TT with Td for all age groups, including pregnant women. The shift aims to sustain gains in maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination while strengthening diphtheria protection among adolescents and adults.Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that causes painful muscle stiffness and spasms and can be fatal if untreated. Diphtheria spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to severe complications, especially in children and those with declining immunity. The Td vaccine contains purified tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and is designed to boost protection in older age groups.The vaccine has been developed and manufactured by the Central Research Institute (CRI), which functions under the Directorate General of Health Services. The ministry said CRI completed developmental studies, secured regulatory approvals and began commercial manufacturing after clearance from the Central Drugs Laboratory.Following the launch, CRI is expected to supply 55 lakh doses to the Universal Immunization Programme by April 2026, with production projected to increase in subsequent years.Senior ministry officials, state health representatives and public health experts are expected to attend the launch ceremony.",India will replace the long-used tetanus toxoid (tt) shot with a broader tetanus and adult diphtheria (td) vaccine.
