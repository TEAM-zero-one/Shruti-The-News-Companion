Stop reading history on WhatsApp and rather delve into history books,"" he said, addressing his annual Gudhi Padwa rally in Mumbai.Referring to the recently released Chhaava movie, he asked, ""We have forgotten the real issues of the present time. Hindus who feel awakened after a movie are of no use. Did you learn about Sambhaji Maharaj's sacrifice because of Vicky Kaushal and about Aurangazeb because of Akshaye Khanna.""Thackeray noted that Afzal Khan, the Bijapur general, was buried near Pratapgad Fort with Shivaji Maharaj’s permission, highlighting historical context. His remarks come amid right-wing demands to remove Aurangzeb’s tomb in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, an issue that recently sparked violent protests in Nagpur.He pointed out that Aurangzeb was born in Dahod, Gujarat, and criticized those who manipulate history for political gain. Emphasizing that a nation cannot progress solely on religion, he cited Turkey as an example of successful reform and modernization.The controversy was triggered when Maharashtra minister Shambhuraj Desai announced that his ruling Shiv Sena party had urged the Union government to revoke Aurangzeb's tomb's 'protected monument' status in Khultabad, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.",Mns chief raj thackeray condemned efforts to stir communal tensions over aurangzeb's tomb.

India boosting covert warfare capabilities of special forces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-boosting-covert-warfare-capabilities-of-special-forces/articleshow/119775174.cms,"NEW DELHI: From midget submarines, loiter munitions and nano drones to specialised weaponry, surveillance and communication equipment, India is progressively strengthening the capabilities of its Special Forces to undertake covert warfare deep behind enemy lines as well as counter-terrorism operations .The upgrade in the gruelling combat training, which will include “augmented reality/virtual reality mission planners and simulators” in the near future, as well as “specialised equipping” of the Special Forces in the Army, IAF and Navy is part of an ongoing process, sources told TOI.There are now 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions (each has around 620 soldiers) in the Army, 27 `flights’ of around 1,600 Garud commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.A major shortcoming, however, is the lack of a full-fledged Special Operations Command, which would bring the disparate Special Forces together under a unified command and control structure for planning and executing strategic operations instead of merely tactical ones.Nevertheless, the creation of a truncated Armed Forces Special Operations Division (AFSOD) has somewhat addressed the issue of “jointness and synergy” among the Para-SF, Garuds and Marcos.The induction of advanced software-defined radios, including manpack versions, and satellite-communication systems, for instance, have ensured “uninterrupted and seamless” long-range communications for joint operations among the three forces, the sources said.The Special Forces already have a wide array of specialized weapons, ranging from Finnish Sako long-range sniper rifles, American M4A1 carbines and Israeli TAR-21 Tavor assault rifles to Swedish Carl Gustaf lightweight rocket launchers, Russian VSS suppressed sniper rifles and Italian Beretta pistols with silencers.“The induction of loiter munition systems has boosted the precision-targeting capabilities of Para-SF units. Similarly, remotely-piloted aerial vehicles, nano drones, surveillance copters and lightweight drones with FLIR (forward-looking infra-red) payloads have been inducted for advanced short and medium-range surveillance up to 10-km,” a source said.With stealth being paramount for insertion behind enemy lines, advanced indigenous `combat free-fall parachute systems’ and other such equipment have been inducted, while procurement of new `integrated combat diving kits’ is also underway. “Guided aerial delivery systems are now available to ensure commandos can operate independently behind enemy lines for longer durations,” another source said.Given their maritime role, the Marcos in turn have midget submarines or sea chariots, underwater scooters, remotely-operated underwater vehicles for explosive disposal, open-circuit diving equipment and air-droppable rubberized inflatable boats, among other such things.The selection and training for the Para-SF, Marcos and Garuds, which have a rejection rate as high as 70-80%, also remains a major focus area. The training, in which the volunteers are stretched to their physical and mental limits, includes operations for surgical strikes, hit-and-run missions, strategic and tactical surveillance of vital enemy targets, intelligence-gathering, laser-designated bombings and other such clandestine tasks.The Army’s first vertical wind tunnel to enhance ‘combat freefall’ skills of its Special Forces and others is fully operational at the Special Forces Training School at Bakloh in Himachal Pradesh. “Simulators are now increasingly being used. The plan is to also induct AI-based systems soon to make the training more realistic and economical,” a source said.","There are now 10 para-special forces and five para (airborne) battalions in the army.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari on Friday wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her official capacity. Adhikari accused Banerjee of undermining India on the international stage and bringing shame to the country during her recent visit to the United Kingdom.In his letter, Adhikari claimed that Banerjee’s remarks in London displayed ""devotion and admiration for the colonial masters,"" which he described as ""unthinkable"" for a Bengali. He cited her speech at a business event in the UK, where she said, ""I love UK because we have an emotional relation, historical relation... From the heritage point of view, ours and from yours also. 190 years, you ruled in India. You ruled Bengal... So we forget that? Always India remembers you, and Bengal also remembers you.""Adhikari condemned her remarks, saying that Bengal had been at the forefront of the independence movement, resisting British rule. He said that praising the colonial past amounted to ""public renunciation of the sacrifices made by our freedom movement revolutionaries.""The letter also criticised Banerjee for her statements at Oxford University's Kellogg College, where she appeared to ""downplay"" India’s economic growth. When a speaker highlighted that India had overtaken the UK as the world's fifth-largest economy and was projected to become the largest by 2060, Banerjee disagreed, saying, ""I will differ that.""Adhikari called her response ""simply treasonous"" and an ""embarrassment for every Bengali and Indian."" He alleged that Banerjee had ""deliberately tarnished India’s reputation on foreign soil"" and accused her of opposing the country's economic rise.The BJP leader further urged the external affairs ministry to conduct a ""thorough probe"" into her remarks and ensure she is not granted permission for official foreign visits in the future. He referenced existing guidelines that require the ministry of external affairs to approve such visits and suggested that her remarks should be considered grounds for disqualification.Banerjee's visit to the UK was marred by controversy, as she faced protests from a group of demonstrators at Kellogg College. Protesters held placards questioning her stance on election violence in West Bengal and the RG Kar College case. BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a video of the incident, criticising Banerjee for her comments on India's economic future. ""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has a problem with India becoming the world's largest economy... This is truly shameful,"" he posted on X.Union minister Giriraj Singh also slammed Banerjee, saying, ""Hiding the truth and insulting India, both are done by Mamata Banerjee. Today, the whole world is seeing and respecting our growing economy, but unfortunately, when Mamata Banerjee and the 'tukde-tukde gang' go abroad, they insult India. This is unfortunate.""Banerjee, however, responded to hecklers during her speech, saying, ""Please don’t do politics here on this stage. That you can do with me in my state, not here."" She also defended her government regarding the RG Kar College case, stating, ""The case is sub-judice, also, it is with the Central government, not with us.""","West bengal leader of the opposition suvendu adhikari wrote to external affairs minister s jaishankar urging him to prevent future foreign visits by chief minister mamata banerjee in her official capacity.

Myanmar earthquake: Why a 33-storey high-rise in Thailand collapsed?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/myanmar-earthquake-why-a-33-storey-high-rise-in-thailand-collapsed/articleshow/119720903.cms,"Screengrab

Potential risks to high-rises

Soft Soil Foundation: Bangkok's soft clay soil can amplify seismic waves, increasing the risk of structural damage.

Ageing Infrastructure: Many high-rise buildings were built before modern earthquake-resistant codes were introduced.

Lack of Retrofitting: Some older structures may not have undergone necessary reinforcements to withstand earthquakes.

The recent 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar has left a devastating impact, with over 1,600 confirmed dead and thousands injured. While Myanmar bore the brunt of the destruction, neighbouring Thailand also witnessed significant damage, particularly in Bangkok, where a high-rise under construction collapsed, killing at least 10 people. The collapse has raised serious concerns about the structural integrity of skyscrapers in Thailand and their vulnerability to seismic activity.The earthquake, which struck near Mandalay, sent tremors through Thailand, with the greater Bangkok area experiencing significant shaking. The collapse of the high-rise near Chatuchak market has sparked questions about whether Thailand's skyscrapers are adequately designed to withstand earthquakes.Experts say Thailand’s skyscrapers, particularly in Bangkok, are at risk due to a combination of outdated construction standards and the city’s geological conditions. Amorn Pimarnmas, president of the Structural Engineers Association of Thailand, told the BBC that fewer than 10% of buildings in Bangkok are earthquake-resistant. Although a 2007 law mandates earthquake-resistant designs for new buildings, older structures remain highly vulnerable. Many of these older high-rises were primarily designed to handle wind loads rather than seismic forces, making their ability to withstand quakes uncertain.Compounding the problem is Bangkok’s soft soil, which can amplify ground shaking by three to four times. This effect increases the risk of structural failure, particularly for medium-rise buildings between 10 and 20 storeys, which are more susceptible to resonance effects caused by seismic waves.Experts highlight several factors that could make Thailand’s skyscrapers vulnerable:The British Chamber of Commerce in Thailand had earlier highlighted that Bangkok, though classified as a low seismic risk area, is not immune to earthquake hazards. Past events, such as the 9.1-magnitude Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in 2004 and the 6.8-magnitude Burma earthquake in 2011, demonstrated that tremors could still cause structural damage in Thailand.The 2007 seismic design regulations require buildings taller than 15 metres to be earthquake-resistant. However, implementation has been inconsistent, and many older buildings remain at risk. According to Dr Chusilp, designing medium-rise buildings for earthquakes increases structural costs by 10-15%, which may have deterred developers from upgrading existing structures.","The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck myanmar has left a devastating impact, with over 1,600 confirmed dead and thousands injured.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

President Donald Trump is all set to welcome the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce continue to be one of the most popular couples in the NFL. While the recent events at Super Bowl 2025 might have made them lowkey, they are still very much in love with one another. But it seems like things might change between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift due to newly elected President Donald Trump since the Kansas City Chiefs have now been invited to the White House.While the Chiefs have not issued a statement about it yet, President Donald Trump had once predicted Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s break up.In 2023, in an interview with the Daily Caller, President Donald Trump was asked about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship. President Donald Trump had said, “I wish the best for both of them. I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.”Two years later, while Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have continued to be together, President Donald Trump’s feud with Swift has also continued and gotten worse.The billionaire pop star Taylor Swift has publicly spoken about not supporting Donald Trump. A few months before the 2025 elections, Taylor Swift had publicly supported Kamala Harris when Harris debated with Donald Trump.However, Donald Trump has not held back. He had posted on his Truth Social handle about his feelings for Taylor Swift when she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025, which he was also attending.Donald Trump’s post on his Truth Social handle read as, ""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!""Recently, in an interview with OutKick, Donald Trump spoke about inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House since, due to COVID-19, the team could not make their visit to the White House after they won the Super Bowl in 2020.Donald Trump said, “I look forward to having the (Philadelphia) Eagles (for winning Super Bowl LIX in February). And one other thing, we’re going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that, because they missed their turn because of Covid.”While it is not known how Taylor Swift will react to accepting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, visiting the White House when she has been trolled multiple times by President Donald Trump, it remains interesting to see how it changes the couple’s equation or if it will even have an effect on them.Currently, fans are waiting for Taylor Swift to announce the date for the release of her new album while Travis Kelce has not yet confirmed if he would be retiring this season. Fans are also waiting to spot the couple on their date nights because it has been a few weeks since they were last spotted on their date nights.Also Read: ""He looks pissed"": Travis Kelce’s solo outing raises questions about his mood amid Taylor Swift romance",President donald trump had predicted taylor swift’s breakup with travis kelce in 2023.

Trump Auto Tariffs: Donald Trump imposes 25% import tariff on car imports; Elon Musk responds ‘this will affect the…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-imposes-25-import-tariff-on-car-imports-elon-musk-responds-this-will-affect-the/articleshow/119589320.cms,"Donald Trump and Elon Musk

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","Us president donald trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

SpaceX to launch first human spaceflight directly over Earth's polar regions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spacex-to-launch-first-human-spaceflight-directly-over-earths-polar-regions/articleshow/119783034.cms,"What is it named after?

Who are the four astronauts?



What will the research do?

Why does the Fram2 mission stand out?



CNN

SpaceX is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over Earth's polar regions. The privately funded Fram2 mission will carry four astronauts on a four-day orbital journey.The launch is scheduled from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the crew aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket, with the launch window opening at 9.46 pm ET (0146 GMT).The mission, named ""Fram2,"" is inspired by the famous 19th-century Norwegian ship used for Arctic and Antarctic expeditions,reported.During the flight, astronauts will conduct groundbreaking experiments, including taking the first X-ray in space and studying how mushrooms grow in microgravity.The mission will last three to five days and end with a splashdown off California’s coast.The crew comprises Wang, a Maltese adventurer and crypto company founder (f2pool and skatefish), alongside vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen from Norway, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge as pilot, and Australian polar explorer Eric Philps as medical officer.The crew underwent eight months of training, including an Alaskan wilderness expedition to experience living in confined spaces under challenging conditions.The research aims to help future long-term space missions, including trips to Mars.""With the same pioneering spirit as early polar explorers, we aim to bring back new data and knowledge to advance the long-term goals of space exploration,"" said mission commander Chun Wang.During the mission, astronauts will study how their bodies react to weightlessness and motion sickness, a common issue in space.After returning to Earth, they will try to exit the spacecraft without medical help, testing how well astronauts can perform basic tasks after spaceflight.According to, Fram2 stands out because it involves a unique trajectory over Earth's poles, a route that has never been undertaken by human spaceflight.This polar path demands significantly more fuel compared to conventional equatorial orbits, making it a technically challenging endeavour.The International Space Station's orbit prevents observation of Earth's polar regions. The previous record holder, Soviet mission Vostok 6 in 1963, achieved a 65-degree inclination, while Fram2 targets 90 degrees.SpaceX's private astronaut missions now total five, including three ISS missions with Axiom Space and two Earth-orbital flights: Inspiration4 (2021) and Polaris Dawn, featuring the first private astronaut spacewalk.","Spacex is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over earth's polar regions.

Could Donald Trump actually serve a third term as US President? What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-donald-trump-actually-serve-a-third-term-as-us-president-what-we-know/articleshow/119782747.cms,"Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview

Can Trump legally run for a third term?



America 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits? | History

Are there any alternative ways?



An effort to 'dismantle democracy' or does America 'need him'?



Donald Trump made headlines again on Sunday after he reiterated that he might pursue a third term as US president, even though such a move would challenge the constitutional two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment .“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not joking,” in a telephone interview with NBC News.Later, talking to the reporters, he said that there were demands from the people for him to run for a third term.""I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged. I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go,” Trump said, who would be 82 by the end of his potential second term.Though a third term for any US president would typically be unthinkable, Donald Trump has never followed political norms. Throughout his time in office, he has repeatedly tested the boundaries of presidential power and has shown a willingness to bend or even break the law to remain in office.The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.Any attempt by Trump to remain in office beyond this limit would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously he intends to pursue the idea.When asked if one option could be having vice president JD Vance run for president and then ""pass the baton"" back to him, Trump acknowledged, ""Well, that’s one. But there are others too. There are others."" However, he refused to elaborate further.Nine US presidents have assumed office without being elected, all having previously served as vice presidents before stepping in due to the death or resignation of their predecessors. This historical precedent highlights alternative paths to the presidency beyond direct election. However, whether a two-term president could return to office via the vice presidency remains a legal gray area, The Conversation reported.The 22nd Amendment restricts a president to two elected terms but does not explicitly prevent them from serving as vice president. Meanwhile, the 12th Amendment states that anyone “constitutionally ineligible” for the presidency cannot be vice president. It is unclear whether this applies to a two-term president or only to basic eligibility requirements such as age, citizenship, and residency.If this issue were taken to the US Supreme Court, their ruling could determine whether a Trump-Vance ticket in 2024 might evolve into a Vance-Trump ticket in 2028. If elected under such a scenario, Vance could resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency once again—a legal loophole that, if upheld, could redefine presidential succession.The political leaders reacted differently to Trump's remark with the right-wing leaders favouring the US president while the Democrats called it an effort to ""dismantle democracy"".“This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy. If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term,” Democrat and representative Daniel Goldman said.Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,"" she said.","Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in nbc news interview on sunday.

Trump’s USAID cuts hinder US response to Myanmar disaster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-usaid-cuts-hinder-us-response-to-myanmar-disaster/articleshow/119781619.cms,"The United States has yet to provide significant assistance, with its response lagging far behind China, Russia and India, which have rushed emergency teams and supplies to Myanmar after the devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake.Even as President Donald Trump continued dismantling the US agency for international development (USAID), he assured that American help was on the way after the earthquake struck Myanmar’s densely populated central region on Friday, leaving more than 1,700 dead. As per the country’s military government, the death toll is expected to rise further.Despite Trump’s statement, the US response has been slow. A three-person USAID assessment team is not expected to arrive in Myanmar until Wednesday, sources familiar with the deployment efforts told the New York Times. People with experience in past disaster relief missions said that the delay is unusual and a stark contrast to previous US aid responses.Meanwhile, China has already deployed search-and-rescue teams to Mandalay, one of the worst-hit areas, and has pledged $14 million in aid.On Sunday, the US embassy in Myanmar announced that the country would provide up to $2 million in humanitarian assistance, to be distributed through aid groups operating in the quake struck nation. However, many key systems required to channel this aid have been severely disrupted by the disaster.The situation has been further complicated by ongoing layoffs within USAID. On Friday, as officials in Washington worked to coordinate a response, some received agency-wide layoff notices and were told to go home that afternoon, among whom were employees liaising with aid missions in Bangkok and Manila.Two of those affected had been preparing to relocate to Yangon and Bangkok this winter to serve as humanitarian assistance advisers at US missions in the region. Had those positions not been cut, they would have been on the ground, playing a crucial role in organising the U.S. relief effort.Following the earthquake, the US embassy in Yangon sent an urgent cable to USAID headquarters in Washington to assess needs and initiate aid distribution. A day later, Tim Meisburger, a Trump administration political appointee at USAID, held a call with national security officials to discuss a response plan. However, Meisburger reportedly warned that, while assistance would be provided, expectations should be tempered.No one should expect the agency’s capabilities to be what they were in the past, he said, according to a source with direct knowledge of the discussion.","Despite president trump's statement, the us response has been slow.

He is believed to have planted it in memory of his wife, Rachel, who passed away shortly before he took office in 1829.Trump addressed the tree’s removal on his social media platform, Truth Social, saying, “The bad news is that everything must come to an end, and this tree is in terrible condition, a very dangerous safety hazard, at the White House Entrance, no less, and must now be removed.”“This process will take place next week, and will be replaced by another, very beautiful tree.”He also hinted at a future use for the tree’s wood, “It may be used for other high and noble purposes!!!”The historic magnolia has faced challenges over the years. It was significantly pruned in 2017 during Trump’s first term and suffered damage in 1994 when a small Cessna plane crashed onto the South Lawn, skidding into the White House.","The southern magnolia has stood near the curved portico on the south side of the building for generations.
