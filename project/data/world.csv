Congress slams govt over US advisory discouraging citizens from visiting India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-slams-govt-over-us-advisory-discouraging-citizens-from-visiting-india/articleshow/122059029.cms,"NEW DELHI: Citing the US advisory to its citizens, including women and govt servants, discouraging them from travelling to India, Congress on Tuesday slammed the govt for its “silence” over the issue, saying the US is treating terrorist-sponsor Pakistan with kid gloves while issuing advisories against India.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said this is yet another “diplomatic failure” of the Modi govt. The BJP govt should strongly take up the issue with the US, she said.It is ironic that there is no such advisory for a country like Pakistan which shields terrorists and the Pakistan military chief Asim Munir is accorded a red carpet welcome in the US, while an advisory is issued against the fourth largest economy in the world and the land of Gandhi, she said.Terming the Congress claim as “bizarre”, BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said the US's updated travel advisories have put Pakistan and Bangladesh at ‘Level 3’, meaning its citizens should reconsider travelling to these countries. “Pakistan is ranked worse than India in the advisory. Shame on Congress for peddling lies and acting like apologists for Pakistan. This is not opposition politics, this is betrayal,” he saidCongress also termed party MP Shashi Tharoor’s praise for the PM’s foreign policy as his “personal view.""","Congress spokesperson supriya shrinate said this is yet another ""diplomatic failure"" of the modi govt.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag





MUMBAI: At least 11 persons, including six cabin crew members, felt dizzy and nauseated on an Air India flight from London to Mumbai on Monday, said sources. Air India confirmed the incident but said only five passengers and two crew members took ill.The flight AI-130 was operated with a Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft that's under increased scrutiny following the Ahmedabad accident is Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The cause for the illness is under probe. Poor oxygen supply, which can lead to hypoxia, can cause nausea and dizziness on flights, as can food poisoning.""On board flight AI-130 from London Heathrow to Mumbai, five passengers and two crew reported feeling dizzy and nauseous during different phases of the flight,"" said Air India in a statement. ""The flight landed safely in Mumbai where our medical teams were ready to provide immediate medical assistance. After landing, two passengers and two cabin crew, who continued to feel unwell, were taken to the medical room for further examination and were later discharged. We are investigating the incident and have duly notified the regulator.""A source said a cabin depressurisation problem could cause lower levels of oxygen in the passenger cabin, but then oxygen masks drop from the overhead panel, which didn't happen during this flight.""So, drop in cabin pressurisation is not likely to be the cause."" Food poisoning appears to be the more likely cause, said the source.The pilots of the flight were not affected. ""Pilots get their meal after the passengers have been served. They get the same food as the passengers. Earlier, the commander and the first officer would get separate meal trays, which came from two different kitchens. Serving pilots meals from different kitchens is a proactive safety measure grounded in aviation risk management. It ensures that a single point of failure in catering does not compromise both pilots, preserving flight safety through crew redundancy,"" the source said.","At least 11 people felt dizzy and nauseated on an air india flight from london to mumbai.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The kazmis claim a distant kinship with syed ahmad musavi hindi, grandfather of ayatollah ruhollah musavi khomeini.

'Not leaping to join BJP': Shashi Tharoor on his Operation Sindoor article; clarifies rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-leaping-to-join-bjp-shashi-tharoor-on-his-operation-sindoor-article-clarifies-rumours/articleshow/122052484.cms,"Congress leader Shashi Tharoor (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday clarified that his recent article praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s diplomatic efforts under Operation Sindoor should not be misconstrued as an indication of his ""leaping to join"" the BJP.The Thiruvananthapuram MP stressed that his remarks were rooted in national unity, the country’s interests, and a commitment to stand up for India.“It is not a sign of my leaping to join the Prime Minister's party (the BJP) as some people unfortunately have been implying,” Tharoor said when asked about the article during an event.“It is a statement of national unity, of national interest and of standing up for India, which to my mind is fundamentally why I came back to India after 25 years of service at the UN. I did so to serve India, and I am very proud to have the opportunity to do so,"" Tharoor told news agency PTI.His comments followed the publication of his article in The Hindu on Monday, where he wrote that Modi’s ""energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a prime asset for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.""The Prime Minister’s Office later shared Tharoor’s piece on X.The article sparked speculation about Tharoor’s growing distance from the Congress leadership, especially as it came at a time when the party has been strongly critical of the Modi government’s foreign policy, accusing it of isolating India on the world stage.Tharoor, however, dismissed any such political motives behind his writing. The Lok Sabha MP claimed that the article was focused on Operation Sindoor and the successful diplomatic outreach that followed.""People always tend to see all this in the context of today's news. It is an article in which I describe the success of this outreach mission, which, amongst other things, showcased the unity of all parties behind the matter of vital national interest,"" he said.“So, I said the prime minister himself has demonstrated dynamism and energy in engaging with other countries. He has travelled to more countries than any prime minister, and done so in order to take the message of India around the world,” Tharoor added.Reflecting on the importance of cross-party solidarity, Tharoor said, “And to my mind, what we all did was give his efforts that back up by bringing to bear the strength of all of India's different political parties, backgrounds, groups, religions, and convey to the world that message that a united India stands for. Today it is a message against terrorism, tomorrow it could be a message on something else, but that backing up, I believe, is very important. ”He invoked a familiar American saying to reinforce his point: ""I, too, have believed for the longest time that political differences in our democracy should stop at the borders. For us, it seems to me there is really no such thing as a BJP foreign policy or a Congress foreign policy, there is only Indian foreign policy and Indian national interest.""""I am not saying something new, I said this very many years ago, and I said this publicly, on the record, the very first time when I became the chairman of the external affairs committee back in 2014,"" he recalled.In his article, Tharoor described the post-Operation Sindoor diplomatic outreach as ""a moment of national resolve and effective communication."" He noted, ""It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms.""Tharoor led a multi-party delegation to the United States and four other countries following the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent military operation, aiming to convey India’s position to the international community.His recent comments and writings have drawn attention as they diverge from the Congress party ’s consistent attacks on the Modi government’s foreign policy, particularly over US President Donald Trump’s claims of mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.Tharoor’s stance on India-Pakistan relations and the diplomatic outreach following the Pahalgam attack has often sparked criticism and occasional jibes from within his own party.","Congress leader shashi tharoor said his recent article praising prime minister narendra modi’s diplomatic efforts under operation sindoor should not be misconstrued as an indication of his ""leaping to join"" the bjp. The thiruvananthapuram mp stressed that his remarks were rooted in national unity, the country's interests, and a commitment to stand up for india.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122052580,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33528,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh is now set to be a part of the curriculum coursework at the Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) in Canada. This newly introduced course, offered through the Creative School at TMU, will explore the “cultural, musical and diasporic relevance” of Dosanjh’s work, according to Billboard Canada.Hailed as “first of its kind”, this course will focus on the Punjabi artist and his growing relevance and impact at a global scale. The announcement was made at the Billboard Summit at NXNE in Toronto. The course is set to launch in late 2026.“Toronto Metropolitan University is excited to pioneer a course on Diljit Dosanjh, whose journey embodies the intersection of culture, identity and global music entrepreneurship,"" says Dr. Charlie Wall-Andrews, Assistant Professor at The Creative School at Toronto Metropolitan University. ""His rise illustrates the cultural influence and economic potential of Punjabi music on the world stage. By examining his impact, students will explore how regional sounds shape global pop culture, mobilize diasporic communities and contribute to sustainable creative economies rooted in authenticity”, says Wall-Andrews, as reported by Billboard.Sonali Singh, CEO of Ripple Effects and Business Manager of Diljit Dosanjh, had shared, “His journey represents far more than commercial success. It stands for cultural pride, creative freedom, and global representation for Punjabi and South Asian communities. Seeing his impact formally recognized in an academic space is not only powerful; it’s long overdue.”This announcement comes amid the controversy surrounding Dosanjh’s yet-to-be-released movie “Sardaar Ji 3,” which casts Pakistani actress Hania Aamir. The All Indian Cine Workers Association has criticized Dosanjh and his team for casting the Pakistani actress, as reported by PTI.""This decision comes at a time when the entire nation—140 crore Indians, the government, the opposition, and citizens across all walks of life—are united against Pakistan and standing in solidarity with the families of the martyred,"" the organisation said in a statement.Hania Aamir’s presence in the movie has led social media users to call for a boycott of the movie.Dosanjh is currently on his “Dil-Luminati” tour and is scheduled to perform in France, the UK, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands later this year.","Diljit dosanjh is set to be a part of the curriculum at the toronto metropolitan university (tmu) this newly introduced course will explore the “cultural, musical and diasporic relevance’ of the actor.

2 Air India Flights Cancelled, One Mumbai-Bound Plane Grounded In Kolkata Over Engine Snag

NEW DELHI: Air India said on Tuesday that airlines would ""progressively resume flights"" to West Asia as airspace gradually reopens in parts of the conflict-hit region.The airlines, however, said that most operations to and from the Middle East will resume from June 25.""Flights to and from Europe, previously cancelled, are also being progressively reinstated from today, while services to and from the East Coast of the US and Canada will resume at the earliest opportunity. Some flights may experience delays or cancellations due to consequential impacts and extended re-routings/flight times, but we are committed to minimising disruptions and restoring our schedule integrity. Air India will continue to avoid airspaces assessed as unsafe at any given time,"" the Air India Spokesperson said.The decision to resume operations comes hours after Israel and Iran accepted a ceasefire plan proposed by US President Donald Trump to end their 12-day war that has roiled the West Asia. The agreement followed Tehran’s retaliatory limited missile attack on a US military base in Qatar.Both sides accepted the deal after Tehran launched a final onslaught of missiles targeting Israel, killing at least five people early Tuesday morning.In response, Israel carried out a blitz of airstrikes on sites across Iran before dawn.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had agreed to a bilateral ceasefire with Iran in coordination with Trump.Netanyahu told Israel’s security cabinet on Monday night that Israel had achieved all of its war goals in the 12-day operation against Iran. These, he said, included ""removing the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""He added that Israel also damaged Iran’s military leadership, struck several government sites, and ""achieved control over Tehran’s skies.""The Israeli PM, however, warned that Israel would respond ""forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire”.",Most operations to and from the middle east will resume from june 25.

""The EP route continues to be a key enabler in bridging urgent capability gaps and ensuring timely induction of vital operational equipment,"" an official said.Among the systems contracted include an additional lot of Russian-origin Igla-1S very short range air defence systems (VSHORADS) with launchers and missiles, which have interception ranges of up to 6km.The Army has been inducting these man-portable Igla-1S systems, which are assembled in India by Adani Defence, in batches over the past couple of years.Another contract was for about a dozen integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDDIS) with much-improved capabilities than the existing ones. Both Igla-1S and IDDIS were used during Operation Sindoor, among other air defence systems, to thwart the multiple waves of drone swarms launched by Pakistan.The other deals were for low-level lightweight radars, night sights for rifles, bulletproof jackets, ballistic helmets and quick-reaction fighting vehicles. Several types of drones, including large remotely-piloted aerial vehicles and smaller loitering munitions, have also been ordered.They include around 450 Nagastra-1R kamikaze drones for Rs 158 crore from Solar Defence and Aerospace Ltd and Switch surveillance hybrid mini-UAVs with VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) capabilities for Rs 137 crore from ideaForge Technology, as reported by TOI Tuesday.""Procurements under EP-6 will be much larger and include imports. There will be multiple contracts, each not exceeding Rs 300 crore,"" another official told TOI.Apart from BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, jointly produced in India with Russia, IAF fighter jets used a wide array of foreign-origin precision munitions to carry out deep strikes first against nine terror hubs on May 7, and then at least 12 airbases and radar sites in Pakistan.The weapons included Israeli-origin air-to-ground Crystal Maze-2 and Rampage missiles as well as the French-origin Scalp cruise missiles and Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions.","Defence ministry has inked 13 contracts worth rs 1,982 crore for fast-track acquisition of air defence missiles, kamikaze drones, counter-drone systems and other equipment.

‘China Dialled Ajit Doval…’: Beijing’s BIG Reveal On India-Pakistan Ceasefire | FULL BRIEFING

What is SCO?

Why does SCO matter to India?

NEW DELHI: National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on Tuesday called for ""shunning double standards in the fight against terrorism "" at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) held in China.Doval urged the SCO to hold the perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of cross-border terrorism accountable, in a call widely seen as a demand for action against Pakistan-backed terrorism, reported news agency PTI.He also advocated for a ""joint information operation"" among SCO members to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism.Addressing a conclave of top security officials of the SCO, Doval said India is ""deeply concerned"" about the continued threat from UN-proscribed terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Al Qaeda, ISIS, and its affiliates.The NSA said New Delhi launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terror infrastructure and deter terrorists from carrying out attacks in India following the Pahalgam terror strike.Referring to the attack in Pahalgam, in which The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of LeT, killed 26 Indian and Nepalese nationals and injured several others after segregating them on the basis of religion, Doval said India launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle terror infrastructure.Doval said India's actions were ""measured and non-escalatory.""The NSA stressed the need to ""shun double standards"" in the fight against terrorism and reiterated taking decisive action against UN-proscribed terrorists and entities like LeT, JeM, and their proxies.Doval specifically called for the dismantling of the terror infrastructure of these groups and their supporting ecosystems.He reiterated that ""any act of terror including cross-border terrorism is a crime against humanity.""The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a political, economic, and security alliance founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Originally formed to address regional security concerns, particularly related to terrorism, separatism, and extremism, the SCO has since expanded its focus to include broader cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity, and cultural exchange.India and Pakistan became full members in 2017, significantly increasing the organisation’s influence and geographical reach. Iran was later admitted as a full member, further expanding its regional footprint.The SCO is a crucial platform to engage with regional powers like Russia, China, and Central Asian countries on matters of security, connectivity, and economic cooperation. India views the SCO as a useful forum to strengthen its fight against terrorism, particularly cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan, which is also a member.The SCO provides New Delhi with an opportunity to voice its concerns on terrorism, push for collective action against UN-proscribed terror groups, and advocate for the dismantling of terror networks and their financing structures. India also uses the platform to promote its vision of a free, open, and inclusive regional order, countering narratives dominated by China.Strategically, the SCO allows India to maintain a balanced relationship with Russia and Central Asia while managing complex ties with China and Pakistan within a multilateral setting. The SCO also serves as leverage for enhancing regional connectivity, especially through initiatives like the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and Chabahar Port, though India remains cautious about China’s Belt and Road Initiative.","Doval urged the sco to hold the perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of cross-border terrorism accountable.

'Every Drop of Indian Blood Will Be...': PM Modi's Fresh Ultimatum While Praising Operation Sindoor

Tharoor has 'exposed' Rahul

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor , whose frosty ties with the Congress leadership is now an open secret, has yet again taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the global diplomatic outreach following "" Operation Sindoor "".In an article published in The Hindu, Tharoor said: ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a prime asset for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.""""The diplomatic outreach following 'Operation Sindoor' was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,"" the Congress leader wrote in the article.Tharoor had led one of the seven multi-party delegations to convey India's stand following the Pahalgam terror attack and the military operation.Only last week, Tharoor had admitted to ""differences of opinion with some in party leadership"". Ironically, Shashi Tharoor's latest round of praise for PM Modi comes on a day the Congress made a notable electoral victory in Kerala wresting the Nilambur assembly seat from the LDF after nine years.Tharoor had stayed away from party's campaign in Nilambur bypoll. While the Congress MP had said that he was not invited, the Congress maintained that his name was in the list of star campaigners for the bypoll.The Congress had dubbed the Nilambur bypolls as the semi-finals ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year. The win will give the party a boost as it goes all out to wrest power from the LDF after 10 years.Tharoor's praise for the Prime Minister comes at a time when the Congress has been consistently attacking the Modi government over its foreign policy, alleging that Indian diplomacy is being ""shattered"" and the country stands ""isolated"" globally.Following the Pahalgam attack, Tharoor has made several comments on the India-Pakistan conflict and the diplomatic outreach that are at variance with the stand taken by the Congress party. Led by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress has been questioning the government over US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating a ceasefire between the two countries.The BJP was quick once again to use Tharoor's remarks to target the Congress as it has done several times in the past few months. The party took a swipe at the Congress over Tharoor's article and said the Thiruvananthapuram MP has ""exposed"" Rahul Gandhi. BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, ""Shashi Tharoor admits that PM Modi's dynamism and global outreach are a strategic advantage for India.""The Prime Minister's Office did its bit to return favourt to the Congress MP and shared Tharoor's article on X and said, ""Lok Sabha MP and former Union Minister Dr. Shashi Tharoor writes- Lessons from Operation Sindoor's global outreach.""","Shashi tharoor has taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party.

Blake Lively devastated as Taylor Swift cuts all ties

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Blake Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm, Swift isn’t alone. Travis Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.With Swift preparing to release her next album, rumored to address themes of betrayal and trust, Kelce’s presence has reportedly been “grounding” for the Grammy-winner.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield While the headlines continue to swirl, one thing is certain—this is no longer just celebrity gossip.

After Iran attacked on US base in Qatar, Trump announced that there would be no more hate as Iran got it out of its system, retaliating against the US attack on Iran nuclear sites. The ceasefire that Trump announced faltered Tuesday when Israel accused Iran of launching missiles into its airspace. In this context, Trump dropped the F bomb and said both Israel and Iran violated the truce. He said he was not happy with Israel. Iran denied firing on Israel but explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel midmorning, and an Israeli military official said two Iranian missiles were intercepted. Israel said it refrained from further strikes on Iran after Trump's call.

'Flat-out wrong': White House denies report

A fragile ceasefire





Early US intelligence assessments have cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s assertion that recent American air strikes had ""completely and totally obliterated"" Iran’s nuclear programme. According to a classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Iran's key enrichment capabilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan were damaged, but not destroyed, and could be restored within months.The findings, first reported by CNN and described by multiple officials familiar with the assessment, indicate that while the strikes caused “significant damage”, Iran's centrifuges remain largely intact and much of its highly enriched uranium stockpile was likely moved ahead of the attacks.Also read: What if US bombing on Iran's nuclear sites was effective - and that’s the problem? These findings contradict President Donald Trump who hailed the mission as having “completely and totally obliterated” Iran’s enrichment facilities in a televised message following the strikes.However, the DIA report concludes otherwise, suggesting the impact was far more limited and temporary. Intelligence gathered in the days following the strikes revealed that fortified underground facilities at Fordo, for instance, were not penetrated despite the deployment of 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs.The tunnel entrances collapsed, but the subterranean centrifuge halls were not destroyed.Trump reacts to this report in strong words, calling it an ""ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MILITARY STRIKES IN HISTORY. THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!""Also read: 'Fake news': Trump doubles down on 'Iran nuclear sites obliterated' claim after US intel contradicts him; defends Op Midnight Hammer The White House dismissed the assessment as “flat-out wrong”. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the leaks were intended to “discredit the brave fighter pilots” and undermine Trump’s leadership. “Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration,” she said.Despite these claims, intelligence sources revealed that Iran likely anticipated the strikes. Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, dated June 19 three days before the US assault showed bulldozers and trucks near Fordo, sealing tunnel entrances with dirt. Experts believe Iran may have used these vehicles to move enriched uranium and possibly centrifuges out of the strike zones.Eric Brewer, a former US intelligence analyst, said, “It is plausible that Iran moved the material enriched to 60% out of Fordo and loaded it on a truck.” Kelsey Davenport from the Arms Control Association added that Iran could now operate a covert facility to resume enrichment, though such a move would carry significant risks.Also read: Mystery deepens over Uranium stockpile; was it buried or moved? Vice President JD Vance, defending the operation, argued that depriving Iran of the ability to enrich to weapons-grade uranium was a sufficient military objective. “That is mission success,” he said, even if Iran retains stockpiles of 60% enriched material.While Iran maintains that its nuclear programme is peaceful, prior to the strikes, it was believed to possess over 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium enough, if further enriched, to build several bombs. Iran recently confirmed it has built a third enrichment facility in Isfahan, the status of which remains unclear following joint Israeli and US bombardments.The ceasefire brokered by the US is currently holding, despite accusations from Israel that Iran violated the truce by firing missiles — a claim Tehran denies. Trump, expressing frustration, blamed both sides for escalating tensions, saying they had “fought so long and so hard they don’t know what they’re doing.”Also read: Ceasefire imposed, ceasefire violated but 'war stopped'? : How Iran and Israel disappointed Trump- key developments Trump reportedly told Netanyahu in a post-strike phone call that no further American military operations would follow, urging diplomatic resolution instead. Netanyahu later announced that Israel had achieved its objectives, thanking Trump for helping neutralise the nuclear threat.However, outside experts caution that Iran retains enough infrastructure and materials to reconstitute a covert nuclear programme, though such an effort would now face increased scrutiny and logistical setbacks. As the dust settles, the debate over the strike’s true effectiveness and the future of Iran’s nuclear ambitions continues.","Us intel: iran's key enrichment capabilities at fordo, natanz, and isfahan were damaged, but not destroyed. Iran's centrifuges remain largely intact and much of its highly enriched uranium stockpile was likely moved ahead of the attacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122058568,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-88052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
