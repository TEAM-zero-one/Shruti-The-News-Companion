Why China 'turning off tap' may be another Pakistan bluff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-china-turning-off-tap-may-be-another-pakistan-bluff/articleshow/121607515.cms,"GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma Monday demolished latest Pakistani scaremongering after India decisively stepped away from Indus Waters Treaty - what if China cuts off Brahmaputra's water supply to India? He called it a myth & cited hard data to prove the river slicing through Assam is a rain-fed watercourse that grows in India, not shrinks.""Let's dismantle this myth - not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,"" Sarma posted on X, adding: ""Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream - it is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory.""According to Sarma, China's contribution to the river's flow is minimal, only 30-35%, mostly from glacial melt and limited Tibetan rainfall. The rest 65-70% is generated inside India by torrential monsoon rainfall across Arunachal, Assam, Nagaland, and Meghalaya.Sarma further listed major Indian tributaries feeding Brahmaputra - Subansiri, Lohit, Kameng, Manas, Dhansiri, Jia-Bharali, and Kopili, along with inflows from Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia Hills via rivers like Krishnai, Digaru, and Kulsi.If China ever does ""turn off the tap"", Sarma said it might actually reduce flood devastation in Assam, which displaces lakhs annually. At Tuting on India-China border in Arunachal's Upper Siang district, Brahmaputra's flow is 2,000-3,000 cubic metre per second - but swells to 15,000-20,000 cubic metre per second in Assam during monsoon.Backed by water governance experts, Sarma's post drew strong support from Nilanjan Ghosh, vice-president of Development Studies and senior director at Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata. Ghosh said China's upstream interventions will have ""negligible or almost no effect"" on Brahmaputra's overall flow.Brahmaputra originates at Angsi Glacier in Tibet, flows 1,625km as Yarlung Tsangpo before entering India where it runs 918km - as Siang, Dihang, then Brahmaputra - and finishes its 2,880km journey with a 337km stretch in Bangladesh, before meeting Ganga.Though China has announced plans to build a massive hydropower dam on Yarlung Tsangpo, Indian experts said Brahmaputra's scale and Indian monsoon strength make fears of water cuts largely unfounded.IDSA senior fellow Uttam Sinha, citing peer-reviewed data, said even during lean periods Yarlung Tsangpo's annual outflow from China is far lower than Brahmaputra's total discharge in India.""India’s lower riparian position does not necessarily mean acute disadvantage,"" said Sinha. He, however, believes that irrespective of whether China eventually builds a super dam or not, India must be prepared by building capacity with an integrated approach to storage facilities, embankments, flood diversion, flood mitigation, inland navigation programmes, and monitoring and verifying capabilities of the flows of the rivers that come from China by using superior satellites for flood risk mapping and flood forecasting.He said, ""As the upper riparian state, China is strategically exploiting Pakistan’s position as the lower riparian to needle India so as to serve its own regional ambitions. Beijing is using the Indus Waters Treaty context to amplify Islamabad’s anxieties and indirectly pressure New Delhi, hoping to box India in on multiple fronts.""This is classic China–Pakistan coordination: Islamabad plays the aggrieved party, while Beijing plays the enabler - leveraging geography as a tool of coercive diplomacy. India should see through these tactics. China wants to shape a South Asian water narrative where India is isolated and hesitant, even when acting within its rights.""Referring to the post of Assam chief minister, Anjal Prakash, Research Director of the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB), said the facts dismantle the myth of dependency on China’s flow, highlighting that over 65% of water originates within India, supported by robust monsoon rainfall and tributaries.""The Brahmaputra’s flow fluctuates naturally, and even if China were to restrict its contribution - an unlikely scenario - it could potentially reduce devastating floods rather than harm India’s water supply. This underscores India's resilience, self-sufficiency, and strategic independence,"" he said.","Assam cm himanta biswa sarma demolished latest pakistani scaremongering.

""We had disclosed the targets we hit in the briefings.

The targets ranged from Sawai Nala camp in Muzaffarabad in north to Markaz Taiba in Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba HQ) and Markaz Subhan at Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Muhammed HQ) in south.

"Pakistan aimed to crush India in 48 hours, but folded in 8 hours: CDS Chauhan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-aimed-to-crush-india-in-48-hours-but-folded-in-8-hours-cds-chauhan/articleshow/121607184.cms,"CDS: India accepted Pak's call for de-escalation, but not immediately

PUNE: Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan said that ""on 10 May at about 1am, Pakistan aimed to bring India to its knees in 48 hours"" but ""their operation, which they thought would continue for 48 hours, folded up in about eight hours"".""Then they picked up the phone and said they wanted to talk,"" Gen Chauhan said.He said Operation Sindoor was the first time India had engaged in non-contact warfare. ""We didn't see each other. We saw it either through radar or at different ranges, except for what was happening on the LoC. It was a mixture of kinetic and non-kinetic war. When I say non-kinetic, that happened in the information domain and cyber domain. And, of course, there were kinetic operations where destruction was being caused. It was also nonlinear in nature. So there's something happening on the LoC and something happening as far back as Sargodha.""He spoke about how India networked all its air defence architecture and was using AI for predictive analysis.So better and faster information was available to our side. We also tried to kind of network our counter UAS system, which was countering drones.And in the 7-15 days, we were able to do that,"" Gen Chauhan said.The CDS, delivering a special lecture organised by Savitribai Phule Pune University's department of defence and strategic studies on the ""Future of War and Warfare"" on Tuesday, also touched upon data-centric warfare, which will be based on data analysis deciding cognitive or decision superiority. ""Similar green shoots of that were visible in Op Sindoor,"" he said.He also explained how, through Op Sindoor, India raised the bar and redrew new lines for military operations in response to terror.Referring to his previous media statements about India suffering losses, Chauhan said, ""You should be able to understand what went wrong, rectify your mistakes, and go out again despite the initial setbacks. That is a hallmark of a professional force. And that's the kind of thing we displayed. What I said in a couple of my interviews - that losses are not important, it's the outcome which is important."" Chauhan likened it to Test cricket, where, when one side wins by an innings, there are no questions about how many balls or players played.Gen Chauhan said they would share data on the result of Indian strikes based on technical parameters like electronic intelligence and signal intelligence at some point. Stating that it was Pakistan's strategy to bleed India by a thousand cuts, Chauhan said Gen Asim Munir (now field marshal) had spewed similar venom against India and Hindus a few weeks before Pahalgam. ""But these decisions can be retracted as Pakistan is faced with a different kind of prospect, that it faces military action in case we find terror happening against us. So we have kind of raised the bar. We have connected terror to water and we have drawn out new lines for military operations against terror.""When Pakistan did ask for talks and de-escalation, Gen Chauhan said India accepted, but not immediately. According to the CDS, Pakistan's decision to talk stemmed from two facts: ""They must have assumed that if they continued in this mode, they were likely to lose much more. And the second, since they struck us on multiple fronts, they still did not have the benefit of understanding what they struck and they wanted to talk. It is only after one or two days that they realised that all their attacks against us had failed.""Revealing details of the night of the first airstrikes on May 7, the CDS said, ""We did it from 11.05pm to about 1.30am, and five minutes later we rang the director general of military operations to say that we've done this, we hit only terror targets, that military establishments are out of the purview of the strikes, and we ensured that there was no collateral damage to civilians. We need to talk to each other.""The CDS said war has expanded into space, cyberspace, the electromagnetic domain, etc. ""A lot of activities took place between both of us for four days in the electromagnetic domain. Interactivity also took place in the cyber domain. We also had a lot of activity in the domain of perception management, information, or maybe you can call it cognitive warfare, in which shaping the mind of the people is more important than the landscape.

There are global headwinds like renewed tariff concerns that will restrain a breakout rally. At the same time there are domestic tailwinds that will support the market at lower levels. President Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium is a clear message that the tariff and trade scenario will continue to be uncertain and turbulent. This headwind will impact markets. On the domestic front the tailwinds are getting stronger with the latest Q4 GDP growth data coming at 7.4%, which is much better-than-expected.”“Trends in consumption expenditure and capital expenditure are promising. This along with low inflation and the expected continuation of the rate cutting policy provide the perfect setting for sustained economic growth in FY26.

Pakistan's Strategic Bitcoin reserve plans

Pakistan’s scramble to please US President Donald Trump by establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve seems to have landed it in a soup! According to a report in the Dawn, senior officials in Islamabad have said that cryptocurrency remains banned in Pakistan. The State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Finance both clarified that cryptocurrency transactions remain prohibited in Pakistan, with all such dealings considered unlawful under existing regulations.At a session of the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal explained that despite the recent establishment of a Crypto Council by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through executive order to explore digital asset policies, the prohibition on cryptocurrency remains enforced under SBP and SECP guidelines.According to the Dawn report, Bosal said, ""There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan."" He emphasised that formal legislation would be necessary to alter the current status.Also Read | Donald Trump’s trade policy thrown into turmoil!

"Quad ministers set to meet soon, clear decks for summit India will host",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-ministers-set-to-meet-soon-clear-decks-for-summit-india-will-host/articleshow/121606215.cms,"Quad foreign ministers are likely to meet soon in Washington as India gears up to host the summit later this year. It’s learnt that discussions are underway to have the meeting of the informal strategic group involving Australia, India, Japan either in late June or early July, depending upon the availability of the ministers.The meeting of the foreign policy chiefs, if it happens, will lay the ground for the summit that will see US President Donald Trump, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese travelling to India. With the US keen on hosting it, the meeting will again underscore the Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to the group Trump helped revive during his first term - and which has evolved rapidly to work towards a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and resilient Indo-Pacific – in the middle of Washington’s efforts to improve trade ties with China.The Trump administration’s diplomatic engagements in fact kicked off with a meeting of the Quad foreign ministers on January 21 this year, a day after the president was sworn in for the second time. Quad has remained ring-fenced from differences that partners have had with the US over trade and tariff issues and, in the case of India, the unease here over some of the claims made by the US about its role in the India-Pakistan military clash last month.The meeting will also provide an opportunity for external affairs minister S Jaishankar to review India-US cooperation with his counterpart Marco Rubio in a bilateral meeting, including the ongoing efforts for a bilateral trade agreement.While Russia and China continue to see Quad as an exercise in containment, India believes the grouping’s agenda is constructive and practical, focused as it is on infrastructure, debt sustainability, healthcare, critical and emerging technologies, UN reforms, climate change and humanitarian assistance. And that focus will remain unchanged even as India’s ties with China improve considerably.Counterterrorism is also an important focus area for Quad and a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack can be expected from the meeting. In the past, Quad leaders have condemned the Mumbai and Pathankot terrorist attacks and also called upon all States to uphold international standards on anti-money laundering and combating terror-financing, in line with FATF recommendations.While the date for the Quad summit has not been finalized yet, it will probably take place within months of the scheduled meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) leaders in China in late August or early September. PM Narendra Modi has neither accepted nor rejected the invitation for the SCO summit but it’s unlikely that the event will not see participation at any level by India as working concurrently with these groups allows it to amplify its strategic autonomy. In addition to that, India is also hoping to host Russian President Vladimir Putin for the annual summit this year.","Quad foreign ministers are likely to meet soon in washington as india gears up to host the summit later this year.

'What if China stops Brahmaputra water?': Himanta Biswa Sarma shuts down 'Pakistan's new scare narrative',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-if-china-stops-brahmaputra-water-himanta-biswa-sarma-shuts-down-pakistans-new-scare-narrative/articleshow/121584347.cms,"Poll Do you believe India’s water resources are secure despite external concerns? Yes, India’s water is secure No, more precautions are needed

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday hit back at Pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative, calling it a “baseless attempt” to incite fear over a hypothetical situation involving the Brahmaputra River.Responding to a viral claim, “What if China stops the Brahmaputra’s water to India?”, Sarma issued a fact-driven rebuttal in a strongly worded post on X.His response came as India had suspended the Indus Waters Treaty in a diplomatic move following the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam.“After India decisively moved away from the outdated Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is now spinning another manufactured threat,” Sarma wrote on X.“Let’s dismantle this myth, not with fear, but with facts and national clarity,” he added, emphasising that the Brahmaputra is an Indian river that gains strength downstream, not one diminished by upstream influence.Sarma highlighted that China contributes only around 30 to 35 per cent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, primarily from glacial melt and limited rainfall over the Tibetan plateau. In contrast, 65 to 70 per cent of the river’s volume is generated within India, thanks to monsoon rains and tributaries in the Northeast.Using hydrological data, the chief minister noted that while the river’s flow at the Indo-China border (Tuting) ranges between 2,000 and 3,000 cubic metres per second, it swells dramatically to 15,000–20,000 m³/s in Assam during monsoon season. This, he said, proves India’s dominant role in sustaining the river.“The Brahmaputra is not a river India depends on upstream. It is a rain-fed Indian river system, strengthened after entering Indian territory,” Sarma said.He further argued that in the unlikely event China did attempt to reduce the river’s flow, it could even benefit India by reducing the annual floods in Assam that displace hundreds of thousands.Sarma also pointed out that China has never officially threatened to weaponise the Brahmaputra and dismissed such speculation as fear-mongering.Taking a direct swipe at Pakistan, he said that the country, which has long relied on the Indus Waters Treaty, is now “panicking” as India asserts its water sovereignty.“Brahmaputra is not controlled by a single source. It is powered by our geography, our monsoon, and our civilisational resilience,” he said.The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river that originates from the Mansarovar region near Mount Kailash in southwestern China. It flows through Tibet, enters India in Arunachal Pradesh, and continues through Assam before making its way into Bangladesh, where it eventually empties into the Bay of Bengal.",Assam chief minister himanta biswa sarma hit back at pakistan’s latest water-related scare narrative.

We are a responsible, democratic country and a responsible nuclear power and we have conveyed that to everyone, but if Pakistan undertook an adventure of nuclear size, we are capable of responding,” said Prasad.In London the delegation met ministers, political party leaders, parliamentarians and think tanks. “We acquainted them with the entire terror infrastructure of Pakistan, where the distinction between the military leadershipand terror network is no more in existence and the terrorists do the bidding of the army, and the audience was very appreciative.Pakistan should be made to pay costs. It has taken a loan 25 times from the IMF.There needs to be accountability on where the money is going. India as a sovereign country has the right to save its citizens from terrorism,” he said, ahead of the delegation heading to Brussels.He said 75 years after Independence, India was now the fourth-biggest economy in the world and India’s digital services “were something the world was talking about”. In Pakistan, meanwhile, “unelected generals controlled power”.“Terrorism is a tool of state policy in Pakistan,” he said, adding “we are not against the people of Pakistan. They are fed up with the generals.”PM Narendra Modi went to the wedding of former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s granddaughter’s and in response “got Pulwama, Uri, Pahalgam,” he said.“Osama bin Laden was ultimately captured in Pakistan. A journalist’s throat was slit and the one who killed him has been killed by India’s precise strike on terror camps.”He said Op Sindoor was only “paused” — not stopped — “subject to the good behaviour of Pakistan.” “We believe in peace. We don’t permit a situation where innocent Indians are killed with impunity by terrorists. This is not acceptable.”A BBC journalist asked what evidence India had that the Pahalgam attack was directly linked to Pakistan or its govt.He responded that a proxy of the Pakistan-based terror group LeT, The Resistance Front, had claimed responsibility for Pahalgam. He pointed out that Pakistan army generals and police officers were present at the funeral of a terrorist killed in Op Sindoor and a wreath was sent by the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff. “This is not the first terrorist attack emanating from Pakistan on India. You cannot ignore this disturbing record of terrorism in Pakistan. People involved with the Mumbai terror attacks are in safe houses in Lahore, 52 terrorists have been designatedby the UN in Pakistan. Terror camps are there within Pakistan yet there are none in India and none in the UK,” he said.On Chinasupplying weapons to Pakistan, he said: “India also has a relationship with China. We have a dialogue with them (China), but where you give Pakistan weapons and they are being used for terrorism, for killing people, not in a conventional war, these are important issues and I'm quite sure China will understand ultimately, all the investment and projects in Pakistan are also getting disturbed because of this extremism, radicalisation and terrorism. ”","Prasad is leading the operation sindoor parliamentary delegation to europe to communicate india’s concerns about terrorist infrastructure and activity emanating from pakistan. “we acquainted them with the entire terror infrastructure of pakistan, where the distinction between the military leadershipand terror network is no more in existence and the terrorists do the bidding of the army,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121605921,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-820619,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Tuesday said that ""professional military forces are not affected by setbacks and losses,"" days after claiming that India did lose some fighter jets during Operation Sindoor . However, losses are not important, but outcomes are, he added.""I think, professional forces are not affected by setbacks or losses; in a war, what is important is that the morale needs to remain high even if there are setbacks.

None of the capabilities that we had acquired had been into the battlefield. There is always an element of risk in it, but as they say, you cannot succeed if you don’t take that type of risk. We knew that we had a better counter-drone system,"" Chauhan said.He further said that what happened in Pahalgam on April 22 is ""unacceptable to this modern world.""""What happened in Pahalgam was profound cruelty towards the victims because all of them were killed with head shots in front of their families and their children, and they were shot in the name of religion, which is kind of unacceptable to this modern world. This caused a huge revulsion in society. There was a kind of hatred. It revived memories because this was not a single act of terror against India. Western nations may have had one or two acts of terror. India has been a victim of the maximum terror acts, and almost 20,000 people have been killed,"" he added.He further explained how Pakistan's 48-hour plan to cripple India crumbled in just 8 hours and it had to call for a ceasefire.He said, ""On the 10th of May, at about 1 am, their (Pakistan's) aim was to get India to its knees in 48 hours. Multiple attacks were launched, and in some manner, they have escalated this conflict, which we had hit only terror targets. Operations which they thought would continue for 48 hours, folded up in about 8 hours, and then they picked up the telephone and said they wanted to talk.'CDS Chauhan said that Operation Sindoor is not over as yet, and it continues. ""It's a temporary cessation of hostilities. There is a need to keep our guard up,"" he said.He also said, ""From our side, we didn't want to get into a long-drawn conflict. We've seen our experience in Operation Prakaram. We were there for almost nine months. It involves a lot of expenditure, disrupts everything. We had seen this to some extent after Balakot, there was a deployment which we had mobilised. In this particular case, what happened was that before this mobilisation could be completed, the operations were halted. Operation Sindoor is not over as yet. It continues. It's a temporary cessation of hostilities. There is a need to keep our guard up. As far as the Pakistani side is concerned, I can make two guesses. One, that they were losing things faster at a very long distance, and they thought that if this continued for some more time, they were likely to lose more, and hence they picked up the telephone.""","Chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan: 'morale needs to remain high even if there are setbacks' last week, chauhan claimed that india lost some fighter jets while striking terror hubs in pakistan and pok.

The Trump administration on Monday laid out what is virtually a ""you are either with us or against us"" policy on India, warning New Delhi about buying Russian arms and being part of BRICS group of nations.""That's a way to kind of get under the skin of America...That's not really the way to make friends and influence people in America,"" US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at discussion hosted by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum.Asserting that ""there were certain things that the Indian government did that generally rubbed the United States the wrong way,"" Lutnick suggested that New Delhi was falling in line, saying President Trump ""calls that out directly and specifically, and the Indian government is addressing it specifically.""Lutnick's remarked irked the traditionally non-aligned foreign policy establishment in India, with some commentators asking if friendship with the US requires New Delhi giving up control of its foreign policy and have no national interest outside friendly ties with the US.""India has far greater reasons to feel wronged by the US for decades and even today in some ways. From what Lutnick is saying the condition for making friends with the US is for India to shed its defence ties with Russia and not join any organisation that US does not like,"" noted former foreign secretary and ambassador Kanwal Sibal.Lutnick, Sibal said, ""is ill informed, has not adequately studied the history of India- US ties, and has little grounding in geopolitics.""On his part, Lutnick, one of several billionaires in the Trump cabinet with little grounding in politics and diplomacy, talked up his close personal ties to India and Indian-Americans, recounting his friendship with Nikesh Arora, a former senior executive at Google and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.""(He's) one of my best friends, Nikesh Aurora... When I would go to India, we'd go to house parties, we played cricket, we just had fun, "" Lutnick said, claiming it gave him a different perspective of India.""I am a great fan of India, and even the people in the government know that that's true,"" he maintained while dissing New Delhi for not aligning fully with Washington.In a post on X following the event, Lutnick wrote: We have a great relationship between our countries.

For the first time in 6 years, PM Narendra Modi is unlikely to be a part of the G7 summit that is being hosted this year by Canada June15-17. There’s no official invitation yet from Canada for the meeting in Alberta but Modi in all likelihood would not have travelled to the North American country in any case, especially when India still isn’t sure the new government in Ottawa will be more receptive to its concerns about the activities of Khalistan separatists.A Canadian G7 spokesperson didn’t confirm to TOI late on Sunday if Modi was going to be invited.Any eleventh-hour invitation is unlikely to be considered by India because of logistical constraints, likely efforts by the separatists to disrupt the visit and the strained bilateral ties that both Modi and his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney have committed to improve. A bilateral meeting on the margins could have provided an opportunity for the leaders to jointly reaffirm their commitment to rebuilding ties.Canada hasn’t officially announced the names of the guest leaders for the summit, which will see the heads of government of major world economies in attendance, but reports in the Canadian media say Ottawa has invited the leaders of Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Ukraine and Brazil. This will be the first time that he won’t be at the meeting of the economically most advanced group of nations since France invited him for the summit in 2019.His presence at the summit of what is also an informal grouping of like-minded democracies has been seen as a sign of India’s growing role in shaping up the global agenda and addressing transnational issues.The Sikh separatists last week called upon the Carney government to not invite the Indian PM, citing India’s alleged reluctance to cooperate in the investigations into the killing of separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau blamed the Indian government for the murder without backing up his claim, as Indian has repeatedly said, with any evidence. The diplomatic row that followed saw the relationship hitting an all-time low as both sides expelled each other’s diplomats for activities hostile to the host nation.Carney has so far not explicitly spoken on the Nijjar issue but, while talking about his plans to use trade to reset ties, has said that Canada is not responsible for the strain on the relationship with India. India is hoping that Carney will act more responsibly than Trudeau in his handling of the case and has said it is ready to work with Ottawa based on mutual trust and sensitivity. India wants Canada to ensure foolproof security for Indian diplomats and also crack down on extremists and secessionists indulging in anti-India activities.",Pm narendra modi is unlikely to be a part of the g7 summit that is being hosted this year by canada june15-17.

'Op Sindoor Is Not...': Salman Khurshid's Big Statement In Malaysia As Delegation Visit Concludes

'National interest sacrificed at the altar of political expediency'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Monday sent a strong message to ""people at home"" over political allegiances, even as his recent remarks on Article 370 appeared to deepen discomfort within his party.Khurshid expressed concern over political divisions in India, even as a multi-party delegation travels abroad to highlight the country’s united stand against terrorism . Khurshid, a senior politician and former foreign minister, is currently in East Asia as part of an all-party parliamentary group led by JD(U) MP Sanjay Kumar Jha.Posting on X, Khurshid wrote, “When on mission against terrorism, to carry India’s message to the world, it’s distressing that people at home are calculating political allegiances. Is it so difficult to be patriotic?”The post came days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cornered Congress over Khurshid's remark backing abrogation of Article 370. While addressing think tanks and academia in Indonesia on last week, Khurshid said it was unfortunate that Pakistan wants to undo the prosperity that has come to Jammu & Kashmir following the abrogation. Khurshid is part of one of the seven- all party delegations currently touring various countries.The Congress had initially opposed the move to scrap Article 370. The party later nuanced its position and has since been ambivalent on the issue of restoration of the Article which granted J&K special status.""Kashmir had a major problem for a long time. Much of that was reflected in the thinking of the government in an article called 370 of the Constitution, which somehow gave the impression that it was separate from the rest of the country. But Article 370 was abrogated, it was finally put to an end, because so much time had passed,"" Khurshid had said.The BJP jumped on the opportunity and questioned whether the Congress would now target senior leader Salman Khurshid for what it called “speaking an inconvenient truth” like party leader Shashi Tharoor who faced backlash from within the grand-old party for supporting the Centre over Operation Sindoor stance.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya responded to Khurshid's post, calling it ""both tragic and deeply ironic."" He criticised the Congress for ""sacrificing national interest at the altar of political expediency,"" accusing the party of placing ""partisan interests above the country’s welfare.""""The sentiment expressed here is both tragic and deeply ironic. It reflects the cost of a warped idea of secularism that the Congress party has long championed, one that confuses the urgent need to confront terror with a compulsive instinct to appease. In doing so, they have not only diluted the moral clarity required to fight extremism, but have also compromised national security in the name of vote-bank politics,"" Mavliya wrote in a post on X.Earlier, in a similar messaging, Khurshid on Saturday had said, ""The ruling party could have come alone to bring this message, but they came with us to give India's message... However, sadly, this is not what we hear from India. Somebody is saying that he is supporting the BJP or the Congress, but I am proud that we are here together because we are not supporting , we are supporting one simple idea called India.""Also read: 'Ridiculous Rahul': BJP slams Congress after Salman Khurshid Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who is part of another delegation currently in Brazil and facing opposition by own party members, had made similar remarks.

But for now, we should focus on the mission,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress has raised questions on the ceasefire with Paistan after Operation Sindoor. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge and spokesperson Pawan Khera have demanded a Parliament session to get clarity on the terms of the ceasefire with Pakistan. They have accused the government of misleading the nation after retaliatory strikes in response to the terror attack in Pahalgam.","Khurshid expressed concern over political divisions in india, even as a multi-party delegation travels abroad to highlight the country’s united stand against terrorism.
