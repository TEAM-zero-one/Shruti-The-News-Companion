NEW DELHI: A team of Indian officials led by commerce secretary Rajesh Agarwal is once again headed to the US for talks on the proposed bilateral trade deal, amid indications that Trump administration is keen to move ahead.Officials indicated that delegation would visit Washington this week itself as the two sides seek to thrash out a deal in a few weeks. The move comes just a day after US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor met PM Modi and held discussions with Agrawal. “During my visit to India, I met with commerce secretary Agrawal & discussed US-India economic ties, including increased investment in US,” Gor posted on X Sunday.US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor’s post indicates Trump administration is also nudging Indian companies to commit to investing in the US, a move meant to strengthen the President’s claims that his tariff actions and negotiations with countries have resulted in investment commitments that add up to $17 trillion, a number that is facing scrutiny.While some Indian IT companies are looking to set up offices and hire more locally, a handful of Indian players have invested in the US.So far, the discussions were focused largely on India slashing import duties, including on farm products, in return for getting a favourable “reciprocal tariff” for its exports. Besides, Trump has cited India’s purchase of Russian crude to impose a crushing 50% tariff, which has hurt Indian textiles, gems and jewellery and leather and footwear players.The 25% reciprocal tariff on India, which came after Indian negotiators held their ground on not allowing American corn and soybean and genetically modified food, is higher than several competitor countries. Govt is seeking that the 25% “secondary tariffs”, for purchase of Russian oil be dropped, while indicating that it is open to purchase more American oil and gas to help narrow the trade surplus that India currently enjoys.",A team of indian officials led by commerce secretary rajesh agarwal is once again headed to the us for talks on the proposed bilateral trade deal.

"India, Canada draw roadmap to revive ties amid global flux",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-canada-draw-roadmap-to-revive-ties-amid-global-flux/articleshow/124541094.cms,"Taking our job to protect diplomats seriously: Anand

New Delhi, Ottawa strengthen missions to boost biz & trade

NEW DELHI: India and Canada took a major step forward to normalise their relationship as foreign minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart, Anita Anand, announced Monday a roadmap comprising a slew of initiatives to boost cooperation while underlining the significance of a law enforcement dialogue in addressing each other’s security concerns.In a rare India-Canada joint statement, the ministers sought constructive and balanced partnership grounded in respect for each other’s concerns and sensitivities and growing economic complementarities.Anand, who is travelling to Mumbai as well during her first visit to India as foreign minister, was welcomed by PM Modi for a meeting as the bilateral relationship continues to thaw. PM Modi recalled his “extremely productive” huddle with counterpart Mark Carney on the margins of the G7 summit in Canada in June. “Discussed ways to strengthen cooperation in trade, technology, energy, agriculture and people-topeople exchanges for mutual growth and prosperity (with Anand),” PM Modi posted on X.Canada is taking every step to ensure the security of its citizens on its soil, foreign minister Anita Anand said when asked about India’s concerns regarding the activities of Khalistan separatists and its seeking the return of individuals it designates as terrorists. On the safety of foreign diplomats, she said Ottawa takes its job of protecting them “very very seriously”.On the progress of a probe into the murder of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, she said, “Canadians have the right to feel safe and secure in our country, and that’s the purpose of the law enforcement dialogue (with India).”PM Modi said he was looking forward to his upcoming engagements with Carney. The Canadian PM has been invited by India for the AI summit it will host next year.As both sides look to fend off possible damages from US tariff policies, they announced in the statement commencement, at an early date, of ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade and investment “informed by today’s economic realities and each country’s strategic priorities”. While both sides have expressed interest in resuming talks for a trade deal, they will likely have to wait for a meeting of the trade ministers to move forward on it.There was focus on security as well in the joint statement, titled ‘Renewing Momentum Towards a Stronger Partnership’, as both sides, based on mutual respect for shared democratic values, the rule of law and a commitment to upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity reached consensus on the roadmap. Jaishankar described the recent meeting between the two sides to enhance cooperation as positive.“India-Canada bilateral relations have been steadily progressing in the last few months. We are working to restore and reinvigorate the mechanisms necessary to advance our partnership,” said Jaishankar, adding that India sees in Canada a complementary economy, open society, diversity & pluralism.The ministers recognised that in the context of ongoing global economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions, a strong and resilient India-Canada bilateral relationship is essential, according to the statement. “Reviving this partnership will not only create opportunities for enhanced economic cooperation but also help mitigate vulnerabilities arising from shifting global alliances, ensure more reliable supply chains, and reinforce strategic stability in an increasingly complex international environment,” it said.There was focus also on how Canada’s mining expertise can provide India with critical minerals needed for energy security and both sides welcomed ongoing talks in civil nuclear cooperation.To facilitate business and people-to-people contacts, India and Canada also agreed to increase the strength of the respective missions, saying institutional capacity will be strengthened by progressively deploying expertise in the economic, political, defence and technology domains. “These efforts will contribute to rebuilding trust and deepening cooperation between the two countries,” said the ministers.Looking to tap growing opportunities in goods, services and investment, both sides agreed to resume the Canada–India CEO Forum. Both countries said the forum will bring together leading business executives from both countries to identify “concrete, actionable recommendations” to facilitate increased bilateral trade and investments. The forum will focus on opportunities in clean technology, infrastructure, agri-food, and digital innovation.","New delhi, ottawa strengthen missions to boost biz & trade.

"‘On public safety, rule of law paramount in Canada’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-public-safety-rule-of-law-paramount-in-canada/articleshow/124541014.cms,"How has your visit helped to carry forward the reset in the relationship?

How can India and Canada work together in trade to offset likely damages from the US tariff war? Are you looking at restarting negotiations for a trade deal?

So you are not restarting talks for a trade agreement?

On the security issue, India remains concerned about the activities of Khalistan separatists, safety and security of diplomats and seeks return of individuals it has designated as terrorists. Will Canada be more receptive to these concerns?

How has the probe in the murder of a Khalistan separatist in 2023 progressed?

PM Carney

said in June both sides have agreed to have law enforcement dialogue recognising ""issues of accountability"". How is this dialogue going?

I use the word elevate. We're moving our relationship to a stronger base. We're elevating the areas in which we are cooperating. We are making sure that we work together on law enforcement and security. In addition, in the joint statement, we're not only cooperating on issues relating to security, but we're also taking a bilateral cooperative effort on energy, on artificial intelligence, on agriculture, on issues relating to climate change and environmental sustainability. So, the joint statement is extremely important because it sets the framework for the work that both of our countries will be doing on a step-by-step basis going into the future.And if I could, I just want to underline the importance of the joint statement. There hasn't been a joint statement in recent memory, dating well before the pandemic between Canada and India. This joint statement itself is an indication of the cooperative spirit in which the two countries are moving, having recognition of the importance of the security enforcement dialogue. I came here to sign and finalise the joint statement, and that's exactly what we've done.The first question relates to the changing geopolitical and trade environment that we are finding, generally speaking, in the world. And as a result of some volatility economically and in the area of trade, all countries are examining how they can increase their supply chains and reinforce their trading relationships. That is true for Canada. That appears to be true as well for India. This is a moment of introspection, in fact, to ensure that we domestically, from a Canadian standpoint, are doing whatever we can to further our links with other trading partners.That is occurring against the backdrop of our negotiations with the US, but recognising that we're the only G7 country that has a free trade agreement with every other G7 country, and we want to do more. The joint statement, therefore, represents the continued work that we will do on trade. And here I'm moving to your second question. The joint statement speaks of enhancing bilateral trade and cooperation in order to ensure greater economic growth and resilience.And we're going to restart Canada-India CEO Forum. We're going to commence ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade and investment. And in that vein, I spoke not only with EAM Jaishankar today, but also Piyush Goyal (commerce minister) on the trade side.This is not restarting the FTA negotiations. This is affirming trade as a cornerstone of bilateral growth and resilience in trade. So you'll recall that what I said earlier this year was that Canada will be taking a systematic, step-by-step approach to ensuring that the relationship with India is on track while maintaining the security dialogue that is occurring at the official's level. And that's exactly what's happening.So, Canada is taking every step necessary to ensure the safety and security of Canadian citizens on Canadian soil. There is an RCMP probe that is occurring. At the same time, we are having in place law enforcement dialogue with India. And that is a dialogue that is ongoing. My deputy minister, David Morrison, as well as Nathalie Drouin (national security and intelligence adviser) were here in India just a few weeks ago to continue that conversation with India. It's ongoing. It's based on a cooperative view that law enforcement is an important issue, and that's why it is mentioned not only in the joint statement. In addition to that, we need to examine the other areas where the Canada-India relationship can grow. And that's why we're talking about trade, AI, energy, climate, and people-to-people ties, as well as business-to-business ties.n The purpose of the law enforcement dialogue is to ensure that each country is able to put its concerns on the table so that they are addressed by the other country. I can speak from the Canadian standpoint. First, regardless of political views, sovereignty and the rule of law are going to be paramount in Canada in terms of public safety. Second, the RCMP has a responsibility to protect diplomats from all countries, and they take this job very, very seriously. Canadians have the right to feel safe and secure in our country, and that is the purpose of the law enforcement dialogue that we are continuing.When you say you will follow a step-by-step approach with India, are you linking the rebuilding of ties to progress in the investigations?n So, it's important to think of this occurring on two tracks. The first track is the law enforcement dialogue that is occurring between officials from both countries on an ongoing basis. And I will add that these are senior officials that are charged with ensuring that the law enforcement concerns of each country are tabled and addressed. That will continue. The second track is the contents of the joint statement over and above security, enforcement, and cooperation. In addition to the security dialogue, we're elevating the number of areas in which Canada and India are working, from energy to trade to AI to climate change to people-to-people ties and business-to-business ties.Is PM Carney likely to visit India anytime soon, maybe for the AI summit?n There are no confirmed dates for any visit from our PM at this point. I want to say, however, that he was very pleased to welcome PM Modi to Kananaskis in June 2025. And they are looking forward, from my understanding, to meeting again soon.",Pm carney: we're moving our relationship to a stronger base. We're elevating the areas in which we are cooperating.

He cited Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.The new US tariffs, along with export controls on ""any and all critical software,"" are set to take effect from November 1. Trump described Beijing’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive"" and said, ""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'.""Currently, Chinese goods face 30% US tariffs, while Beijing’s retaliatory duties stand at 10%.The announcement sent Wall Street into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq dropping more than three percent.Investors were already cautious after a recent surge in tech stocks had raised fears of a market bubble.The latest tensions came after months of fragile peace between the two economic giants, who had been negotiating a full trade deal following Trump’s tariff announcements in April. That earlier round had led to escalating tit-for-tat levies.Meanwhile, Trump’s Sunday comments gave a small boost to US futures, which rose more than one percent.Gold, often seen as a safe-haven during uncertainty, continued to climb, hitting a new record of $4,060. Oil also bounced back after Friday’s slump, which had been worsened by Trump’s remarks and eased by news of the Israel-Hamas peace deal calming supply concerns.","Hong kong's hsi traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%.

CHANDIGARH: In past few weeks, security agencies manning anti-drone systems along Punjab border began noticing a strange trend - drones from Pakistan would be detected and tracked, but would whirr back behind the fence before they could be brought down.ISI-backed smugglers in Pakistan routinely try to send arms, including AK-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with Punjab. There was a lull in the immediate aftermath of Operation Sindoor, but it picked up after a few weeks. Detection and interception also rose on the Indian side as the three anti-drone systems (ADS) were strengthened.Now, these new drones have upped the cat-and-mouse game. ""Technology changes every day. What is happening now is that drones coming from Pakistan are largely programmed with a fail-safe mechanism with default settings of back-to-home. After sensing disruption in the signal between the drone and base station during our attempts to jam, lock, and neutralise them, the drones are programmed to return to the point where they took off,"" said a senior Punjab Police officer, describing it as ""a tech challenge"" in Punjab's war against Pakistan's ISI-backed smuggling network.The Indian anti-drone systems are up to the task as most attempts to smuggle arms and drugs via drones get detected, the officer said. ""The drones are either brought down or fly back across the border. Either way, it's foiled,"" he added. ""The detection rate is very high, eight or 10 a day, sometimes even 15,"" he said, adding: ""We need at least 100 such ADS for wider coverage of border areas.""Amid its ongoing 'Yudh Nashian Virudh', Punjab government deployed 3 vehicle-mounted ADS in the first phase, with an official launch by Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal in Tarn Taran on August 9. Punjab plans to deploy nine such systems at a total cost of around Rs 51 crore.Since deployment of ADS, Tarn Taran police have registered 12 FIRs and arrested as many suspects in Bhikhiwind subdivision alone for receiving contraband via drones. The haul includes four pistols, 75 bullets, five magazines, over 3kg heroin, 492g ICE, and 506g opium.Bhikhiwind DSP Preetinder Singh said: ""ADS has proved very effective in combating smuggling of drugs and weapons from Pakistan via drones. Earlier, we had to rely on sound to track drones. This technology gives us exact coordinates of the drone along with speed, altitude and other parameters."" ""Up to a certain range and distance, jamming can neutralise the drone. But sometimes, the drone is at such a distance that jamming is ineffective, even though it can be detected. Detection has helped us make recoveries and arrests,"" the DSP added.","Isi-backed smugglers in pakistan routinely try to send arms, including ak-47s and grenades, and drugs, slung under drones, across the 532km-long border with punjab.

Pakistan thought it could do anything with nuclear capability, but Operation Sindoor proved it wrong. The new normal’s impact was visible on Pakistan — we outperformed it in every field, including sports,” General Chauhan said while addressing students at the 128th Foundation Day celebrations of Scindia School in Gwalior.He emphasised that a war is not fought by armed forces alone but by the entire nation, with political leaders, diplomats and soldiers all playing critical roles.“Operation Sindoor created a new matrix of decision and timing in warfare. Many challenges still lie ahead for the armed forces. No war is fought by the armed forces alone; the whole nation fights it. Leaders, diplomats and soldiers know their roles,” he said, as quoted by PTI.General Chauhan explained that Operation Sindoor, which involved precision air strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK, established a “new normal” — that “talks and terrorism cannot go hand in hand.”He underlined the broader responsibility of citizens, saying nation-building is a collective effort. “The future belongs to India. The coming era belongs to India, and we, the 140 crore people of this country, can achieve this together,” he said, urging the youth to actively contribute during “Amrit Kaal.”Union minister and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, alumni and parents of students attended the event held at the Gwalior Fort, reported PTI.",Chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan recalls operation sindoor.

NEW DELHI: A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who left their homeland over the decades in the face of persecution and took refuge in India met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday and requested that the current regime in Afghanistan facilitate a joint delegation of prominent Hindus and Sikhs leaders from India for the restoration and maintenance of historical gurdwaras and temples located there.The delegation is learnt to have also sought easing of requirements for Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who are now Indian nationals so that they can visit like before without having to apply for a visa, as many would want to go back for business if the regime there ensures safety for minorities.They also sought that the Afghanistan government (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) must consider appointing and engaging Afghan national Hindus or Sikhs in their mission in India too, as this will strengthen the bilateral relations.“As during the previous regime, minorities were given representation in the government and considering the same, at least two persons - one each from the Hindu and Sikh community should be appointed to high-ranking positions in the government,” the delegation conveyed as per a statement issued after the meeting. They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi. While most have acquired Indian citizenship, there would still be around 2,000 people who are Afghan nationals.The exodus over the decades has led a large number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to India and from here to various other countries like the United States, Canada, UK and Germany among other countries.",Afghan hindus and sikhs meet foreign minister muttaqi at the afghan embassy in delhi.

"India going for German-origin submarines, may scrap project for more French ones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-likely-to-scrap-french-scorpene-project-may-go-for-german-origin-subs/articleshow/124540593.cms,"NEW DELHI: India may scrap the proposed project to build another three French-origin Scorpene submarines at Mazagon Docks (MDL), while it goes full steam ahead with the plan to construct six new German-origin diesel-electric stealth submarines at the same facility for over Rs 70,000 crore.The plan for the three additional Scorpene submarines, which would have cost around Rs 36,000 crore, “is not being pursued now”, though the “final decision to scrap it has not yet been taken in black and white”, top govt sources have told TOI.While cost negotiations for the three more Scorpenes concluded in the last fiscal itself, the final nod from the PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) is “on hold” because the German submarines are considered “a generation ahead” of them, the sources added.“Moreover, it would be difficult for MDL to handle two different complex submarine-building projects simultaneously,” a source said. The three new Scorpenes were to add to the six such submarines already built at MDL under the over Rs 23,000 crore `Project-75’, which was inked way back in Oct 2005.The first, INS Kalvari, was commissioned in Dec 2017 after much delay and the sixth, INS Vagsheer, in Jan this year. All the six Kalvari-class submarines will, however, be retrofitted with the air-independent propulsion (AIP) system being developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.AIP gives a diesel-electric submarine the stealth capability to remain underwater for around two weeks, while a boat without it must surface or `snorkel’ every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge its batteries.The German submarines to be constructed at MDL under `Project-75India (P-75I), in partnership with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), will have AIP, land-attack cruise missiles and other new-generation technologies.The decision to take forward the final techno-commercial negotiations for the six German submarines -- with the option for another three of them at a later stage -- was taken after extensive deliberations among the defence ministry, Navy, the National Security Council Secretariat and others, the sources said.Consequently, the official contract talks for MDL to build the six German submarines began last month. “These new-generation boats under P-75I will come with design ToT (transfer of technology) and a greater indigenisation level of around 60%. The project will serve as a bridge to the future P-76, under which conventional submarines will be constructed based on totally indigenous design,” another source said.Considering France’s expansive strategic partnership with India, there is however still the possibility that the case for three more Scorpenes could be revived if there is top-level intervention.Sources, on their part, say France should be pleased that it is on course to bag several other major projects. For one, the govt-to-govt deal for additional Rafales under the IAF’s around Rs 2 lakh crore project for 114 multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA), in which the bulk of the jets will be manufactured in India, is now in the works, as was reported by TOI.For another, the collaboration to co-develop a new powerful jet engine with French major Saran – at a cost of Rs 61,000 crore -- for India’s fifth-generation stealth fighter called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) has also been virtually finalized.Amid all this, the Navy is keeping its fingers crossed. Apart from the six Scorpenes, the Navy is left with just six old Russian Kilo-class and four German HDW submarines in its conventional underwater fleet. It also has two nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles.China, incidentally, has over 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines.

Poll Do you support the government’s Rs 6.4 trillion transmission plan for hydroelectric capacity in the Brahmaputra basin? Yes, it’s a positive step for sustainable energy No, I have concerns about environmental impact

China begins construction of dam on Brahmaputra



NEW DELHI: The Union government has prepared a Rs 6.4 trillion ($77 billion) transmission plan to transfer more than 76 gigawatts of hydroelectric capacity from the Brahmaputra basin by 2047 to meet rising electricity demand, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) said on Monday.In a report released on Monday, the CEA said the plan includes 208 large hydro projects across 12 sub-basins in the northeastern states, with 64.9 GW of potential capacity and an additional 11.1 GW from pumped-storage plants. ""In view of the substantial hydroelectric potential identified within the Brahmaputra basin, it was felt to have a comprehensive transmission system plan for evacuation of power from this assessed potential. Consequently, a transmission system master plan has been formulated for the evacuation of 65 GW of hydroelectric generation capacity from 12 sub-basins of the Brahmaputra basin,"" the CEA said in the report.The Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and flows through India and Bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its Indian stretch, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh near the China border.The basin’s transboundary nature and proximity to China make water management and infrastructure planning a strategic issue, amid the government's concerns that a Chinese dam on the Yarlung Zangbo (the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra river) could reduce dry-season flows on the Indian side by up to 85 per cent.The Brahmaputra basin covers parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Sikkim, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, and West Bengal, and holds more than 80 per cent of India’s untapped hydro potential, the report said. Arunachal Pradesh alone accounts for 52.2 GW, news agency Reuters reported.Phase one of the plan, running until 2035, will require Rs 1.91 trillion, while phase two will cost 4.52 trillion rupees, according to the CEA, as cited by the Reuters.India aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by achieving 500 GW of non-fossil power generation capacity by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2070.China began building a major dam on the Brahmaputra in southeastern Tibet in July, near the border with India. Premier Li Qiang attended the groundbreaking ceremony.India had raised concerns about the project earlier this year. In January, the ministry of external affairs said, ""China has been urged to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.""","The brahmaputra river, which rises in tibet and flows through india and bangladesh, has significant hydro potential in its indian stretch.

Pak fumes as Taliban back India’s sovereignty over J&K; Muttaqi says Af has options if Pak doesn’t back peace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-fumes-as-taliban-back-indias-sovereignty-over-jk/articleshow/124511439.cms,"Pakistan fumes as Taliban back India’s sovereignty over J&K

NEW DELHI: The Taliban have backed India’s sovereignty over Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) drawing a blistering response from Pakistan over the issue amidst its already tense relationship with Afghanistan that was exacerbated further by heavy border clashes in the past few days. Amidst an outrage in Pakistan, Taliban officials pointed to the fact that India and Taliban backed each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the joint statement issued after external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meeting with Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.Pakistan sees Afghanistan as opening a new front in the strained relationship by endorsing a mention of J&K in the joint statement as located in India. Pakistan has lodged a formal protest with Afghanistan saying the mention violates UNSC resolutions and legal status of J&K but New Delhi sees the joint statement as underscoring its position that India and Afghanistan are contiguous neighbours because the PoK shares a 106-km long border with Afghanistan.Jaishankar, in fact, reiterated in his remarks in the meeting that as a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in Afghanistan’s development and progress.Islamabad summoned the Afghanistan ambassador to say that the joint statement was highly insensitive. President Asif Ali Zardari accused the Taliban of turning away from the Kashmiri people and doing injustice to ""history as well as Muslim Ummah"".Meanwhile, as the Afghanistan-Pakistan clashes intensified, Muttaqi in a press conference in the Afghan embassy accused “certain elements” in Pakistan of fomenting trouble with Afghanistan and said if Pakistan doesn’t want peace, Afghanistan has other options as well.Denying that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has any presence left in Afghanistan, Muttaqi said the people of Pakistan, a vast majority, are peace-loving and want good relations with Afghanistan. Dozens have been killed in the clashes that erupted while Muttaqi was on Indian soil but the minister said the situation, after Taliban’s retaliation, was now under control.“Afghanistan will safeguard its borders and its national interest, and that is why it immediately retaliated to the escalation from Pakistan. We achieved our military objectives last night, and our friends, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have expressed that this conflict should come to an end, so we have paused it from our side for the time being,” said Muttaqi.“The situation is now under control. We only want good relations and peace. Afghanistan is finally free and is working for peace...Pakistan doesn't want good relations and peace, then Afghanistan has other options as well,” added the minister.On Pakistan’s claims that the TTP is being sheltered by the Taliban, Muttaqi said the border was 2400-km long and neither “chengez (Genghis Khan)” nor “angrez (Englishmen)” were able to control it. “Strength alone cannot control it. If Pakistan wants peace, they have a bigger army and better intelligence - why are they not controlling it? This fight is inside Pakistan. Instead of blaming us, they should control the problems on their soil,” said the minister.",Pakistan fumes as taliban back india’s sovereignty over j&k.

Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.","Afghanistan foreign minister visits darul uloom deoband in up.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday once again reiterated his claim that he has played a key role in resolving several long-standing conflicts worldwide, including the dispute between India and Pakistan, as he flew to the Middle East.Trump also referred to the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, alluding that he would resolve the issue as he is good at “solving war.” He went on to claim that the Gaza ceasefire will be the eighth conflict which he has ended.“This will be my eighth war that I have solved, and I hear there is a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one. Because I am good at solving wars,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.“Think about India, Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31, one going for 32, one going for 37 years, with millions of people being killed in every country, and I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good…,” he added.Trump also spoke about the Nobel Peace prize, stating, “It’s an honour to do it. I saved millions of lives. In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024.This was picked for 2024. But there are those who say you could make an exception because a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and complete and great. But I did not do this for the Nobel. I did this for saving lives.”He further claimed that he resolved some conflicts using economic measures, including trade and tariffs.“I settled a few of the wars just based on tariffs. For example, between India and Pakistan, I said, if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I am going to put big tariffs on you both, like 100 per cent, 150 per cent, and 200 per cent. I said I am putting tariffs. I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs, you could have never settled that war,” Trump added.However, New Delhi has consistently rejected the notion that the United States intervened in Operation Sindoor or the resulting ceasefire with Pakistan.Since the ceasefire was announced following Operation Sindoor in May 2025, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he was instrumental in halting the India‑Pakistan conflict - often attributing this to his use of trade and tariffs as leverage.India maintains that the decision to pause hostilities was reached via direct talks between the two sides’ military leadership, without third-party mediation.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has categorically stated in Parliament that no country asked India to halt its counter‑terror operation. The ministry of external affairs has affirmed that trade or tariff negotiations with the US had nothing to do with Operation Sindoor.The conflict was triggered after a dastardly terror attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists. Backed by groups believed to be from across the border. In response, on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor, striking multiple terrorist camps in Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan.A ceasefire was announced on May 10, after direct dialogue between the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) of both countries, on request of Pakistani DGMO.The remarks come as Trump embarks on a Middle East trip, to mark the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.

Shehbaz described Trump as “the man the world needed most at this point in time” and said the world would remember him as someone who “stopped seven, now eight, wars.”He added, “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.

‘Time To Take…’: Trump’s ‘GAZA CHAT’ On Tel Aviv Airport With Ivanka Leaves Netanyahu Staring In Shock

Was Mr. FAFO part of Hamas?







A well-known Palestinian protester and influencer, popularly known online as “Mr FAFO,” was reportedly killed on Sunday amid violent clashes between Hamas and rival Palestinian factions in Gaza.The 27-year-old Saleh al-Jafarawi became known as “Mr FAFO” — short for “F** Around and Find Out”* — in Israeli media because he allegedly celebrated the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed over 1,200 civilians and saw many taken hostage. Later in the war, he was also filmed crying in reaction to Israel’s airstrikes.Mixed reactions poured in following Jafarawi’s death. Many Israelis cheered the news, calling him a Hamas propagandist who fuelled anti-Israel sentiment. On the other hand, pro-Palestinian activists mourned his loss, remembering him as a passionate voice who documented the struggle in Gaza.Footage circulating online reportedly showed his body, with reports suggesting he was killed while covering the incident.After celebrating the October 7 invasion, “Mr FAFO” made more videos in which he pretended to be a doctor, a wounded patient, a fighter, and a journalist.These videos went viral but drew widespread ridicule, especially from pro-Israel viewers, who saw them as fake, staged, and ""lazy propaganda"" rather than serious reporting.During the conflict, he faced accusations on social media of pocketing millions of dollars raised as donations for Gaza residents, including money reportedly intended to build a children’s hospital, reports Times of Israel.“Controversial Gaza activist, derogatorily called ‘Mr FAFO’ due to his performative antics and well known for his support of Hamas and raising an estimated $10 million to build a children’s hospital, only to pocket the money, Saleh Al-Jafarawi, was killed today by unknown assailants,” said Palestinian-American anti-Hamas activist Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib.Alkhatib added that Jafarawi was allegedly accompanying Hamas’s “Saham” unit during clashes with the Doghmosh clan in Gaza City, possibly acting as a cameraman. Hamas-affiliated channels have announced his death, possibly to incite violence against the clan. Alkhatib suggested three possible culprits: Hamas to seize his digital wallet and stir civil war; the Doghmosh clan in retaliation for Hamas raids; or anti-Hamas fighters targeting a terror propagandist. He added that Jafarawi’s body reportedly showed signs of torture.“For the last two years, I have followed Hamas content creator Saleh Al-Jafrawi (‘Mr FAFO’) with a mix of horror and admiration. I was engrossed. Mr FAFO had phenomenal energy, charisma, and creativity. Always popping up in a different costume, once a patient then a radiologist, a jihadist then a foreign correspondent, a ham actor but always with panache and chutzpah, constantly finding inventive ways to grab new audiences and tell his story,” said former Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy.","27-year-old saleh al-jafarawi became known as ‘mr fafo’ in israeli media.
