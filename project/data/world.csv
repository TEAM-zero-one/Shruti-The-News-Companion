HISAR: Amid reports of youths from Fatehabad, Rohtak, Ambala and Sonipat trapped in the Russia-Ukraine war, concern has deepened over the fate of a youth from Hisar district. Sonu, 28, from Madanheri village is feared to have been killed in the conflict, while his companion, Aman, 24, from the same village has been missing since September 22.Both men went to Russia in May 2024 to pursue a foreign language course. Their families said their visas were nearing expiry and they were expected to return soon. What came instead was a claim that Sonu had died. Aman's brother Sunil said on September 3 Aman called home and said he and Sonu were being deceived into joining the Russian army and being sent to fight in Ukraine. ""He told us he didn't want to join the army and begged us to save him,"" Sunil said.On Sept 19, Sonu's uncle Billu received a message on Telegram app, purportedly from a Russian official, which, after translation, stated that Sonu had been missing since Sept 6 and that his body had been found. The family was asked to come to Moscow to claim the body.Russian govt doesn't bear the expense of transporting the body and will at best take it to a Russian airport, the message said. The family has to pay for the flight to India, and if they couldn't afford it, Sonu would be buried in ""Leningrad's Oblast"", it said.Sunil said that on Sept 22, Aman made a video call and told him he was recruited into the Russian army under the pretext of a security job, and that money from his bank account was withdrawn. Since then, the family has lost contact with him as well. The families have approached MHA the ministry of home affairs seeking help, but have yet to receive a satisfactory response.On Oct 7, an email from Tadu Mamu, counsellor at the Indian embassy in Moscow, arrived on Sonu's uncle Billu's email ID saying the Russian authorities have not yet confirmed Sonu's death and that the embassy would share updates once official information was received.The families have appealed to MHA and Indian embassy in Moscow for assistance.","Sonu, 28, from madanheri village is feared to have been killed in the conflict.

Yes, definitely No, it’s unnecessary

NEW DELHI: India and Australia on Thursday decided to further strengthen their bilateral defence collaboration and military interoperability, inked three key pacts and expressed faith in the “strategic convergence” among the `Quad’ countries, amid the Trump administration signalling that the US may no longer be as invested in its Indo-Pacific strategy to counter China as before.The three agreements signed during the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Australian counterpart Richard Marles in Canberra were on sharing of classified information, mutual submarine search and rescue cooperation, and establishment of joint staff talks.Moreover, the two countries are also seeking to conclude a joint maritime security collaboration roadmap as well as ink a new long-term defence and security cooperation framework to succeed the joint declaration signed in 2009, officials said.Amid the raging tariff tensions and plummeting bilateral ties with the US, India is steadily stepping-up bilateral defence cooperation with other `Quad’ countries like Australia and Japan as well as regional players like South Korea and the Philippines, all of whom are deeply concerned over China’s expansionist muscle-flexing in the Indo-Pacific.Singh’s visit to Australia, the first by an Indian defence minister since the NDA govt came to office in 2014, comes soon after India inked a joint declaration on security cooperation with Japan during PM Modi’s visit to Tokyo on Aug 29.Marles, who had earlier stated that China was “the biggest security anxiety” for both India and Australia, and Singh on Thursday underscored the importance of enhancing cooperation with regional partners to help maintain a free, open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They expressed their strong support for freedom of navigation, overflight and unimpeded trade in the region.Noting the “ongoing progress” in defence cooperation among India, Australia, US and Japan, the two ministers also expressed their commitment to enhancing collaboration on maritime domain awareness ahead of the quadrilateral Malabar naval exercise next month and full support for initiatives that advance closer maritime surveillance cooperation among the Quad countries.“We reviewed the full spectrum of India-Australia cooperation, including defence industry, cyber defence, maritime security and regional challenges. We reaffirmed the importance of our comprehensive strategic partnership,” said Singh, who also met Australian PM Anthony Albanese.“We discussed potential for deeper defence industry partnerships. I thank Australia for its steadfast support on cross-border terrorism and shared regional stability. Together, we will deepen cooperation for a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific,” he added.With Pakistan on his radar screen, Singh reiterated India’s stand that “terror and talks cannot go together, terror and trade cannot go together, and water and blood cannot flow together”, urging the international community to come together against all forms of terrorism.Apart from the mutual military logistics support agreement inked in 2020, India and Australia have now also operationalised an air-to-air refuelling pact. Singh was given a live demonstration in this arena on board a KC-30A multi-role transport and tanker aircraft, which refuelled an F-35 fighter enroute to Canberra.","India and australia inked three key pacts and expressed faith in the “strategic convergence’ among the `quad’ countries.

Poll Should India consider granting formal recognition to the Taliban government? Yes, it can boost bilateral ties No, caution is necessary

The Taliban are seeking an upgrade of their relationship with India in the form of diplomatic recognition, as the Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi meets external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Friday. Muttaqi arrived in Delhi Thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost India’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with Kabul, even without a formal recognition for the regime in Kabul.On the eve of Muttaqi’s meeting with Jaishankar here, a top Taliban leader told TOI it’s time for both governments to elevate the relationship by granting recognition to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by the Taliban for the country.“It is the first high level visit by our foreign minister to India and is very significant. We expect it will initiate a new phase of relations between the two countries. There are a lot of areas which can be explored for mutual cooperation during this visit,” said the head of Taliban’s political office and Afghanistan’s ambassador to Qatar Suhail Shaheen.“I think it is time for leadership of both countries to raise the diplomatic level by granting recognition to IEA government and thus paving the way for bilateral cooperation and expansion of relations in various fields,” added Shaheen.The UN Security Council earlier waived a travel ban on Muttaqi to allow him to travel to India. That India was keen to host Muttaqi is a sign of growing trust in the relationship as the Taliban urge India to expand its economic footprint in the country. The visit also helps India further capitalise on the dramatic deterioration in the Taliban’s ties with Pakistan, which accuses Kabul of funding and arming the Pakistan Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Recognition for the Taliban, however, remains a tricky issue for India as the Indian government wants its position to be in consonance with that of the international community. That position is unlikely to change with Muttaqi’s visit. As multiple sources here told TOI, the visit is only indicative of an enhancement in bilateral relations and diplomatic engagements.As the government has said in the past, India seeks a sovereign, democratic and peaceful Afghanistan, where the interests of all sections of Afghan society including women, children and minorities are protected. Additionally, despite credible assurances by Kabul that it won’t allow Afghanistan to be used against India, the Indian government still has concerns about links between Pakistan-based terror groups and forces in Afghanistan. While several countries have accepted Taliban-appointed officials as diplomats, Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul.This lack of recognition is unlikely to come in the way of India’s efforts to ramp up its ties with the Taliban as it maintains its ties are guided by historical relations and friendship with the people of Afghanistan. While India already has projects across the 34 provinces of the country, it has also committed to engaging in more development projects soon, while continuing with its ongoing humanitarian assistance programme, buoyed by the support it has received from the Taliban.Apart from Delhi, Muttaqi is also likely to travel to Agra and Deoband. He was earlier also planning to travel to Mumbai and Hyderabad but that has now been cancelled.",Amir khan muttaqi arrived in delhi thursday for a 6-day visit that is expected to boost india’s fast growing economic ties and people-to-people contacts with kabul.
