NEW DELHI: National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reached Moscow on Tuesday to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation between India and Russia, Russian news agency TASS reported.His visit comes as the Trump-led US administration continues to issue trade threats to countries closely aligned with Russia, including India.This is a scheduled visit with discussions focused on defence cooperation between the two nations. ""The current escalation of the geopolitical situation will also be discussed. Apart from that the topics will include such pressing matters as supplies of Russian oil [to India],"" the source told TASS.Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on India as a “penalty.” He also said India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” prompting India to reiterate that it remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy.Trump further stated that India has ""always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia,"" and is ""Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China.""On Monday, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) described criticism from the US and EU over India’s imports of Russian oil as “unjustified,” pointing out that Western countries had previously supported such trade to stabilise global energy markets and still continue purchasing goods and services from Russia.“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the MEA said, noting that the US and EU have continued trade with Russia, including in energy and key commodities, despite publicly opposing the Ukraine conflict.The MEA also pointed to “double standards,” highlighting that EU trade with Russia in 2024 was significantly higher than India’s.","National security advisor ajit doval reaches moscow to hold talks on strategic partnership, defence, and security cooperation.

India mulls new pilot training system as air traffic booms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-mulls-new-pilot-training-system-as-air-traffic-booms/articleshow/123128116.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system, where a student has to first earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) and then do type rating separately for a specific aircraft, to a unified ""multi-crew pilot licence"" (MPL) system.Directorate General of Civil Aviation will hold a meeting with stakeholders on the issue on Wednesday. If approved, both systems will co-exist, and operators will have the flexibility to choose what best meets their requirements of safety and operational efficiency.This is the second big change India is contemplating in this field, after proposing to make students who from Class 12 arts and commerce streams eligible to pursue CPL - a field reserved for science students with physics and maths in 12th since mid-1990s. As the fastest growing aviation market globally, govt is clearly keen to take steps to meet Indian carriers' requirement for pilots in coming years.At the moment, cadet pilots have to first do CPL that involves, among other things, flying training aircraft for 200 hours. They then need to do simulator-based type rating for specific aircraft like Airbus A320 or Boeing 737.MPL will require them to fly a small training plane for about 70 hours.Then they will do simulator training for 140 to 160 hours. Subsequently, airlines will induct them as trainees on that type of aircraft. Approved by International Civil Aviation Organisation, MPL has been adopted by over 50 airlines globally, like Lufthansa, Etihad, flyDubai and Singapore Airlines.""We will evaluate both the systems and take a considered view on what is best in terms of ensuring high training standards and meeting airline requirements. MPL was considered by us in the past too. There has again been a request to consider the same and that is being done,"" said senior govt officials. If approved, MPL will be introduced gradually over 2-3 years and CPL will continue to exist for non-airline students.An integrated programme, MPL ""lays emphasis on developing key competencies that are essential to safely operate modern commercial aircraft. It can be tailored to specific aircraft type and the operational philosophy of airlines which will ensure a steady stream of pilots"", said a senior pilot.""MPL should have been adopted several years ago to meet India's growing aviation needs... MPL aligns better with modern airline operational realities than the current CPL system which is outdated for a fast-developing aviation sector. India needs 2,000-plus new pilots annually over the next decade,"" said another captain.Opposing MPL, a senior captain said: ""Our regulatory system lacks necessary robustness to adequately oversee and enforce MPL program standards consistently.""","India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system.

Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to increase tariffs on Russian oil imports from India, warning that such a move could damage ties with a key American ally while giving China leniency.In a post on X on Tuesday, Haley took aim at what she sees as an uneven approach from the Trump administration. “India should not be buying oil from Russia. But China, an adversary and the number one buyer of Russian and Iranian oil, got a 90-day tariff pause,” she wrote.“Don’t give China a pass and burn a relationship with a strong ally like India,"" she added.Her remarks came after Trump, in a press briefing Tuesday, threatened to “very substantially” increase tariffs on Indian goods, following the 25% duty imposed just last week. He also rejected India’s reported offer of zero tariffs on American goods, saying, “That’s not good enough, because of what they’re doing with oil.”The White House has pointed to the growing US trade deficit with India as justification for the move, accusing New Delhi of maintaining high tariffs on American goods and limiting market access. India’s continued imports of Russian crude and military hardware have also drawn scrutiny.India is now the largest seaborne buyer of Russian crude oil, importing nearly 1.75 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, up 1% from the same period last year.While US initially welcomed India's role in helping stabilise global oil supplies, Trump now claims those purchases are helping finance President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.India, however, has remained firm in its stance. India’s ministry of commerce and industry responded to Trump’s announcement by reaffirming that national interest remains the country’s top priority.“The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” the ministry said in a statement.New Delhi has also made it clear that its agriculture and dairy sectors remain off the table in any trade negotiations — a position it has consistently maintained in all prior trade agreements.","Indian-american republican leader and former us ambassador to the united nations nikki haley took aim at what she sees as an uneven approach from the trump administration.

The US President had earlier signed an executive order on August 1 titled 'Further modifying the reciprocal tariff rates', slapping a 25% duty on Indian goods.While the executive order did not formally mention a “penalty” for Russian oil and military imports, Trump’s rhetoric has escalated over the past week.He previously said India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” prompting India to assert that it remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The MEA also pointed out what it called “double standards,” noting that the EU’s trade with Russia in 2024 was significantly higher than India’s. EU imports of Russian LNG, for instance, hit a record 16.5 million tonnes. The US too, the statement said, continues to import uranium, palladium, and fertilizers from Russia.India’s Russian oil imports rose from just 0.2% of total imports pre-war to over 35% in recent months, making Russia India’s top supplier. The MEA clarified that the shift occurred after traditional suppliers in the Middle East redirected exports to Europe post the Ukraine war.Despite tensions, India said it remains committed to ongoing trade negotiations. The next round of talks with the US is scheduled for August 25–29 in New Delhi. So far, five rounds have been held, but disagreements remain, especially over US demands for market access in agriculture, dairy, and genetically modified food, areas India says affect millions of livelihoods.The US is India’s top trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting $186 billion in 2024–25.

NEW DELHI: Security forces have recovered a cache of arms and explosives including Chinese grenades and an IED manual from a stony cave in the Kalaroos area of Kupwara district following a joint three-day operation, officials said on Monday.The Border Security Force, Indian Army, and Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out the operation between August 2 and 4. According to a statement from BSF Kashmir, “In a 3-day joint search operation in Kalaroos, Kupwara (J&K), BSF, Army and police uncovered a stony cave on 04 Aug 2025. 12 Chinese grenades, Chinese pistol with ammunition, Kenwood radio set, Urdu IED manual and fire sticks recovered from the hideout and foiled the nefarious plan of the terrorist. ”As per intelligence inputs, 'terrorists were directed by their Pakistani handlers to use these to target state police and other security forces in the coming days'.The joint forces said the recovery points to cross-border terror support and efforts to revive militant activity in North Kashmir.In South Kashmir, operations are also underway in the Akhal Devsar area of Kulgam district for the fourth consecutive day.One terrorist has been killed so far in a firefight. On Saturday, security forces engaged in an overnight encounter with militants in the Akhal area. The Indian Army’s Chinar Corps posted on X: “OP AKHAL, Kulgam.

"MoD clears big arms deals, including BrahMos, armed drones, worth Rs 67,000cr",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mod-clears-big-arms-deals-including-brahmos-armed-drones-worth-rs-67000cr/articleshow/123127687.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Tuesday gave the initial nod for the procurement of 87 new heavy-duty armed drones and over 110 more air-launched BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, which IAF used as the primary weapon to strike Pakistani airbases and radar sites in May, among several modernisation proposals collectively worth Rs 67,000 crore.The acceptance of necessity (AoN) granted by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) for the 87 armed medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) remotely-piloted aircraft will see an Indian company tying up with a foreign one to produce the drones with “an indigenous content of 60%”.“The need for such MALE drones, armed with air-to-ground missiles and laser-guided bombs as well as capable of operating at long ranges, was acutely felt for the three Services during Operation Sindoor,” a senior official told TOI.“The 87 drones, with ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and weapon-carrying capability, will cost around Rs 20,000 crore. Another Rs 11,000 crore will be for logistical and other support by the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) for 10 years,” he added.India, of course, had used Israeli-origin Harop and Harpy kamikaze drones, which act as cruise missiles by exploding into enemy assets and radars, to hit targets deep inside Pakistan during the May 7-10 hostilities.The armed forces hope to induct the 87 new MALE drones, which return to their bases after strike missions, faster than the 31-armed MQ-9B `Predator’ HALE (high-altitude, long endurance) drones ordered from the US for Rs 32,350 crore in Oct last year, which will be delivered only in the 2029-30 timeframe.The over 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles, which are jointly manufactured by India and Russia, in turn, will cost around Rs 10,800 crore. These 450-km range missiles, which fly almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, combined with Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, with a combat radius of about 1,500-km, constitute a deadly weapons package, as was witnessed during Operation Sindoor.The DAC also accorded AoN for eight BrahMos fire control systems and vertical launchers for older Indian warships for Rs 650 crore. Around 20 frontline warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the BrahMos missiles.In March last year, the defence ministry had inked a Rs 19,519 crore procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for frontline warships with the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace. The total value of deals inked for BrahMos has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the “prime conventional (non-nuclear) precision strike weapons” for the armed forces.For the Army, the DAC gave the nod for new thermal imager-based driver night-sights for infantry combat vehicles (BMPs). “This would enhance night driving capability of the BMPs and provide higher mobility and operational advantage to the mechanised infantry,” another official said.The DAC also approved the procurement of compact autonomous surface crafts and upgrade of the older Israeli Barak-1 point defence missile systems on warships. “The autonomous crafts will provide the Navy’s capability for detection, classification and neutralisation of threats in anti-submarine warfare missions,” he added.The IAF, in turn, will get specialised mountain radars to enhance its air surveillance capabilities along and across the northern borders with China. The Saksham (Israeli-origin Spyder) anti-aircraft missile system, which has a 15-km range, will also be upgraded to enhance air defence capabilities.“The DAC also accorded AoN for sustenance of the American C-17 and C-130J aircraft fleets and comprehensive annual maintenance contract of the Russian S-400 long-range air defence missile systems,” the official said.","The acceptance of necessity (aon) for the 87 armed medium-altitude long-endurance (male) remotely-piloted aircraft will see an indian company tying up with a foreign one. The need for such male drones, armed with air-to-ground missiles and laser-guided bombs as well as capable of operating at long ranges, was acutely felt for the three services during operation sindoor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123127691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-902556,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Long-range precision strikes during the cross-border hostilities in May caused ""a huge psychological impact"" in Pakistan, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday, reiterating that Operation Sindoor had not yet been called off.The CDS emphasised the need to adapt swiftly to disruptive technologies, rethink legacy structures and prioritise synergy across the Army, Navy and IAF to tackle the challenges emanating from the constantly evolving nature of warfare. ""War and politics are closely related. Wars are often fought to achieve political purposes. Today, we see very short, precise wars - like in Operation Sindoor - where political goals are achieved through rapid and targeted action,"" the CDS said at the inaugural edition of the Annual Trident Lecture Series organised by the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.Noting that ""domination"" through impact and effect is the new norm, the CDS said Operation Sindoor was not undertaken to capture territory or prisoners of war. ""There were very long-range precision strikes (at selected targets). The impact was important. Physical was less, but the psychological impact was much more. (India) could hit very, very deep inside with precision,"" he said.""It created a huge impact psychologically, displaying sophistication and superiority.This is the matrix of victory today, it has nothing to do with territory.

The award had refuted China's expansive claims on SCS waters in its dispute with Manila. In 2023, India had for the first time explicitly called upon China to abide by the ruling and followed it up with a similar assertion in a joint statement with Quad a year later.Among other key takeaways from the meeting was adoption of terms of reference for negotiations for a preferential trade agreement and signing of an agreement for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. The leaders also adopted a plan of action (2025-2029) for implementation of the strategic partnership. India also announced a gratis e-tourist visa facility for Filipino nationals for a period of one year.Modi also thanked Marcos, who has been looking to ramp up defence and security cooperation with countries like India and Japan amid increasing tensions with China in the SCS, for a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""As maritime nations, maritime cooperation between the two countries is both natural and necessary. Today, when the President is in India, three ships of the Indian Navy are participating in a naval exercise in the Philippines for the first time. India's hydrography ship is also involved in this,"" Modi said, adding that India and Philippines are friends by choice, and partners by destiny.The leaders called for expeditious conclusion of negotiations for the preferential trade agreement (PTA) for promotion of mutual trade and Manila expressed interest in procuring more defence equipment from India, apart from the BrahMos missile defence systems India is already supplying to it. For India, helping Manila build up its defence capabilities is also a way of getting back at Beijing, a major defence supplier to Pakistan.The visit by Marcos, who backed interoperability between the armed forces of the two countries, coincided with India's first joint patrol of the SCS with the Philippines. The PLA accused the Philippines of ""rallying an external country to interfere in the SCS by organising so-called joint patrols which undermine regional peace and stability"". It did not name India.The visit by Marcos also took place ahead of a likely visit to China by Modi later this month for the SCO summit. Talks are also on for a possible visit by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi to India this month.","The two sides signed 13 agreements and mous, which included finalisation of terms of reference for cooperation between all three wings of the armed forces.

Ciara’s ‘Level Up’ advice for single women sparked major backlash

Fans accused Ciara of judgment and hypocrisy

Ciara’s heartfelt response: growth, not judgment

In January 2018, singer Ciara stirred a storm of debate on social media after she shared a sermon clip by Pastor John Gray encouraging women to embrace “wife energy” if they wanted to attract a husband. What seemed like motivational advice quickly escalated into a cultural flashpoint — prompting both fierce criticism and passionate support.In the Instagram post, Ciara captioned a clip from Gray’s sermon with: “#LevelUp. Don’t Settle.” In the video, Gray states:“Too many women want to be married but you’re walking in the spirit of ‘girlfriend.’”He continues, “You’re not a wife when I marry you, you’re a wife when I find you… A wife is not the presence of a ring, it’s the presence of your character.”The post was widely interpreted as Ciara telling single women that their lack of romantic success was due to their failure to ""act like wives.""Ciara’s advice came under fire quickly. Many pointed to her previous relationship with rapper Future — which ended in a very public and painful breakup — and called her tone tone-deaf now that she was happily married to NFL star Russell Wilson One viral tweet criticized her for preaching from a “throne”: “You can be the queen of the ball today and have cake in your face tomorrow!” Another added, “Didn’t you need grace, mercy & compassion when you were being dragged up and down the Internet for the Future situation?”Facing the heat, Ciara responded with a heartfelt Instagram post explaining the context behind her message. “I was one that girl wanting to be loved a certain way but was making the wrong choices… I needed to love myself.” She emphasized that her “level up” mindset came from self-love and personal growth, not judgment.Also Read: “She just wants attention”: Simone Biles faces unexpected NFL backlash as feud with Riley Gaines fuels fan criticism Looking back, this viral moment reflected a deeper cultural tension about dating standards, double standards, and how women support — or criticize — each other in the name of empowerment.",Ciara stirred a storm of debate on social media after she shared a sermon clip by pastor john gray.

In a casual back-and-forth, Sharpe turns to Ocho and says:Yes, he’s probably joking.But that wasn’t even the only legal drama Sharpe’s been juggling. He’s also facing a $20 million defamation lawsuit from Jimalita Tillman, the woman who went viral for dancing with Usher after Sharpe and Ocho implied onthat she was married during the moment.Tillman says the comments were false and damaging, and she wants payback.So yeah... that “$5,900” jab?
