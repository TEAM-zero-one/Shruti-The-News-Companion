"Assam's land a magnet for illegals, says report 'suppressed' for 41 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assams-land-a-magnet-for-illegals-says-report-suppressed-for-41-years-junks-narrative-that-83-nellie-killings-were-communal/articleshow/125682292.cms,"The report had made recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, defining ‘Assamese’ identity and safeguarding it

GUWAHATI: Successive govts in Assam allowed the state's ""land and identity crisis"" to fester for four decades while they kept under wraps a report that had flagged it as a ticking time bomb that led to the 1983 Nellie massacre, among other disturbances.The Tribhuvan Prasad Tewary Commission, tasked by the then Congress govt to investigate the Jan-April 1983 cycle of violence accompanying the anti-foreigner movement of the time, made multiple recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, evicting infiltrators, defining ""Assamese"" identity, and safeguarding it.The first AGP ministry tabled the report in the assembly in 1987, but its contents were never revealed, much less discussed for implementation. The BJP-led govt made the report public this week, 41 years after it was signed, sealed and delivered.Contrary to decades of narratives framing the disturbances of 1983 as communal, the Tewary report notes that any such interpretation would be ""a very superficial view"". It also points out that ""all sections of society suffered as a result of the senseless violence"" and that the victims ""were not confined to one religious, ethnic or linguistic group"".""Many perceptive witnesses have gone into this historical aspect and interpreted the disturbances as clashes of economic interests. In many cases, they arose out of land disputes,"" the former judge writes, describing illegal occupation of land by immigrants as ""one of the greatest irritants"" for the Assamese people.""Land has been the main attraction for illegal immigrants,"" the report says, seeking to drive home the point that fears of the indigenous population being overrun were ""not imaginary"".The report cites census figures and testimonies of responsible witnesses, including erstwhile British administrators and census commissioners ""who did not suffer either from pride or prejudice, nor had any personal or group interest in the matter"".Tewary notes in the 1984 report that ""ejectment of encroachment stopped in 1979"". He mentions that infiltrator detection and encroacher removal are ""inseparably linked"", suggesting that both must be carried out by a multi-disciplinary task force led by magistrates and backed by armed police rather than leaving the task to junior officials.The report warns that immovable property should not be transferred into the hands of non-Assamese, recommending ""reasonable restrictions"" even on Indian citizens from outside the state. ""While defining who is an Assamese for this purpose, a reference to the National Register of Citizens or a minimum period of domicile in Assam or/and such other conditions, as might be found reasonable, may be examined.""On immigrants, the report distinguishes between two categories - refugees fleeing persecution in erstwhile East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and those who migrated primarily in search of land and economic opportunities.""Those who have been victims of persecution deserve all sympathy and support which has been the consistent national policy. Some of them have already been admitted as Indian citizens and granted citizenship certificates. The remaining should be deemed to be the citizens of India,"" the report says.This distinction between migrants from Bangladesh is similar to what was outlined later in CAA.","Tribhuvan prasad tewary commission made recommendations on curbing illegal immigration, regulating land transfer, defining ‘assamese’ identity and safeguarding it.

Social media response:

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Sounds like another grift as you kill tourism -- great f****g work!





Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","Starting january 1, 2026, us residents will pay $80 for an annual pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.

India’s Maritime Future Is Preordained: CDS Chauhan Predicts Indian Navy’s Decisive Warfighting Role

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Sunday said he would not call Bangladesh “anything other than a friend” and expressed confidence that “things would turn around” for India’s eastern neighbour after its parliamentary elections in February 2026.India–Bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, 2024. Hasina, who resigned after months of student-led protests, has been living in Delhi since her ouster.“I would still refrain from calling Bangladesh anything other than a friend — because this could be a temporary and transitory moment. We’ll have to wait; elections have to happen, and then something else can happen,” Admiral Tripathi said in Pune, where he attended the passing-out parade of cadets at the National Defence Academy (NDA).He added that he met Bangladeshi cadets — the NDA also trains cadets from friendly foreign countries — ahead of the parade, and recalled that his first visit after taking over as Navy chief was to Bangladesh.“I was supposed to go to some ‘fancy’ capital but I said, ‘No. I must first go to Bangladesh.’ Tremendous warmth, tremendous hospitality...tremendous nostalgia about what India did,” he remarked, referring possibly to the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the creation of Bangladesh.“I'm an eternal optimist and I hope that things would turn around as far as Bangladesh is concerned,” Admiral Tripathi remarked.The neighbouring nation is currently governed by a caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which assumed charge days after Hasina’s exit.Hasina was recently sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity” linked to the student protest movement. Dhaka has repeatedly sought her extradition, while New Delhi maintains that the request remains under “consideration.”","India–bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the sheikh hasina-led government on august 5, 2024.

What is the controversy about?





Who agrees, who doesn't



Who is Maulana Mahmood Madani?



NEW DELHI: Maulana Mahmood Madani has sparked fresh controversy with his remarks on the Supreme Court ’s handling of the Babri Masjid and triple talaq cases, as well as his comments on ‘ jihad ’ and ‘ghar wapsi’.His statements have sharply divided the political landscape, drawing criticism from the BJP and even differing views from within the Muslim community, including the All India Muslim Jamaat.Madani, on Saturday, alleged that the apex court of the country was functioning under pressure from the BJP-led central government. He cited verdicts like Babri Masjid and triple talaq.""After the verdict into Babri Masjid, triple talaq and several other matters, it seems that courts are functioning under Government's pressure for a few years now...We have several instances before that have raised questions on the character of courts...Supreme Court is eligible to be called supreme only when it follows the Constitution and when it upholds the law. If it doesn't do that, it doesn't deserve to be called 'Supreme',"" he said.Moreover, he criticised the vilification of the term ""jihad"", citing the increased use of terms like ""love jihad, land jihad, 'Taleem' jihad, 'thook' jihad"". He said that the term was used in the Islamic Holy book of Quran ""in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence.""""Enemies of Islam and Muslims have made 'jihad' a synonym of abuse, conflict and violence. Terms like Love jihad, Land jihad, 'Taleem' Jihad, 'Thook' Jihad are used to insult the faith of Muslims. It is unfortunate that responsible people in goverment and media feel no shame in using such terms...In Islam, 'jihad' has been used in the Quran in several respects. It has been used in the sense of one's duties, and the welfare of society and humanity. When it has been used for war, it has been used in the sense of finishing off oppression and violence. Isliye jab jab zulm hoga tab tab jihad hoga,"" he said.He further took on the conversion law, saying that it was against the fundamental right to freedom of religion. Contrasting the same with ""ghar wapsi"", a term widely used to refer to a program of religious conversion to Hinduism, he said that those ""converting people into a particular religion have a free hand.""""Constitution of the country has provided us with Right to Freedom of Religion. But through the Conversion Law, this fundamental right is being finished off. This law is being used in a manner in which practising a religion becomes liable to fear and punishment. On the other hand, in the name of 'Ghar Wapasi', those converting people into a particular religion have a free hand. They are not questioned, and no legal action is taken against them,"" he said.All India Muslim Jamaat chief, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, advised Madani to steer away from making comments on Supreme Court, Parliament and government as ""crores of Muslims trust"" these institutions.""Not just me, but crores of Muslims in India do not agree with his statement. Maulana Mahmood Madani is a religious man. He should speak from a religious point of view. He should not provoke or instigate Muslims. Crores of Muslims trust the Supreme Court, Parliament and Government,"" ANI quoted him saying.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari criticised his statements saying: ""If there is any place in the world where our brothers and sisters of the Muslim community are safest and facilitated, it is India.""Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) national spokesperson Vinod Bansal also condemned the statement saying: ""If a leader like Maulana Madani, who is considered ideal by the Muslim community, calls all Muslims 'jihadi', calls all Muslims a community which is a victim of atrocities and calls upon all Muslims to do 'jihad', who calls all non-Muslims 'murda' - I would like to ask him (Madani) if all freedom fighters and army jawans are 'murda kaum'. He has questioned the Supreme Court, too. He has said that the Supreme Court should be supreme and should also do supreme work. Will he give them a certificate for the same? This is the height of 'jihad'.""Bihar governor Arif Mohammad Khan, however, agreed with the 'jihad' statement saying: ""As long as oppression exists, jihad will exist. It is very difficult for me to disagree with that. Oppression or injustice—according to the Quranic idea—does not mean only the oppression you face. If any weak or poor person is being oppressed, it becomes your responsibility to raise your voice for them and help them. If there is oppression, then it is necessary to speak out against it, and that is what is called jihad. .. Madani's public statement about 'jihad' contradicts what is in texts followed in an institution he's associated with.""Maulana Mahmood Madani is the current National President of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH), one of the country's oldest Muslim organisations.Born in 1964, he is the grandson of Maulana Syed Hussain Ahmad Madani, a leading theologian and an important figure in India’s freedom movement. His father, Maulana As’ad Madani, was a significant force in the JUH and served in the Rajya Sabha for nearly 17 years.After completing his studies in Islamic theology at Darul Uloom Deoband in 1992, Mahmood Madani began working with the JUH, eventually becoming its General Secretary in 2001 and later a Rajya Sabha MP from 2006 to 2012.He has organised anti-terrorism conferences, facilitated interfaith dialogue through numerous “Sadhbhavana Sansad” events, and overseen educational reforms within madrasas.

NEW DELHI: India has affirmed its solidarity with Sri Lanka during the crisis created amid Cyclone Ditwah as it continued efforts to save lives and deliver urgent relief. Under Operation Sagar Bandhu, Chetak helicopters deployed from INS Vikrant carried out search and rescue sorties across Sri Lanka during the weekend, assisting the affected.A video released by the High Commission of India in Colombo shows the rescue operations from onboard the aircraft, with personnel lowering ropes, harnesses and inflatable rafts to reach people stranded in floodwaters. Survivors are seen swimming towards the rescue lines before being lifted to safety.Another video from the High Commission shows a Chetak helicopter rescuing a family of four stranded on a rooftop on Saturday. The family was safely airlifted and taken to a secure location as part of Operation Sagar Bandhu.Additionally, the Indian Air Force’s C-130J transport aircraft landed in Colombo at 10 am with relief supplies as India increased its humanitarian response to Cyclone Ditwah. The aircraft is also expected to evacuate stranded Indian citizens as operations continue.On Sunday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar noted the close coordination between NDRF teams and Sri Lankan authorities as relief efforts continue across the island nation.So far, India has airlifted 27 tonnes of relief material to Colombo. This includes 21 tonnes flown in by a C-130 military transport aircraft and an Ilyushin IL-76 from Hindan Air Base on Friday night, which also carried more than 80 NDRF personnel and 8 tonnes of equipment, as cited by ANI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also conveyed his condolences to the people of Sri Lanka who have lost loved ones in the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah. He also expressed hope for the safety, comfort and quick recovery of all affected families.India has also said it is prepared to provide further assistance as the situation develops.

Appealing to people across the country, he urged them to experience the beauty of the Himalayan valleys during the winter season, according to an official release.Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this mention, saying that the Prime Minister is the biggest brand ambassador of Uttarakhand tourism.In the 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, Prime Minister Modi dedicated nearly two and a half minutes specifically to Uttarakhand.He said that winter tourism in the state is attracting a large number of visitors. Places such as Auli, Munsiyari, Dayara, and Chopta are gaining popularity during the winter months.The Prime Minister mentioned that just a few weeks ago, Uttarakhand hosted its first high-altitude ultra-run marathon at an elevation of 14,500 feet near Adi Kailash in Pithoragarh.

Opposition flags Delhi blast, SIR, air pollution and farmers’ concerns

Government ready to hear Opposition, stresses rules and procedure

Bills listed for the Winter Session

NEW DELHI: An all-party meeting was held on Sunday ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament . The Opposition demanded detailed discussions during the session and raised concerns over the government’s handling of key national matters.The Opposition sought debates on national security in the wake of the recent Delhi blast, the “SIR” issue, rising air pollution, farmers’ concerns, safeguarding democracy and foreign policy developments.The meeting was chaired by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju . Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arjun Ram Meghwal and JP Nadda were also present.On the Opposition side, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh, TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav and AIADMK’s M Thambi Durai were among those attending.Kalyan Banerjee criticized the government for not allowing certain issues raised by the Opposition to be discussed. He highlighted key concerns such as SIR and MGNREGA and questioned the role of the Opposition if parliamentary debate is restricted.Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said the party raised these issues at the meeting and insisted that Parliament must debate them.“It seems the government, under the leadership of the prime minister and the home minister, is looking to finish off India’s democracy and parliamentary traditions,” he said.Gogoi added that the Opposition wanted a discussion on national security, especially after the Delhi blast, and on “ensuring the purity of the voter list”. He also flagged economic security, saying farmers were still not receiving fair prices.On foreign policy, Gogoi said, “India is formulating its foreign policy on the basis of other countries. Someone does not like us buying oil from Russia. Another country is investing in its defence and we are not ready.”Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav warned that his party would not allow the House to function if a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is not held.“We will not allow the House to function if discussion is not held on SIR. The Samajwadi Party has raised the issue of SIR because on a large scale, I have seen irregularities. First, we used to hear but now we are seeing that people's votes are being cut. In Bihar, there have been malpractices. We have demanded a discussion on it (SIR). They cannot shy away from it by citing the Election Commission,” he said.On the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, Congress MP Pramod Tiwari also highlighted several issues the Opposition intends to raise.He also pointed to the schedule of parliamentary business and strategic meetings planned by the Opposition.“The SIR was conducted across the entire state in a very short span of time, which is impossible... Blasts have occurred in the capital. Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policies are completely lost. In addition, air pollution in Delhi and other states must be discussed in detail. We have a strategic meeting today at 6 pm, and the Business Advisory Committee meeting is happening at 4 pm. Let us see what is on the BJP’s agenda,” Tiwari said.DMK MP Tiruchi Siva said that all Opposition parties were unanimous in demanding discussion on the “SIR” issue during the session.CPI-M MP John Brittas said, “Delhi blast exposed govt; we want discussion on security issues.” He added that if Parliament faces disruptions, “it is full responsibility of government.”After the all-party meeting, Rijiju addressed concerns about the functioning of Parliament and the conduct of members during the Winter Session. He emphasized that the government was open to discussions and intended to ensure that all issues are debated within parliamentary rules.“No one said that the Parliament will not function or will not let it function. Some leaders said that they can create a ruckus in the House over SIR. I am saying this in a positive manner that we are ready to listen to the opposition...Parliament belongs to everyone; it belongs to the country. There is a method to discuss every issue in the Parliament. There are rules, there are conventions,” Rijiju said.The Winter Session will run from December 1 to 19 and include 15 sittings. Parliament is expected to take up major legislative and financial business.The Health Security and National Security Cess Bill, 2025 is likely to be introduced to impose a new cess aimed at improving the country’s health infrastructure and national security preparedness. The President has recommended its introduction under provisions applicable to Money Bills.The Manipur GST (Second Amendment) Bill, 2025 seeks to improve tax administration in the state, while the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 proposes changes to modernise excise regulations on goods and industries.Other important proposals include amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, Corporate Laws, National Highways Act and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, as well as the Higher Education Commission of India Bill, 2025, which aims to streamline higher education regulation.Maritime sector reforms including merchant shipping and port-related bills, are also expected to strengthen compliance with global standards.Parliament will also take up the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2025-26 and the related Appropriation Bill. Private Members’ Bills are scheduled on December 5 and 19, with resolutions on December 12.","All-party meeting was held on sunday ahead of the winter session of parliament.

Hong Kong high-rise fire





Hong Kong political activist Finn Lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128, pushing back against officials who blamed the disaster on bamboo scaffolding that was used in the tall buildings. Lau said that bamboo is fire-resistant and has been used safely for decades, so he believes it could not be the main cause. Instead, he accused authorities of using bamboo as a convenient excuse to avoid answering tougher questions about safety rules, inspections, and emergency planning.In his post, Lau said that government departments were too slow to respond and had ignored earlier warnings about overcrowded construction sites and poor fire-prevention measures. He also criticised officials for shifting responsibility instead of explaining why safety standards were not enforced and why the blaze spread so quickly in a modern city like Hong Kong. According to Lau, the real issue was long-term government negligence, not bamboo materials.He blamed the mesh netting, saying its highly flammable nature had been overlooked, and accused the government of pushing metal scaffolding before completing a proper investigation.He claimed that the government ignored earlier reports and whistleblower complaints about the widespread use of non-compliant, flammable mesh nets on Hong Kong construction sites over the past year.A devastating fire ripped through a high-rise residential block, Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po in Hong Kong, earlier this week, enveloping multiple floors in thick smoke. Firefighters raced to the scene, evacuating hundreds of residents as flames spread rapidly across the building’s exterior. The blaze burned for several hours before crews finally brought it under control. Several people have been treated for smoke inhalation, and emergency services continue to check for other potential casualties. The disaster killed hundreds with many more still missing.Authorities said the fire began on construction scaffolding wrapped in protective netting and foam-like panels during renovation. Fire alarms reportedly failed and many residents had to alert neighbours manually.",Hong kong political activist finn lau posted a long analysis on social media after a massive fire killed 128.
