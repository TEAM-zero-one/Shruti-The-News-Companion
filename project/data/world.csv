Strategic context

NEW DELHI: India on Monday marked its 77th Republic Day with ceremonial events to begin early morning at Kartavya Path, where the national flag will be unfurled by the President and the annual parade will showcase the country’s military strength, cultural diversity and developmental journey.The celebrations will take place along the Kartavya Path stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, carrying the themes ‘Swatantrata ka Mantra: Vande Mataram’ and ‘Samriddhi ka Mantra: Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. This year’s parade also commemorates 150 years of Vande Mataram, the national song.Adding diplomatic significance to the celebrations, president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and president of the European Council Antonio Luís Santos da Costa are attending the Republic Day celebrations as chief guests. The two leaders are on a state visit to India from January 25 to 27 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The parade will also feature a European Union contingent comprising four flag bearers on three gypsies, carrying the flag of the European Union, the EU military staff flag, and the flags of EU naval force Atalanta and EU naval force Aspides.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, was born in 1958 and is a medical doctor by training.She has served in public office for over two decades and held several key ministerial portfolios in Germany between 2005 and 2019, including family and youth, labour and defence.She assumed office as president of the European Commission in 2019 and was re-elected for a second term in July 2024. In her current mandate, she is focused on strengthening Europe’s competitiveness, democratic institutions, and defence and security capabilities.Speaking recently, von der Leyen said, “Europe and India have chosen strategic partnership, dialogue and openness,” adding that the two sides are “building mutual resilience.”At the World Economic Forum in Davos, she said the European Union is close to finalising a free trade agreement with India. “There is still work to do. But we are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement. Some call it the mother of all deals. One that would create a market of 2 billion people, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP,” she said.EU commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic has said that negotiations on the FTA are nearing conclusion. Foreign affairs expert Robinder Sachdev noted that the agreement has been under discussion for over two decades.Antonio Luís Santos da Costa, President of the European Council, was born in Lisbon in 1961 and is a senior Portuguese political leader. He comes from a family with Portuguese, Indian and Mozambican roots and holds a law degree from the University of Lisbon.Costa joined the Portuguese Socialist Party early in his career and went on to serve in several key roles, including minister for parliamentary affairs, minister for justice, member and vice-president of the European parliament, minister of state and minister for the interior, and mayor of Lisbon.He served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 2015 for nine years, during which the country saw stable economic growth, reduced unemployment, sound public finances and increased investment in renewable energy. He assumed office as president of the European Council in December 2024.During the visit, India and the European Union are expected to unveil a security and defence strategic partnership, along with expected discussions on free trade agreement. The agreement is set to be signed by EU high representative and vice-president Kaja Kallas and defence minister Rajnath Singh, making it only the third such comprehensive defence partnership the EU has signed in Asia, after Japan and the Republic of Korea.An EU official described the current phase of ties as a “culmination of remarkable intensifying relations,” noting that both sides now recognise that their security and prosperity are closely linked in a changing global environment.(With inputs from agencies)","The celebrations will take place along the kartavya path stretch from rashtrapati bhavan to the national war memorial.

As we turn 76 as a constitutional Republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the Gita and the Bible of our governance. Most constitutions begin with black letter law; ours begins with art. If the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance, the best metaphor for the Indian Republic is a document that speaks to the soul before it speaks to the statute.India’s Constitution is widely celebrated as a legal masterpiece, a visionary consolidation of checks, balances, rights and responsibilities. But buried in the book is a quieter triumph: 22 handdrawn illustrations, each accompanying one of its first 22 Parts, and rendering a book of law into a living tapestry of our civilisational spirit.Nandalal Bose and his Shantiniketan associates were not decorating after the fact. They were intentionally and symbolically rendering the spirit of each constitutional Part. It is spirit, not text, that is reflected in the design. With each page we turn, we step into an art gallery of Indian being.This is where aesthetics meet authority. There are a handful of countries where the Constitution is also a work of art.Ours is one of them.Crafted in flowing calligraphy by Prem Raizada and illumined by Bose’s team, the Constitution is handwritten, hand-painted and heart-born. Every page radiates an aesthetic that marries legal form with cultural substance. The intricate patterns of the Preamble, the artistic flourish of the Ashokan Emblem, the quiet reverence of Himalayan magnificence: each stroke reminds us that beauty is not superficial, but constitutional.The artists, paid Rs 25 per page, made priceless manuscripts, which are today enshrined in helium-filled chambers in the Parliament Library, more revered than rare manuscripts, more sacred than statute books. As an illustrated ‘Gita of Governance’, the Constitution’s illustrated manuscript does not shout but whispers in ink. Its 22 illustrations serve as metaphors for the Parts they accompany, symbols that communicate through visual language the values, dilemmas and aspirations that laws alone cannot express.For instance, the pairing of Part III on Fundamental Rights with the conquest of Lanka by Lord Rama is no accident. It evokes the triumph of dharma over tyranny. The depiction of the Dandi March alongside Part XVII on official language is not a coincidence; it is a subtle nod to linguistic unity as an act of peaceful assertion. These aren’t annotations; they are visual philosophies.Such symbolic pairings do more than inform; they inspire. They transform the Constitution from a legal text into a national epic, in equal parts scripture, statute and story.The illustrated Constitution is a Republic in technicolor, where India is illustrated on every page: an India that is inclusive, plural, layered, and luminous. From the seals of Mohenjodaro to the Himalayas, from Nalanda’s scholarly calm to Noakhali’s pain, these illustrations span centuries, religions, regions and ideologies.This is not an India of slogans, but of symbols. Buddha and Mahavira stand alongside Netaji and Shivaji. It is a great way of conveying how the Indian philosophy consists of two binary elements — Yuddha (war) and Buddha (peace). Ashoka canvases along with Lakshmibai. Ram and Krishna converse with Guru Gobind Singh. These are not political choices; they are civilisational ones. The message is profound: India is not made by any one moment or man, but by the multitude.Each page tells a story — not just of governance, but of a people’s quest for meaning, dignity and justice. The illustrations don’t just depict India’s past; they foreshadow its constitutional future. They also reveal the imagination of our founding fathers — men and women who dreamt of a document that did not merely prescribe but evoked, that did not merely legislate but inspired. In doing so, they gave us a map of memory, a charter of culture and a mirror of our moral fibre.In an age of black-andwhite binaries, these lush illustrations are a reminder that Indian constitutionalism is not a single tone; it is a rainbow of responsibilities and rights, shades of heritage and hope. Such images comprise an unspoken preamble, another level of overture — a visual message of the part of the mind that believes, that preps the soul before the brain engages. This document is not just a blueprint for governance. It is a mirror of our moral inheritance.Where other constitutions speak in articles and amendments, ours breathes through allegory and art. This is not ornamental. It is transformative. The illustrated Constitution serves as a counter-narrative to the sterile image of law. It reveals that justice, too, can be beautiful. Democracy, too, can be drawn. Nationhood, too, can be painted.These illustrations also turn the Indian Constitution into an entity reflecting India’s unique constitutional identity. What other Constitution dares to blend Shiva’s cosmic dance with federal finance, or show Akbar while listing bureaucratic services? Where else do deserts, oceans and ancient sculptures frame legal architecture? The uniqueness of our illustrated Constitution lies in its fusion of text and texture, its legal gravitas softened by visual grace. It is India’s original ‘living document’, long before the courts used that phrase.The manuscript’s USP is its humanity, its ability to speak to citizens as much through sight as through statute. It underscores an oft-ignored truth: a Constitution is not just a legal contract; it is a cultural compact. It must speak to the head and the heart, to the reason and the rasa (aesthetic essence). The illustrated Constitution accomplishes this with quiet dignity.In an era of quick fixes and digital templates, the Indian Constitution’s illustrated version is a slow, deliberate and divine act of nation-building. It reflects the care with which India imagined herself. Not just legally, but visually, morally and spiritually.The 22 illustrations are India’s constitutional haiku — short, symbolic and stirring. They are not footnotes. In their silence, they speak. In their stillness, they move. And in their artistry, they awaken a nation’s conscience. They make the Indian Constitution a testament to timelessness.","As we turn 76 as a constitutional republic, we should underline a lesserknown and unique facet of the gita and the bible of our governance.

NEW DELHI: With the Iran crisis simmering, IndiGo has cancelled its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku flights till Jan 28. Air India, which had been overflying the safer eastern parts of Iran on its flights to and from North America, will now examine the situation once the same resume after the snowstorm on the east coast in a day or so.“In view of the prevailing situation and after careful assessment, IndiGo flights scheduled to operate on Jan 26, 27 and 28, 2026, to and from Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku have been cancelled,” IndiGo said on X Sunday.Air India flights to and from Europe had stopped overflying Iran after a Jan 16 advisory from European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). “Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within (Iranian airspace). The presence and possible use of a wide range of weapons and air-defence systems, combined with unpredictable state responses and the potential activation of SAM systems, creates a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels…. Air operators should not operate within the airspace of Iran at all altitudes and flight levels,” EASA advisory had said.AI has since then not been overflying Iran on flights to and from Europe as the advisory is for ""third country operators authorised by EASA, when conducting operations to, from and within the EU.” AI and many other airlines are overflying Iraq. Once East Coast flights resume, AI will take a call based on the situation that time regarding overflying the safer eastern part of Iran.The situation is dynamic and airlines are taking decisions in real time, very frequently changing course of their enroute flights in troubled West Asia","Indigo has cancelled its tbilisi, almaty, tashkent and baku flights till jan 28.

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new h-1b stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

""A Game-Changer for Trade and Defense"" Expert on India-EU Free Trade Agreement

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi’s discussions with EU leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said as he welcomed European Council and Commission presidents, Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen respectively, in a meeting.The leaders, who were treated to a ceremonial welcome Sunday shortly after Costa’s arrival, will attend the January 26 Republic Day parade as chief guests, ahead of the 16th EU-India summit on Tuesday. The summit takes place at a time Europe’s transatlantic alliance is under strain and India too is in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s trade policies.Shortly after the welcome ceremony, von der Leyen said in a post on X India and Europe had made a clear choice – the choice of strategic partnership, dialogue and openness. “Leveraging our complementary strengths. And building mutual resilience.We are showing a fractured world that another way is possible,” said the president.The summit will see four major outcomes – successful conclusion of the FTA negotiations although the deal itself would be signed later, signing of a security and defence partnership that von der Leyen in an interview to TOI described as a likely game-changer, an agreement to promote mobility and adoption of a 2026-2030 joint comprehensive strategic agenda.Jaishankar later also met his counterpart Kaja Kallas and said the talks reflected growing comfort and strong convergences.According to senior EU officials accompanying the leaders, both sides were closing in on the conclusion of the trade talks that would result in the “mother of all deals”. Von der Leyen had told TOI ahead of her arrival EU was committed to finding workable, mutually beneficial solutions on issues such as CBAM (EU carbon border tax), automobiles, and steel.According to Brussels, the new strategic agenda will look to ramp up cooperation across 4 key pillars - prosperity and sustainability, technology and innovation, security and defence and connectivity and global issues.Under the new security and defence partnership, which the EU has so far signed with only 8 “trusted and like-minded countries, both sides will also announce the launch of negotiations for a Security of Information Agreement that would facilitate the exchange of classified information. Von der Leyen, however, also told TOI while the partnership will help diversify military supply chains and improve access to new capabilities, EU member-states will retain their authority on export of high-end technology. “The export of high-end defence technology is, and will remain, a national competence,” she had said. The partnership will allow both sides to eplore defence industrial collaboration and facilitate India’s participation in EU security and defence initiatives in line with EU Treaty-based frameworks.With the new mobility agreement, EU is also hoping to attract more highly skilled professionals, researchers and students to Europe, while blocking illegal migration. In all, 8-10 agreements are expected to be signed at the summit. The ministry of external affairs called India-EU relations a partnership of trust and reliability.The strategic agenda along with a joint statement will reaffirm both sides’ commitment to effective multilateralism and a free and open Indo-Pacific. The leaders will also discuss the need to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end and the situation in West Asia. EU leaders are likely to urge Modi to provide more humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.","Pm narendra modi's discussions with eu leaders this week will herald a new chapter in bilateral ties, external affairs minister s jaishankar said.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday awarded group captain Shubhanshu Shukla - who became the first Indian to set foot on the International Space Station - with Ashoka Chakra -- India's highest peacetime gallantry award.Shukla spent 18 days in space and became the second Indian to have gone to space and the first to visit the ISS as part of the historic Axion-4 mission. This came 41 years after Rakesh Sharma flew aboard the Russian Soyuz-11 space mission.Shukla served as the pilot for the Axiom Mission-4 (Ax-4) to the ISS and left an indelible mark on India's remarkable advancements in human space exploration.As a fighter pilot, Shukla has an impressive record of 2,000 hours of flight experience across various aircraft, including the Su-30 MKI, MiG-21, MiG-29, Jaguar, Hawk, Dornier and An-32.The Axiom-4 mission was executed by US-based private firm Axiom Space and it involved the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).Additionally, the President Droupadi Murmu approved awards and 301 military decorations and gallantry awards to 70 armed forces personnel, including six who would receive the honour posthumously.These include one Ashoka Chakra, three Kirti Chakra, 13 Shaurya Chakra, including one posthumous, one Bar to Sena Medal (gallantry), 44 Sena Medals (gallantry), six Nao Sena Medals (gallantry) and two Vayu Sena Medals.Two women officers of the Indian Navy -- Lieutenant Commander Dilna K and Lieutenant Commander Roopa A -- were honoured with the Shaurya Chakra award, months after they made history by completing an extraordinary expedition to circumnavigate the globe, covering 21,600 nautical miles (approx 40,000 km) over an eight-month period onboard Indian Naval Sailing Vessel (INSV) Tarini.The Shaurya Chakra is India's third-highest peacetime gallantry award after the Ashoka Chakra and the Kirti Chakra.The Kirti Chakra has been conferred on Major Arshdeep Singh from 1 Assam Rifles, Naib Subedar Doleshwar Subba from 2 Para (Special Forces) and Group Captain Prashanth Balakrishnan Nair.Nair was one of the four astronauts who underwent training for India's first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan.The decision to confer the Ashoka Chakra on Shukla is seen as the government's recognition of the importance of the space sector as the coveted honour is generally bestowed on military personnel for showing ""most conspicuous bravery"".The President approved to armed forces and other personnel.",Shubhanshu shukla became the first indian to set foot on the international space station.

Throwback 25: Five Indian Weapons That Crushed Terror And Dominated Pakistan in Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: India’s air superiority during its “88-hour Operation Sindoor coerced Pakistan into a ceasefire” during the May 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed European military analysis.The report, titled ‘Operation Sindoor: The India-Pakistan Air War (7–10 May 2025)’, has been authored by Adrien Fontanellaz and was published last week by the Centre d’Histoire et de Prospective Militaires (CHPM), an independent Swiss military history and strategic studies institution based in Switzerland. Founded in 1969, CHPM is not affiliated with any govt and positions itself as a neutral forum for professional military research.Referring to last year’s Indo-Pak conflict, the report said, “This (May 2025) clash between the Pakistan and Indian air force s initially saw the former achieve a clear tactical victory by shooting down several enemy fighters, then largely fail in its conduct of strikes over Indian territory, as those were countered by an integrated air defence system whose effectiveness was one of the surprises of the conflict. Conversely, the Indian Air Force managed to significantly degrade the enemy's air defence system, then concluded the conflict by carrying out a series of spectacular strikes against Pakistan’s principal Air Force stations.Thus, by achieving clear air superiority, India coerced Islamabad into requesting a ceasefire .”Though the Indian govt never admitted losing any fighter aircraft, including Rafale, in the conflict, the report said, “The loss of at least one Indian Rafale fighter jet on the night of 7 May 2025, can be seen as the tip of the iceberg as this event, above all, made a strong impression in the West and attracted significant media attention. However, this sequence saw a large-scale confrontation between two competent air forces, equipped with small fleets of state-of-the-art aircraft designs, such as the J10C and the Rafale, supported by substantial fleets of fourth-generation combat aircraft as well as sophisticated integrated air defence networks and force multipliers. ”On the escalation of war, the report stated, “On the strategic plane, Operation Sindoor has led to conventional military clashes of considerable magnitude between two de facto nuclear-weapon states with differing doctrines regarding the use of nuclear weapons, which made the situation very tricky to handle, with a high risk of escalation and potentially catastrophic consequences.”“This episode provides valuable lessons on the tactical and operational plans, particularly because it illustrates the strong interpenetration between the military and communication lines of operation, as well as a paradigm that has been consistently confirmed over the years, namely the crucial role of long-range strikes,” the report further added.","India’s air superiority during its “88-hour operation sindoor coerced pakistan into a ceasefire” during the may 7-10, 2025 conflict, according to a detailed european military analysis.

NEW DELHI: Mark Tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from India, died at a private hospital in Delhi on Sunday. He was 90. He had been unwell for some time and was admitted to Max Hospital in Saket last week.Born in 1935 in Tollygunge, Kolkata, to British parents, Tully spent his early childhood in India. In the late 1930s, he was not allowed to socialise with local people. Ironically, India later became the centre of his life’s work.He studied at a boarding school in Darjeeling before being sent to England for further education. In a 2001 interview with the BBC after being selected for knighthood, Tully described England as “a very miserable place… dark and drab, without the bright skies of India”.The BBC reintroduced Tully to India in 1964 when it appointed him its New Delhi correspondent. This marked the beginning of his long association with the broadcaster, which lasted nearly three decades.In 1969, Tully was sent back to London after the Indian government barred the BBC following the broadcast of Phantom India, a French documentary critical of the country. He returned to Delhi in 1971 and became the BBC’s South Asia bureau chief the next year.During his career, Tully covered several defining moments in the region, including the 1971 Bangladesh war, the Emergency, the execution of former Pakistan president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Operation Blue Star, the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, the killing of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.His first book, Amritsar: Mrs Gandhi’s Last Battle (1985), co-written with Satish Jacob, focused on Operation Blue Star and the Punjab crisis. In No Full Stops in India (1988), he wrote, “The stories I tell in this book will, I hope, serve to illustrate the way in which Western thinking has distorted and still distorts Indian life.”Tully went on to write 10 books, both fiction and non-fiction, including India in Slow Motion (2002), India’s Unending Journey (2008), and India: The Road Ahead.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1992, knighted in 2002, and received the Padma Bhushan in 2005.Tully resigned from the BBC in 1994 after publicly criticising the organisation’s internal culture. However, he remained based in Delhi and continued writing as a freelance journalist.On his 90th birthday in October, his son Sam Tully wrote on LinkedIn: “I think my father’s achievements are particularly significant for UK-India ties because of his abiding ties and affection for both countries… ‘Dil hai Hindustani, magar thoda Angrezi bhi!’”","Mark tully, one of the most well-known journalists to report from india, died at a private hospital in delhi on sunday. He had been unwell for some time and was admitted to max hospital in saket last week.

On Vande Mataram

On Netaji

On women

Collective contribution

Tribal Empowerment

Farmers

Economic Growth and Reform

National voters' day

Digital India

Operation Sindoor

President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday addressed the nation on the eve of the 77th Republic Day, highlighting the pillars of India’s democracy, the legacy of national icons, and the collective efforts of citizens in building a stronger nation.She spoke about the Constitution’s ideals, the cultural and patriotic significance of Vande Mataram, and the inspiration of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.The president further talked about the achievements of women, the contributions of farmers, tribal communities, workers, and youth, as well as India’s economic growth and reforms.“The ideals of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity enshrined in our Constitution define our republic. The framers of the Constitution have provided a strong foundation for the spirit of nationalism and the unity of the country through constitutional provisions.”""The great nationalist poet Subramanya Bharati composed the song ""Vande Mataram Yenbom"", in the Tamil language, meaning ""Let us chant Vande Mataram"", and connected the masses on an even larger scale with the spirit of Vande Mataram. Translations of this song in other Indian languages also became popular.Sri Aurobindo translated this song into English. Vande Mataram, composed by the venerable Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, is our lyrical national prayer. """"Two days ago, on 23rd January, the nation paid its respectful tributes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his birth anniversary. Since 2021, Netaji's Jayanti has been celebrated as 'Parakram Diwas' so that the people, especially the youth, can draw inspiration from his indomitable patriotism. Netaji's slogan 'Jai Hind' is the declaration of our national pride...""""Our women are breaking traditional stereotypes and forging ahead. They are actively contributing to the overall development of the country. More than ten crore women associated with self-help groups are redefining the process of development. Women are making their mark in every field, from agriculture to space, from self-employment to the armed forces. In the field of sports, our daughters have set new benchmarks globally. Last year in November, the daughters of India scripted a golden chapter in sporting history by winning the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup and subsequently the Blind Women's T20 World Cup. Last year, the final match of the Chess World Cup was played between two Indian women. These examples are a testament to the dominance of India's daughters in the world of sports. The people of the country are proud of them.""“The brave soldiers of our three armed forces are always vigilant to protect the motherland. Our dedicated policemen and Central Armed Police Forces personnel are always ready to ensure the internal security of our countrymen. Our farmers, the food providers, produce nutritious food for our countrymen. Our hardworking and talented women are setting new standards in many fields. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and all health workers care for the health of our countrymen. Our dedicated sanitation workers play a key role in keeping the country clean. Our enlightened teachers shape future generations. Our world-class scientists and engineers give new directions to the country's development. Our hardworking brothers and sisters rebuild the nation. Our promising youth and children, with their talent and contributions, strengthen our faith in the country's bright future… Thus, all conscious and sensitive citizens are advancing the progress of our republic.”""Under the 'National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission', more than 6 crore screenings have been conducted so far. Nearly one lakh forty thousand students are receiving education in Eklavya Model Residential Schools, and many students have performed exceptionally well in competitive examinations. Such campaigns in health and education are working to bring harmony between the traditions and modern development among the tribal communities. The 'Dharti Aaba Janajatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan' and the 'PM-JANMAN Yojana' have empowered all tribal communities, including PVTG communities.""""Our Annadata farmers are the backbone of our society and economy. Generations of hardworking farmers have made our country self-reliant in food grains. It is due to the hard work of our farmers that we are able to export agricultural products. Many farmers have presented highly impressive examples of success. Priority is being given to ensuring that our farmers receive fair prices for their produce, access to loans at lower interest rates, effective insurance coverage, good quality seeds, irrigation facilities, fertilizers for increased production, access to modern agricultural practices, and encouragement for organic farming. The 'PM Kisan Samman Nidhi"" is honouring the contribution of our farmers and strengthening their efforts.""""India is the world's fastest-growing major economy. Despite global uncertainties, India is recording continuous economic growth. We are moving towards achieving our goal of becoming the world's third-largest economy in the near future. By investing in the creation of world-class infrastructure, we are rebuilding our economic strength at a much larger scale. In this journey of shaping our economic destiny, Atma-nirbharata and Swadeshi are our guiding principles. The most important decision for the economic integration of the country after Independence, the implementation of GST, has established the system of 'One Nation, One Market. The recent decisions to make the GST system even more effective will further strengthen our economy. Four Labour Codes have been issued in the field of labour reforms. These will benefit our workers and will also accelerate the development of enterprises.""“Today, January 25th, is celebrated as National Voters' Day in our country. Our adult citizens enthusiastically cast their votes to elect their representatives. Babasaheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar believed that exercising the right to vote ensures political education. Our voters, in line with Babasaheb's vision, are demonstrating their political awareness… The increasing participation of women in voting is a powerful dimension of our republic. Women being active and empowered is extremely important for the country's development. National efforts being made for their health, education, safety, and economic empowerment have increased women's participation in many sectors.”""Beneficiaries are being directly connected to facilities through technology. 'Ease of Living' is being emphasised with the goal of improving everyday life. Efforts have been made to achieve national goals through public participation over the past decade. Important national campaigns have been transformed into mass movements. Local institutions in every village and city have been made instruments of ushering in progressive change. Building Viksit Bharat is the shared responsibility of all citizens. Society has immense power. Revolutionary changes occur when the efforts made by the government receive active support from society. For example, our people have adopted the digital payment system on a massive scale. Today, more than half of the world's digital transactions take place in India. From buying goods at the smallest shop to paying for an auto-rickshaw ride, the use of digital payments has become an impressive example for the global community. I hope that all citizens will actively participate in achieving other national goals in a similar manner.""""Last year, our country launched precision strikes against terror infrastructure through Operation Sindoor. Terror centres were destroyed, and many terrorists met their end. Our self-reliance in the field of defence powered the historic success of Operation Sindoor. At the Siachen Base Camp, I saw our brave soldiers fully prepared and motivated to defend the country even amidst extremely challenging conditions. I also had the opportunity to fly in the Sukhoi and Rafale fighter planes of the Indian Air Force. I saw the combat readiness of the Air Force. I witnessed the extraordinary capabilities of the Indian Navy's indigenously built aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant. I also sortied in the submarine INS Vaghsheer. Based on the strength of the Army, Air Force, and Navy, people have complete trust in our defence-preparedness.""","Droupadi murmu addressed the nation on the eve of the 77th republic day. She spoke about the constitution’s ideals, the cultural and patriotic significance of vande mataram, and the inspiration of netaji subhas chandra bose. She also talked about the achievements of women, the contributions of farmers, tribal communities, workers, and youth.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127479290,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-66308,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

.

.

AHMEDABAD: One Indian was caught at the US border every 20 minutes in 2025, a stark measure of how the American dream continues to pull immigrants through illegal and increasingly dangerous routes despite an aggressive crackdown.US Customs and Border Protection caught 23,830 Indians in 2025, far below the staggering 85,119 caught in 2024, yet enough to keep India among the top source countries. Most of them were single adults but agencies flagged a darker trend: a small flow of unaccompanied kids.Four years after the Jan 2022 Dingucha tragedy, when four of a Gandhinagar family froze to death while crossing from Canada to the US, kids continue to be abandoned near borders.The 2025 figures underscore a central paradox: enforcement has reduced numbers, but not the urge to try. For thousands, the promise of USA still outweighs walls, patrols and peril.US border officials link the drop to stepped-up surveillance, policy shifts under President Donald Trump and a sweeping enforcement drive by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Smuggling corridors have narrowed, patrols intensified and penalties sharpened.Still, attempts continue.“Data shows deterrence, not elimination,” said experts tracking migration flows. They point to the enduring economic and social pull of US, paired with smuggling networks that quickly rewire routes when pressure mounts.Indian agencies monitoring illegal immigration, particularly from Gujarat, echo that assessment. “There is a huge decrease due to stricter US policies and a massive crackdown by agencies, including ICE,” said a senior officer, adding, “But the numbers are still there because the aspiration of settling in US, especially among Gujaratis, continues.”Mexico remains a key pathway, but 2025 marked a visible shift north. More Indians were intercepted along the Canada-US border, reflecting how smugglers are abandoning the heavily policed Latin American corridors for riskier alternatives.“Routes via Mexico and Canada through hubs like Dubai and Istanbul were the main illegal channels. These routes are now heavily hampered,” the officer said. “People who want to illegally enter US are still trying through newer, riskier paths.”","One indian was caught at the us border every 20 minutes in 2025.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo cancelled Sunday its Tbilisi, Almaty, Tashkent and Baku services till Jan 28 and announced refuelling halts on several flights to the CIS region as rising tensions around Iran are rippling through Indian aviation, forcing flight cancellations, fuel stops and fresh route reviews.As airlines scrambled to keep aircraft out of potentially hostile airspace, IndiGo said on X: ""In view of the recent developments around Iran, we are making certain proactive changes to our flight schedules as part of our continued focus on safety.""Air India is reassessing its transcontinental operations as the situation evolves. The carrier had already stopped overflying Iran on Europe-bound routes after a Jan 16 advisory from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency warned of a heightened risk to civil aviation. ""Given the ongoing situation and the potential for US military action, which has placed Iranian air defence forces on a heightened state of alert, there is currently an increased likelihood of misidentification within Iranian airspace,"" the EASA advisory said.It warned that the possible use of surface-to-air missile systems created ""a high risk to civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels,"" urging operators to avoid Iranian airspace entirely. Air India complied on European routes, as the advisory applies to third-country operators authorised by EASA when flying to, from or within EU. Many airlines, including Air India, have instead been routing flights over Iraq. Flights to and from North America are now under review.Air India plans to reassess routing once services resume after a snowstorm disrupted operations along the US east coast.","Indigo cancels tbilisi, almaty, tashkent and baku services till jan 28.

The meeting came at a time both sides are looking to finally conclude negotiations for a bilateral trade deal that has remained elusive amidst general dissonance in bilateral ties.The delegation comprised two Republican Congressmen, Jimmy Patronis and Mike Rogers, and Democrat Adam Smith. The India-US ties witnessed a major downturn after US President Donald Trump slapped 50% tariff on Indian goods, including a 25% punitive levy over Russian oil purchases.
