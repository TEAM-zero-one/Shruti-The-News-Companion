Protecting Palk Strait’s fragile ecology crucial to India and Lanka: Justice Surya Kant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/protecting-palk-straits-fragile-ecology-crucial-to-india-and-lanka-justice-surya-kant/articleshow/124751702.cms,"Justice Surya Kant (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Justice Surya Kant, the next CJI, on Wednesday said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of Palk Strait that geographically divide India and Sri Lanka and argued that judiciaries of the two countries have given rulings that has sensitized the executive towards this goal.Speaking on the “Indo-Sri Lanka Policy Dialogue: Environmental Sustainability and Regional Cooperation” at Colombo, Justice Kant said, “Judicial pronouncements influence Executive behaviour, compel environmental reporting, and often drive policy reform. The potential for structured judicial dialogue could formalise this exchange and strengthen the normative coherence of environmental law between the two jurisdictions. ”He said the time is ripe for the two judiciaries to champion a model of regional environmental constitutionalism - recognizing that certain imminent environmental rights and duties transcend borders.“Environmental cooperation between India and Sri Lanka is not a matter of charity or diplomacy - it is a matter of survival. The Bay of Bengal does not divide us; it binds us through a shared ecological fate,” he said.Referring to routine confrontation between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen, Justice Kant said it epitomises a deeper ecological tragedy - competition for an exhausted resource base. “The impact of climate change and, consequently, rising sea levels threatens coastal zones in both Tamil Nadu and Northern Sri Lanka,” he said.Recounting the impact of the 2004 tsunami and recurring cyclones, he said both countries have experienced how environmental disasters transcend political borders. However, there is a lack of an integrated transboundary environmental governance mechanism, which may be a result of multiple factors, including inconsistent data collection, considering that environmental impact assessments rarely take cross-border effects into account, he said.India and Sri Lanka have, for centuries, been closely connected not merely by culture and trade, but by the ecology of the Indian Ocean itself, he said, adding that as environmental degradation accelerates, our shared geography imposes a collective responsibility.“The Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar are biodiversity hotspots, home to coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and endangered species. Yet these regions are under severe stress. Overfishing, destructive trawling practices, and unregulated coastal construction have caused ecosystem collapse in parts of this marine environment,” Justice Kant said.","Justice surya kant, the next cji, on wednesday said a vigorous collaborative effort must be made to protect the fragile yet crucial ecology of palk strait.

India rises to ninth spot globally in forest area: FAO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-rises-to-ninth-spot-globally-in-forest-area-fao/articleshow/124750833.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment, and maintained its third position in terms of annual net gain, showed the latest Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) report.Released every five years by UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the report’s 2025 edition noted that though overall deforestation has slowed in all regions globally in the last decade, forest ecosystems worldwide continue to face challenges as the current rate of deforestation at 10.9 million hectares per year is still too high.Fire affected an average of 261 million hectares of land annually, nearly half of which is forested, whereas insects, diseases and severe weather damaged about 41 million hectares of forests, mainly in temperate and boreal regions in 2020, the report released in Bali on Tuesday underlined.Globally, forests cover 4.14 billion hectares which accounts for nearly one-third (32 percent) of the global land area, equivalent to 0.5 hectares per person. Nearly half of the world’s forests are located in the tropics.“The achievement comes on the back of Modi government's planning and policies for protection and enhancement of the forest and massive plantation efforts by state governments,” said Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav while reacting to India’s improved global rank in 2025 compared to its previous position.Yadav on X attributed India’s achievement to the Prime Minister Modi’s call to plant trees under 'Ek Ped Ma ke Naam' (a tree in tribute to mother) campaign and “push for environmental consciousness” which, he said, are building awareness and increasing involvement of communities and individuals for afforestation. “This will ensure a greener tomorrow for generations to come,” the minister posted on Wednesday.GFRA, based on official national data, has put India’s forest cover at 72.7 million hectares in 2025, accounting for roughly 2 percent of the world forest area. According to India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023, the country’s forest cover stands at 71.5 million hectares.Globally, Russia has the highest forest cover (832.6 million hectares) followed by Brazil (486 million hectares), Canada (368.8 million hectares), the USA (308.8 million hectares), China (227 million hectares), Congo (139 million hectares), Australia (133.5 million hectares), Indonesia (96 million hectares), India (72.7 million hectares) and Peru (67 million hectares). In fact, more than half (54%) of the total world forest area is concentrated in just five countries — Russia, Brazil, Canada, the United States and China.In terms of forest expansion, China recorded the highest annual net gain in forest area between 2015 and 2025 at 1.69 million hectares per year, followed by Russia (9,42,000 hectares), India (1,91,000 hectares), Türkiye (1,18,000 ha), Australia (1,05,000 ha), France (95,900 ha), Indonesia (94,100 ha), South Africa (87,600 ha), Canada (82,500 ha) and Vietnam (72,800 ha).The assessment report shows that Asia is the only region to record an increase in forest area between 1990 and 2025, led by gains in China and India.It shows that 91 countries reported agroforestry of 55.4 million ha in 2025. The majority (39.3 million ha) of this area is in Asia, mostly South and Southeast Asia, with India and Indonesia accounting for almost 100% of the regional total and for 70% of the global total.“FRAs are the most comprehensive and transparent global evaluations of forest resources and their condition, management and uses, covering all the thematic elements of sustainable forest management. The data they produce serve multiple purposes, from informing the global community of the status of forests and their changes, to supporting decisions, policies and investments related to forests and the ecosystem services they provide,” said FAO director-general, QU Dongyu, in the foreword to the report.","India has improved its global rank to ninth in terms of forest area as compared to 10th in the previous assessment.

NEW DELHI: India may soon adopt stricter rules for power banks on board aircraft following recent instances worldwide, including one in the country, of lithium-ion batteries catching fire.On Sunday, a passenger’s power bank caught fire on a Dimapur-bound IndiGo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at Delhi airport. Now, Directorate General of Civil Aviation is “taking up this issue”, said a senior official.The regulator is learnt to be taking technical inputs on the issue. Foreign airlines are increasingly putting restrictions on power banks. Some require the power bank to be kept in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front and not in overhead bins.From Oct 1, Dubai-based Emirates “prohibited” use any power bank. While it allows a passenger to carry one power bank under 100 Watt Hours, they can neither use it to charge a device, nor charge the power bank in the aircraft cabin. The new regulations also mandate that “all power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available”.Most phones and sophisticated lithium battery-powered devices have an internal trickle system that slowly adds current into the battery to prevent overcharging, but many basic power banks may not have this safeguard.Singapore Airlines from April 1 did not allow flyers to charge power banks via onboard USB ports, or use them to charge their devices.Last week, there was a lithium battery fire on an Air China flight from China to South Korea, forcing it to be diverted to Shanghai.","On sunday, a passenger’s power bank caught fire on a dimapur-bound indigo flight when the aircraft was taxiing at delhi airport.

Indian-Origin Navjot Singh’s Heartbreaking Struggle Against Deportation To A Country He Doesn’t Know

Poll Do you believe the current immigration laws in New Zealand are fair? Yes, they are fair No, they need reform





The New Zealand government has decided to deport 18-year-old Navjot Singh to India as he does not have any legal status in the country though he was born and raised in New Zealand, and never left the country. The situation stemmed from a law that ended birthright citizenship and said those who born in New Zealand after 2006 to parents without lawful immigration status are not legal in New Zealand.Navjot Singh was born in Auckland in 2007 to Indian-origin parents who overstayed their visa. His father was deported when he was just five days old and his mother lost her legal status in 2012 when he was just five years old. He got to know about his situation when he was eight years old as he learned that he will never get access to education, healthcare and basic rights in New Zealand.But he is scared to leave New Zealand as he has friends there. He also thinks he will struggle to survive in India as he does not speak Hindi. He said he heard that people with higher qualification can't find jobs in India and he's never gone to school.Singh's request for residency through ministerial intervention was recently denied by associate immigration minister Chris Penk, RNZ reported.Immigration lawyer Alastair McClymont, representing Singh, called the decision “inhumane” and urged the government to adopt a fairer approach.“It makes no sense to deport children who have grown up here to a foreign country,” he said to RNZ. McClymont said the government should align its laws with those of countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom, which grant citizenship to children who have lived there for 10 years.Also read: $100,000 H-1B visa fee: Who pays, who doesn’t?

NEW DELHI: Punjabi singer Teji Kahlon was shot in Canada in an attack claimed by associates of gangster Rohit Godara, highlighting an ongoing transnational gang feud.In a social media post, the men named Mahender Saran Dilana, Rahul Rinau, and Vicky Phalwan said Kahlon was targeted for allegedly supplying weapons and money to rival gangs and acting as an informant.""We carried out the shooting in Canada at Teji Kahlon. He was shot in the stomach. If he understands, fine. If not, next time we will finish him,"" the statement read.The post accused Kahlon of providing financial support and arms to competing gangs and of informing on their members. Local authorities in Canada are investigating the attack.Earlier this month, 40-year-old businessman Ramesh Rulania was shot dead while exercising at a gym in Rajasthan’s Kuchaman town.Police said the assailant entered the gym around 5:20 am and shot Rulania at close range before fleeing.

Despite the recent show of bonhomie between PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump, India and the US again seemed at odds over talks between the leaders as the Indian government denied that they discussed Pakistan in Trump’s Diwali phone call to Modi.It’s also learnt that India is exploring the possibility of Modi addressing the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings in Malaysia virtually later this week, apparently because of the elections in Bihar. This would rule out any likelihood in the near future of an in-person encounter with Trump. The US president said this week he will be in Malaysia for the annual event. He is unlikely to travel though to South Africa for the G20 summit next month, where Modi will be present.Modi has rarely skipped in-person participation in the Asean/ East Asia summit meetings. The PM had earlier this month declined Egypt’s invitation for the Gaza peace summit that was co-chaired by Trump. India has not been enthused by the prospect of a meeting with Trump in the absence of any breakthrough in the trade negotiations, as also the president’s claims ad nauseam about having ended a war between India and Pakistan, but government sources said the likely decision to opt out of in-person participation may also be related to the focus on Bihar elections Trump said at a Diwali event on Tuesday that he had spoken to Modi and that they had also discussed the need to avoid a war between India and Pakistan. The PM had later in a post on X expressed hope that the 2 countries will stand united against terrorism in all its forms, venting India’s concerns about Islamabad’s growing proximity with Washington under Trump but without naming Pakistan.“Pakistan was not discussed during the phone call between the PM and President Trump,” said a source here, on condition of anonymity.This was the second time in the past 2 weeks that India has denied Trump’s claim that he has tagged to conversations with Modi. India had said last week it wasn’t aware of the conversation between Modi and Trump during which, according to Trump, the Indian PM assured him India would stop buying oil from Russia.The India-US relationship has been making headlines because of the differences over trade but Trump’s unabashed courting of Pakistan has also been a source of unease in bilateral ties for India. Even as India maintains that the ceasefire after Operation Sindoor in May was directly negotiated between the 2 militaries, Trump has not backed down from his claim that he ended the conflict with his threat to impose trade tariffs on India and Pakistan. The relationship saw a dramatic downturn after Modi declined Trump’s invitation in June this year to visit the White House. The visit was always a non-starter for Modi, as Pakistan army chief Asim Munir was also being feted there at the same time.",India is exploring the possibility of modi addressing the asean/ east asia summit meetings in malaysia virtually later this week.

India to Belgian court: Arthur Rd jail has long walking area, fresh air with cross ventilation



NEW DELHI: Behind the cold steel bars, a surprisingly plush interior awaits one of India’s most wanted fugitives. Photographs presented by India to Belgium to secure Mehul Choksi ’s extradition reveal a dwelling place that's more akin to a boutique hotel room than a jail cell. The gleaming bathroom and tiled area are a far cry from the stark, unforgiving ambience one typically associates with prison life.Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be lodged at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai upon extradition and the cell he will be lodged in has been spruced up to adhere to European standards of prisoner management. The photographs provided by India also offer a glimpse of the prison barrack (number 12), which houses Choksi’s cell. There are two cells with special facilities and Choksi will be kept in one of them post-extradition.“The barrack is protected by a steel structure after clearing the ground level of 20 feet on three sides so as to allow free passage of light and air inside the jail. The wide corridor leads to the cell.Police personnel are deployed round the clock for security and any emergency, the document submitted by the Indian govt states.Regarding the cell where Mehul Choksi will be lodged, the document says: “The cell has sufficient sources of natural light. The cell has one main door, three windows and five upper ventilators which ensure fresh air with cross ventilation.Once the lights are switched on, six hanging tube lights provide sufficient light in the cell. The three ceiling fans are there to maintain enough air circulation. A TV is also provided for news and entertainment.”The Indian prosecutors have also submitted (with images) to the Belgian court handling Choksi’s case that an attached passage from the cell leads to the toilet, which is equipped with all essential amenities. “There is a long walking area for the inmates outside the Barrack where they can take a stroll in the mornings or evenings,” the document adds.The development comes on the heels of the Union home minister urging all states to have at least one prison cell of international standards to deal with fugitives. The Belgian court recently upheld Choksi’s arrest — which happened at the Indian govt’s request — and ordered his extradition. It observed that the documents produced by Choksi to cite poor jail conditions were of Tihar prison and do not apply to his case.The court also observed that there was no “documentary evidence” to prove Choksi was kidnapped in Antigua in May 2021 on the instructions of Indian authorities and dismissed the charge that his extradition was being sought for a political or military offence.Choksi (65), wanted in bank fraud cases to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore, is learnt to be in process of filing an appeal against the extradition order.",Fugitive diamantaire mehul choksi will be lodged at the arthur road jail in mumbai upon extradition.

Army To Raise First 5 Bhairav Commando Units By Oct 31 For Swift Strikes On China, Pak Fronts

NEW DELHI: From inducting modern sniper rifles, machine guns, carbines, rocket-launchers, loitering munitions, tank-killing missiles and software-defined radios to raising new `Bhairav’ light commando units and `Ashni’ drone platoons, the Army is now progressively transforming its 382 infantry battalions to meet the myriad challenges of tech-driven warfare.“Multiple initiatives, institutional measures and technology transformations are being undertaken. The focus is on lethality, mobility, battlefield transparency, situational awareness, survivability, training and restructuring,” director general of infantry Lt-General Ajay Kumar said on Wednesday.The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot-soldiers, who are often forgotten in the race to acquire big-ticket fighter jets, submarines and howitzers, to “fight as weapon systems”.The infantry is by far the largest arm of the 11.5 lakh Army. Moreover, boots on the ground will always be relevant because victory in conflicts, be it Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas, will continue to be measured in the amount of land or real estate captured, Lt-Gen Kumar said.Towards this end, the Army has inked a wide array of deals for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) drones, kamikaze drones, loitering munitions for precision strikes, night sights, bullet-proof jackets, ballistic helmets, foliage-penetration radars, light specialist and all-terrain vehicles, among others.The latest is the Rs 2,770 crore contract for 4.2 lakh close-quarter battle carbines, 60% to be manufactured by Bharat Forge and the rest by PLR Systems (Adani Defence-Israel Weapon Industries joint venture). “Deliveries will start in a year and be completed in two years,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Similarly, with there being a huge deficiency in new-generation man-portable ATGMs, emergency procurements of a limited number of launchers and missiles are being undertaken till a viable indigenous option is available. One such deal is for 12 Javelin launchers and 104 missiles from the US.“The recent graduation to the philosophy of `shoot-to-kill’ (from the earlier shoot-to-wound) has also enabled upgrade of assault rifles and light machine guns from 5.56mm to 7.62mm calibre. Vintage sniper rifles are also being replaced with .338 sniper rifles,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.With drone warfare redefining the nature of conflicts, the infantry is also trial-evaluating nine different types of drones for ISR and `suicide’ missions, in addition to the deals already inked.This is also in tune with ongoing force restructuring under which all 382 infantry battalions (each has 800 soldiers) have now raised “first person view” Ashni drone platoons as part of the “eagle on the arm” concept. “Each platoon of 20-25 specially trained soldiers will have surveillance as well as short and medium-range loitering munitions,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.Parallelly, the infantry has also raised the first five `Bhairav’ light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China, as was first reported by TOI.“The raising of another four has started. In the next six months, we will have 25 such lean and mean battalions capable of carrying out deep strikes against high-value enemy targets. The aim is to bridge the gap between infantry units and Para-Special Forces,” Lt-Gen Kumar said.The first five units, equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones, have been placed under the 3 Corps (Dimapur), 12 Corps (Jodhpur) 14 Corps (Leh), 15 Corps (Srinagar) and 16 Corps (Nagrota).These Bhairav units are in addition to the Army’s 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training and are equipped with a wide array of specialized weapons and equipment.","The aim is to equip, upskill and enhance the capability of the humble foot-soldiers.

NEW DELHI: London-based academician and researcher Francesca Orsini was on Monday denied entry into India upon arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here, as she “was blacklisted in March this year for having violated the conditions of her tourist visa by undertaking research during her previous visits”, according to govt sources.Orsini, Professor Emerita of Hindi and South Asian Literature at the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics in London, is a literary historian working with Hindi and Urdu texts and has been researching into how multilingualism works within the literary cultures of South Asia. Orsini had reportedly arrived in Delhi from Hong Kong before she was deported.“She was denied entry in line with the visa rules. It had come to the agencies’ notice that she was doing research projects while in India on a tourist visa. This is a clear violation of her visa conditions. As per standard global practice, if a person is found violating visa conditions, he or she can be blacklisted,” a senior govt official told TOI. To undertake research in India, a foreign national must have an ‘R’ visa.As some prominent persons, including Opposition MPs, took to X to slam Orsini’s deportation without being offered a reason as mark of “a govt that is insecure, paranoid and even stupid,” officials stressed that it is every nation’s sovereign right to admit or deny entry to a foreigner.“In this case, the subject was blacklisted and offering an explanation is not mandatory while deporting a blacklisted person,” said the official.In Feb last year, another UK academic, Nitasha Kaul, was deported upon arrival at Bengaluru airport on the basis of a preventive lookout circular opened against her after Indian agencies flagged her consistent “pro-separatist” comments and “anti-India” line on Kashmir on public fora. Her ‘overseas citizen of India’ was also cancelled later.An application for R visa must specify the subject or topic of the research project, details of places to be visited in India during the project period, details of any previous visits to India, certificate of affiliation from a recognised Indian university or institution and evidence of financial resources to meet the expenses for stay in India.","Visa breach ends india visit for blacklisted uk scholar and hindi literature expert francesca orsini.

NEW DELHI: Seeking government's intervention at multilateral forum to protect India's sovereign rights over its genetic resources, a group of scientists/experts on Wednesday wrote to Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan urging him to mobilise the Global South to jointly demand a ""fair and equitable"" share of profits earned by users of genetic resources in the technology-rich Global North.They sought India's leadership role at the upcoming 11th governing body meeting of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) in Peru next month.Genetic resources are shared under law for research and advancements in medicine and agriculture. It is largely believed that the full access to such resources, instead of a negotiated access, could significantly compromise a nation’s sovereign rights over its own genetic resources and override domestic legislation, like India’s Biodiversity Act.“We believe that securing a just and mandatory system for benefit-sharing is fundamental to protecting the welfare of our farming communities and asserting India’s sovereign control over its genetic resources,” said the scientists/experts - Suman Sahai, Dinesh Abrol, Soma Marla and Sarath Babu Balijepalli - in their joint letter to the minister.They underlined that the current system of voluntary sharing of monetary benefits has proven to be a complete failure.“It is therefore very clear that the Treaty's financial mechanism, based on voluntary contributions, is unsustainable and unjust,” they wrote.Referring to the failure of voluntarism, they noted that approximately seven million accessions have been transferred under the Multilateral System (MLS). “These resources, originating largely from the Global South, have driven billions of dollars in commercial value for the global industries. Yet, the corresponding payment for this immense contribution has been minimal,” they said.The group flagged that if the issues remain unresolved and the government chooses to compromise on the mandated objectives of negotiations, the Global South would end up offering genetic wealth on a platter without securing gains of monetary compensation and non-monetary benefits of technology transfer.","A group of scientists/experts wrote to union agriculture minister shivraj singh chouhan.

"India restores embassy in Kabul, Taliban to appoint 2 diplomats in Delhi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-taliban-ministers-visit-kabul-embassy-restored/articleshow/124729352.cms,"India Upgrades Technical Mission In Kabul To Full Embassy After Afghan FM Muttaqi’s Delhi Visit

NEW DELHI: India restored its embassy in Kabul Tuesday, following the announcement during Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India that it would upgrade its technical mission to the level of embassy. As per the understanding reached between the 2 sides, India will designate the head of the mission in Kabul as chargé d'affaires, eventually appointing an ambassador, and the Taliban are expected to send 2 diplomats to New Delhi by November this year.The diplomats will work out of the Afghan embassy here, even in the absence of a formal recognition by India of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the name used by Taliban for Afghanistan. The elevation of diplomatic ties clears the path for expansion of economic cooperation between the 2 countries, allowing India to contribute more meaningfully to the development of Afghanistan, even as its position on recognition remains largely aligned with that of the international community.Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India and the decision to ramp up diplomatic ties came in the middle of mounting tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan that saw deadly border skirmishes while Muttaqi was still in India.“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan Foreign Minister to India, the Government is restoring the status of the Technical Mission of India in Kabul to that of Embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said the Indian government in a statement, adding the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.The government also said that the embassy will further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance, and capacity-building initiatives, in line with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society.India had shut its embassy after the return of the Taliban to Kabul in August, 2021. However, following security assurances from Kabul, India started to run a technical mission from the premises in June 2022, mainly to oversee distribution of Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.The Taliban see Muttaqi’s visit as marking a new phase in the relationship. Significantly, both sides committed to respecting each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and, in a message to Pakistan, also unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from “regional countries”. Taliban’s backing of India’s sovereignty over J&K had also angered Pakistan, leading to lodging of a formal protest by Islamabad with Kabul.Earlier this week, the Taliban also dismissed Pakistani claims about India’s role in fomenting tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as baseless and illogical.""These accusations are groundless. Our policy will never involve using our territory against other countries. We maintain relations with India as an independent nation and will strengthen those ties within the framework of our national interests,” said Afghanistan’s defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob. The 2 countries agreed to a ceasefire this week after talks in Doha.“At the same time, we will preserve our relations with Pakistan based on good neighborliness. Our aim is to expand relations, not create tensions. Pakistan’s accusations are unfounded, illogical, and unacceptable,” added the minister.Aligning with the global community on the issue of recognition for the Taliban government, India has also continued to raise issues related to the need for a more inclusive government in Afghanistan and respect for rights of women and children. Russia remains the only country to have formally recognised the government in Kabul, while others like China and Pakistan have accepted Taliban ambassadors and diplomats.","India upgrades technical mission in kabul to full embassy after afghan fm muttaqi’s delhi visit.

Doug Martin, a former NFL running back who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders, died last week at the age of 36 after being taken into police custody in Oakland, California. Martin was a two-time Pro Bowl player and rushed for over 5,300 yards in his seven-year NFL career.

Bad Bunny’s witty response to haters

NFL stands firm in their decision

The NFL just threw the ultimate curveball, and the internet is losing it. Bad Bunny is officially headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show on February 8, 2026, and, as expected, some corners of the political world aren’t having it. President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson have publicly criticized the pick, calling it “crazy” and “terrible.” But NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell? He’s not budging and he’s not here for the drama.Roger Goodell is doubling down on the decision, calling Bad BunnyThe commissioner explained that the choice was “carefully thought through” to deliver a halftime show that’s memorable, high-energy, and culturally impactful.The NFL has a long history of catching heat for halftime performances from controversial acts to bold surprises but Goodell insists the league is confident this is a “great show” that will unite viewers across demographics.Simply put: the NFL knows it’s impossible to please everyone, and they’re leaning into it.Unsurprisingly, the backlash has been loud. Trump slammed the pick as “absolutely ridiculous” and admitted he didn’t even know who Bad Bunny was.Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson called the choice “terrible” and suggested 82-year-old country singer Lee Greenwood as a more “patriotic” alternative.The controversy even reached Greenwood himself, who reacted diplomatically, essentially saying he appreciated the thought but didn’t expect to step into the halftime spotlight. The political critiques are clear, some conservatives see the choice as a cultural mismatch for the NFL’s biggest stage.Bad Bunny didn’t stay silent. On “Saturday Night Live,” he jokingly told critics to learn Spanish before judging him. Beyond the humor, he also highlighted the cultural significance of his performance, framing it as a celebration of Latino heritage and contributions to American culture.Fans of the Puerto Rican superstar have cheered, seeing the halftime show as a historic moment for Latin representation in U.S. sports and pop culture. Bad Bunny’s message is clear: he’s bringing his culture, energy, and artistry to a stage watched by millions, and he’s doing it unapologetically.Despite the political firestorm, Goodell is unshaken. The NFL has officially reaffirmed the show, promising fans a performance that will be “a united moment” for viewers across the country.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





“America’s innovation economy depends on both strong domestic talent and access to a highly skilled workforce from abroad.” With this opening line, seven US lawmakers — Democrats and Republicans — have written to President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, urging them to reconsider the administration’s plan to impose a $ 100,000- fee on new H-1B visa petitions.As per the recent guidance update by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), new H-1B petitions, filed for consular processing, where the worker is outside the US will trigger the $100,000 payment requirement This payment is to be made upfront at the time of the H-1B visa application by the sponsoring employer, a refund is available only if the visa application is denied.The letter, sent on Tuesday, warns that the fee will not curb abuse of the H-1B visa system, but will instead shut out start-ups, slow innovation, and push skilled workers — many from India — to competing countries.The letter is signed by Suhas Subramanyam, son to Indian immigrant parents, other members of the US Congress who have joined in signing the letter include Sam T Liccardo, Jay Obernolte, María Elvira Salazar, Don Bacon and Greg Stanton.The lawmakers concede that the H-1B programme needs reform, but point out that the imposition of a $ 100,000 entry fee is too expensive and will have adverse impact. They note that early-stage technology firms and research-driven companies, which depend heavily on foreign-born engineers and scientists, will simply not be able to afford the fee.They caution that while large corporations may absorb the cost, smaller companies will be forced to cancel job offers, move projects abroad or stop hiring foreign workers altogether. According to the letter, the proclamation “will bar rapidly scaling American start-ups from recruiting and retaining critically needed talent”, undermining their growth and “reducing employment of US citizens by those same employers”.The growing support against the fee imposition, is particularly relevant to India, whose nationals receive around 60 per cent of all H-1B visas issued every year. Thousands of Indian students studying in the United States on F-1 and OPT visas transition to H-1B status to begin employment. As per USCIS’s guidance note, any employer filing a fresh H-1B petition for someone outside the US must pay 100,000 dollars upfront. Those already in the country on H-1B, or applying for extensions or amendments, are exempt. The fee also does not apply in case of transition from a F-1 (student visa) to an H-1B, while in the US. However, new graduates who return to India for visa stamping or travel could be caught in the net.The letter draws attention to a larger strategic risk: if the US makes it harder for skilled immigrants to stay, they will return to countries like India, China, Israel or those in Europe and launch companies that directly compete with American firms. It points out that China already produces nearly half of the world’s top artificial intelligence researchers, more than double the number in the US, and is expanding visa options to attract global STEM talent. Canada promises high-skill visas in under two weeks, Germany has signed a labour mobility agreement with India, and China has introduced a new “K” visa for young technology professionals. “Other nations see the opportunity presented by our shift,” the lawmakers write, “and they’re seizing it.”They argue that high-skilled immigration has historically been America’s strength. Nearly half of all US start-ups valued at over a billion dollars — the so-called “unicorns” — were founded by immigrants, and many of today’s biggest technology firms were unable to make profits during their early years and would not have survived if such a fee had existed. The letter cites research showing that start-ups which successfully hire H-1B workers file more patents, attract more funding, and hire more Americans.Instead of the significant entry fee, the lawmakers propose targeted reforms: stricter action against outsourcing firms that replace US workers with lower-paid employees, visa portability to allow H-1B holders to change jobs freely, better enforcement, updated wage and skill classifications, and a more reasonable fee structure. Their appeal is not to scrap reform, but to avoid a policy that they say will harm the very companies and workers the US economy depends on.For India, this debate is more than policy politics in Washington. It affects tens of thousands of engineering graduates, IT professionals, medical researchers and families who aspire to work in the US. It influences decisions by Indian technology companies and start-ups that operate in both Bengaluru and Silicon Valley. If the rule holds, job offers may be withdrawn, visas delayed, and future plans derailed. If it is struck down or modified, the pathway for Indian talent to the United States — already narrowed by backlogs and lottery systems — may remain open, but not unchanged.As the lawmakers write in closing, high-skilled immigrants “play a vital role in strengthening our economy, advancing American competitiveness, and expanding opportunities for US citizens”. They urge the President to work with Congress to modernise the system, not seal it off.Two separate lawsuits have been filed in US district courts, aiming to block the $100,000 fee imposed by Donald J Trump’s proclamation. The outcome of these legal challenges is still awaited.","Seven us lawmakers have written to president donald trump and commerce secretary howard lutnick, urging them to reconsider the administration’s plan to impose a $ 100,000- fee on new h-1b visa petitions.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-mohammed (jem) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

When people think of the Burj Khalifa, they often imagine Dubai’s royal family or government behind its glittering success. But the man who truly owns and built this global icon is Mohamed Alabbar, a self-made Emirati entrepreneur and founder of Emaar Properties. From humble beginnings on Dubai Creek to leading one of the world’s most successful real-estate companies, Alabbar’s journey mirrors Dubai’s own transformation, ambitious, bold, and unstoppable.The journey to building the world’s tallest tower did not begin in a palace, but in a modest home. Mohamed Alabbar, born in 1956, grew up in Dubai's Rashidiya area as the eldest of 12 children; his father was a traditional trading vessel (dhow) captain. This humble background fueled his extraordinary drive and ambition.Alabbar’s formal education took him across the world. He graduated in 1981 from Seattle University in the United States, earning a degree in Business Administration, which laid the foundation for his future empire. Upon returning to the UAE, he quickly rose through the ranks, starting at the Central Bank before becoming the founding director general of Dubai's Department of Economic Development.It was during this time that he forged a crucial, career-defining relationship with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai. Tasked with improving the Emirate’s tourism and global reputation, Alabbar used his close position as a chief economic adviser to help execute the vision of transforming Dubai into a global hub. In 1997, he founded Emaar Properties, the company that would ultimately deliver that vision.In 1997, Alabbar founded Emaar Properties, with backing from Dubai’s leadership and a vision to create world-class urban spaces. The company soon became the crown jewel of Dubai’s real estate revolution, responsible for some of the city’s most famous landmarks:Emaar’s most iconic project, however, is the Burj Khalifa, which officially opened in 2010. Standing 828 meters tall, it remains the world’s tallest building, a global symbol of innovation, ambition, and design excellence.The inspiration behind the Burj Khalifa was more than a desire to build tall — it was about symbolism and ambition. In the early 2000s, as Dubai transitioned from an oil-based economy to tourism and services, Alabbar wanted a landmark that would announce the city’s arrival on the world stage. He envisioned a building that could rival New York, Shanghai, and London — a project that would place Dubai at the center of the global map.Architecturally, the design was inspired by the Hymenocallis flower, native to the Arabian desert, whose geometric symmetry influenced the tower’s Y-shaped base. The structure was engineered by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the same firm behind Chicago’s Willis Tower, combining Islamic design elements with cutting-edge technology. Alabbar described the Burj Khalifa as “a statement of the region’s confidence and its future” — a monument representing Dubai’s openness, multicultural energy, and limitless possibility.In short, the Burj Khalifa was born from an idea of identity: to show what Dubai could achieve through vision, collaboration, and courageDespite popular belief, the Burj Khalifa is not owned by the UAE government or any royal. It is owned by Emaar Properties, the publicly traded company founded and chaired by Mohamed Alabbar. As Emaar’s founder and key shareholder, Alabbar oversaw every stage of the project from design approvals to navigating the 2008 global financial crisis that nearly halted construction.The tower’s name honors Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the late President of the UAE, in recognition of Abu Dhabi’s financial support during the crisis. Alabbar’s influence extends well beyond real estate. He has built a global business portfolio that reflects Dubai’s diversification:Through these ventures, Alabbar continues to strategically modernize Middle Eastern entrepreneurship, combining innovation, digitalization, and sustainable development. Today, the Burj Khalifa stands tall at 828 meters, housing luxury residences, corporate offices, and the world-famous At.mosphere restaurant, a living testament to Alabbar’s remarkable vision.","Discover mohamed alabbar, the visionary entrepreneur who built and owns dubai’s burj khalifa.
