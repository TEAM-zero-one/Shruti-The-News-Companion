‘Tense relationship serves neither side’: S Jaishankar on rebuilding India-China ties post-Galwan valley clashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tense-relationship-serves-neither-side-s-jaishankar-on-rebuilding-india-china-ties-post-galwan-valley-clashes/articleshow/119567775.cms,"External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said India and China are working to rebuild ties damaged by the Galwan valley clashes of 2020, but some issues remain unresolved. Speaking at an event hosted by the Asia Society, he stressed that a tense relationship benefits neither country.""It wasn't just the bloodshed, it was the disregard of written agreements...The departure from the terms of what was agreed to was very sharp and very substantial,"" Jaishankar said during a session moderated by Kyung-wha Kang, President and CEO of the Asia Society and a former foreign minister of South Korea.Jaishankar acknowledged that while the relationship has improved since October last year, certain challenges persist. ""We're still dealing with some parts of this, it is not that the issue has completely gone away,"" he said. He noted that efforts are ongoing to address the damage from the 2020 clashes, adding, ""We genuinely, sincerely think that this is in our mutual interest.""India and China reached a disengagement agreement in October for Depsang and Demchok, the last two friction points in eastern Ladakh. Days later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in Kazan, leading to decisions aimed at improving bilateral relations .Jaishankar highlighted the importance of managing differences to prevent them from turning into disputes. ""We do compete on many issues. But because we compete, it doesn't mean that there should be a conflict between us. We are very realistic about it,"" he said.Addressing the broader implications of the strained relationship, Jaishankar said, ""How do we benefit by having a very tense relationship with that large number of troops out there in a very hostile environment and on all the collateral damage which it has done to the relationship?"" He added that maintaining peace and tranquillity at the border is essential for overall ties between the two countries.","Jaishankar acknowledged that while the relationship has improved since october last year, certain challenges persist.

While Dhaka has sought a bilateral meeting, India has so far been quiet on the issue.External affairs minister S Jaishankar was earlier quoted as having told a Parliamentary committee that the request is under consideration. Govt sources said Wednesday that Modi’s bilateral engagements on the margins of the event will be announced later. India has been cagey apparently because of Dhaka’s grandstanding on sensitive issues after bilateral engagements on sensitive issues like protection of minorities and the fate of Hasina.President Droupadi Murmu too wrote to her counterpart Mohammed Shahabuddin, expressing support for a democratic, stable, inclusive, peaceful and progressive Bangladesh.“India-Bangladesh relations are multi-faceted with our cooperation encompassing diverse areas such as trade, multimodal connectivity, development partnership, power and energy, education, capacity building, cultural cooperation and people-to-people exchanges.

"'China has Deepseek, US has ChatGPT': Raghav Chadha says 'Make in India' should become 'Make AI in India'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-has-deepseek-us-has-chatgpt-raghav-chadha-says-make-in-india-should-become-make-ai-in-india/articleshow/119480687.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MP Raghav Chadha on Tuesday raised concerns in the Rajya Sabha about India's position in artificial intelligence (AI), as the United States and China continue to advance in the field. He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru. Therefore, alongside 'Make in India,' India must also move forward with 'Make AI in India ,'"" the AAP MP said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Artificial Intelligence Summit in Paris, where he said AI could help improve sectors like health, agriculture, and education.",Aam aadmi party mp raghav chadha raised concerns about india's position in artificial intelligence.

"‘Santosh’, UK’s Oscar entry, blocked in India?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/santosh-uks-oscar-entry-blocked-in-india/articleshow/119558852.cms,"Censors’ decision disappointing and heartbreaking: Suri

Santosh, the UK’s official entry in the Oscars’ international feature category and a Bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by Indian film censors, according to a report in UK daily Guardian.Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri , the film was made in India and is in Hindi. According to the Guardian report, Central Board of Film Certification refused to clear the film over concerns about its negative portrayal of police — “depicting deep-rooted misogyny, discrimination against Dalits and the normalisation of mistreatment and torture by police officers.”Several CBFC board members TOI spoke to said they were unaware of reasons behind uncertainty over the release in India. “The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India , particularly against lower caste women, and the rising tide of anti-Muslim prejudice in the country,” adds the report.Author and CBFC board member Ramesh Patange said, “I attend movie reviews once a month, and my role is limited to that. Only the chairman is privy to the board’s day-to-day functioning.” Other board members declined to comment, saying only CBFC chairperson Prasoon Joshi would speak on the issue. Efforts to contact Joshi were unsuccessful at the time of going to press.CBFC board member and filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri told TOI from Puducherry that he was unaware of any issues with the film.“In my personal capacity, not as a representative of any organisation, I feel deeply distressed that a society which considers itself the spiritual leader of the world is so insecure that it resorts to censorship. Only an insecure society censors art in any form Art, creativity, and literature form the soup that nourishes society. Without it, a society cannot grow,” said Agnihotri.The Guardian report says Sandhya Suri descibed the censors’ decision as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.It also quotes her as saying the censors had demanded a list of radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be impossible to implement, adding that the list of cuts demanded went on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems “which are deeply baked into the film”.“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work. But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision,” the Guardian report quoted Suri as saying.","Santosh, the uk’s official entry in the oscars’ international feature category and a bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by indian film censors.

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The us embassy in india is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

Bangladesh government not acknowledging persecution of minorities: MEA to Parliamentary panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-government-not-acknowledging-persecution-of-minorities-mea-to-parliamentary-panel/articleshow/119546230.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has reportedly informed a parliamentary panel that Bangladesh government has refused to recognise the systematic victimisation of minorities and has attempted to minimise the scale of violence against Hindus following Sheikh Hasina's government's departure, according to sources quoted by news agency PTI.During a presentation to the Standing Committee on External Affairs, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, the ministry reportedly highlighted increasing religious symbolism in public spaces, with extremist groups advocating for an Islamic caliphate filling the political void, sources indicated.Additionally, foreign secretary Vikram Misri provided a briefing on ""Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship"" and matters concerning the Indian diaspora globally. Subsequently, Tharoor informed the press that the discussion primarily centred on Bangladesh relations, describing it as thorough, and noted the committee's adoption of its diaspora report.The ministry revealed that Bangladesh's army chief publicly acknowledged the risks posed by internal conflicts. It noted recurring instances of mob violence, property destruction, and offences against women and minorities.According to the PTI sources, the committee was informed that Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and associates dismissed reports of minority persecution as media hyperbole, characterising them as ""political killings"" of Awami League members rather than communal violence.The ministry also indicated that working-level engagement with Bangladesh facilitates bilateral cooperation whilst addressing strategic concerns. It emphasised the importance of Bangladesh considering regional security matters whilst pursuing mutual interests.Officials stressed Bangladesh's stability as crucial for regional security, highlighting the significance of maintaining constructive bilateral relations for border safety. They expressed serious concern over the release of violent Islamic extremists previously convicted of serious offences, viewing it as a threat to regional and global security.The Indian administration has repeatedly urged the interim government to prosecute those responsible for minority-targeted violence.This report comes on the day PM Modi conveyed a message to Yunus affirming India's dedication to strengthening ties with its eastern neighbour, acknowledging Bangladesh's independence day. ""This day stands as a testament to our shared history and sacrifices, which have laid the foundation of our bilateral partnership. The spirit of the Liberation War of Bangladesh continues to remain a guiding light for our relationship, which has flourished across multiple domains, bringing tangible benefits to our peoples,"" PM Modi wrote.""We remain committed to advancing this partnership, driven by our common aspirations for peace, stability, and prosperity, and based on mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns,"" he added.Bangladesh's Independence Day, also known as National Day, marks the nation's declaration of sovereignty from Pakistan on this date in 1971. Under the leadership of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India played a significant role in the liberation of Bangladesh, known as East Pakistan at the time.","The ministry reportedly highlighted increasing religious symbolism in public spaces.

"Defence ministry inks mega Rs 6,900 crore deal for indigenous heavy-duty artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defence-ministry-inks-mega-rs-6900-crore-deal-for-indigenous-heavy-duty-artillery-guns/articleshow/119542878.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked the around Rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) and 327 high mobility 6x6 gun-towing vehicles with private sector companies Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems , in the first-ever deal for such indigenous heavy-duty howitzers.With the signing of the deal for the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS designed and developed by DRDO, the total value of capital procurement contracts inked by MoD in the ongoing fiscal stands at Rs 1.4 lakh crore. The PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the ATAGS deal on March 19, as was first reported by TOI.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh felicitated the project director of ATAGS -- which has a strike range of up to 45-km depending on the ammunition -- from DRDO’s Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment during the ceremony on Wednesday.“The procurement of this gun system marks a significant milestone in the modernization of the Army’s artillery regiments, enhancing their operational readiness along the borders with China and Pakistan. Renowned for its exceptional lethality, the ATAGS will play a crucial role in bolstering the Army's firepower by enabling precise and long-range strikes,” an official said.Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns because it had emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%. “ATAGS will replace outdated 105mm and 130mm guns. Over 65% of its components are sourced domestically, including key subsystems such as the barrel, muzzle brake, breech mechanism, firing and recoil system, and ammunition handling mechanism,” another official said.Officers say ATAGS have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, longer maintenance-free reliable operations due to their “all-electric drive technology”, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The defence ministry on wednesday inked the around rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems.

The Liberals had never revealed why they barred the three-term Liberal MP from the party’s recent leadership race or from running again in Nepean constituency, the paper said.Citing the source, the daily reported that the Canadian security intelligence service had briefed the govt about Arya’s “alleged close ties to the govt of India, including its high commission in Ottawa.”Liberal Party officials who have security clearances and had received a general CSIS briefing on foreign interference also had concerns about Arya, a Liberal source said. The decisions to remove Arya as a candidate for the leadership and Nepean nomination were solely made by the Liberal Party and were not on the advice of CSIS, sources said.Party officials, in charge of monitoring foreign meddling, found troubling inconsistencies in information that Arya had put in a confidential questionnaire, the second source said.Arya rejected the allegations that he has been influenced by India. “As a MP, I have engaged with numerous diplomats and heads of govt, both in Canada and internationally. Not once have I sought — nor been required to seek — permission from the govt to do so,” he told The Globe. At no point did former PM Trudeau or any minister raise concerns about my meetings or public statements, he said. Arya said he believes he was removed from Nepean nomination because he’s spoken out against the Khalistan movement in Canada. Last week, Arya released a letter from the Liberal Party informing him of the decision to disallow his Nepean nomination.","Indian-origin mp chandra arya’s bid to run for the party leadership and his nomination in his own ottawa nepean constituency was revoked.

Bangladesh plan to redefine ‘muktijoddha’ yet again stirs a debate in West Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-plan-to-redefine-muktijoddha-yet-again-stirs-a-debate-in-west-bengal/articleshow/119563249.cms,"KOLKATA: Fifty-four years after the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out on the night of March 25, 1971, deliberations are on to modify the definition of “bir muktijoddha (valiant freedom fighter)”, raising a debate. According to media reports, only battlefield fighters could be recognised as valiant freedom fighters, while others could be classified as ‘Liberation War Associates’.Kolkatans with ancestral links to Bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation. The definition of muktijoddhas has been altered over 10 times by now.“During the Awami League’s tenure, many fake freedom fighters were enlisted. Communist and Leftist freedom fighters did not receive recognition. The National Freedom Fighters’ Council even decided to revoke Ziaur Rahman’s ‘Bir Uttam’ title in 2021,” said Arka Bhaduri, an independent journalist who has been writing on contemporary Bangladesh affairs.“Amid numerous fake claims of being muktijoddhas, there have been instances of genuine people being ignored and not granted this recognition as many were reluctant to publicise their contributions,” said Abhijit Dasgupta, director of ‘Invincible Bravura’ on the Indian Navy’s formation of the first ‘Nau Commando’ that included eight Bengali escapees from a Pakistani submarine in 1971 during the war.Dasgupta called the amendment “after so many decades” an attempt to “deliberately confuse the contemporary youth”. Bhaduri believes all those who participated in the struggle are “freedom fighters”. “Mujib’s role in the post-1971 era was problematic, but it is undeniable that although he did not physically participate in combat, the war was fought in his name. Calling him or Tajuddin Ahmad mere supporters would be a distortion of history,” he said.Cultural activist Subha Prasad Nandi Majumdar, who is from a refugee family of 1947, described it as a “ploy to subvert the real essence of liberation struggle”.",Deliberations are on to modify the definition of ‘bir muktijoddha (valiant freedom fighter)’ kolkatans with ancestral links to bangladesh or professional experience across the border have a nuanced approach towards the deliberation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119563382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-969744,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In a Facebook post, which she initially deleted but later reposted, she spoke out against deep-seated colour and gender biases in society.The comment likened her administration to the colour black, while her predecessor and husband V Venu’s was called “white”. Without naming the person behind the remark, Muraleedharan hinted at sexism in the criticism but refused to let the insult define her.“I think it’s high time for me not to feel defensive about either the fact that I am a woman or that I am dark,” she said, according to news agency ANI. “It’s time that I own both of these and that I come out strongly. Maybe it will help those people who are going through similar feelings of insecurity and inadequacy to feel that we are worth it and we don’t need external validation.”The IAS officer, the first woman to hold the state’s top bureaucratic post, has made a career out of breaking barriers. Her message was clear: She’s not backing down.Taking to Facebook, she addressed the cultural fixation with fairness and shared a childhood memory of struggling with it. “As a four-year-old, I asked my mother whether she could put me back in her womb and bring me out again, all white and pretty,” she wrote.That perspective changed over time, thanks to her children, she said. “That black is beautiful. That black is gorgeousness. That I dig black.”Muraleedharan dismissed the remark as possibly meant in jest but called out the deeper implication.“Behind the humour, there is an entire value connotation that black is not good, that there is something wrong with it,” she told ANI. “What is wrong about black? Isn’t it more a perception than a reality? It is important to claim blackness as something worthwhile and beautiful.”Muraleedharan said beauty is not a singular thing. “The very fact of looking for a particular standard of beauty is problematic because ultimately beauty is not a single thing, it's multiple things. We should all enjoy every kind of beauty,” she said.Her response sparked a wave of support across political lines. Opposition leader VD Satheesan of Congress called her words “alarming” proof that even a high-ranking official isn’t immune to discrimination. “Even a senior IAS officer at her level expressed such thoughts, which is alarming,” Satheesan said, emphasising that biases — both overt and subtle — continue to shape perceptions.State education minister V Sivankutty of CPM praised Muraleedharan’s stand as “courageous”, adding that discrimination based on skin colour has no place in the state.","Sarada muraleedharan is the first woman to hold the state’s top bureaucratic post.

NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday sharply rejected the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) report, calling the panel an ""entity of concern"".Calling the report biased and politically motivated, the ministry of external affairs said the USCIRF's report ""continues its pattern of issuing biased and politically motivated assessments"".""We have seen the recently released 2025 Annual Report of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which once again continues its pattern of issuing biased and politically motivated assessments,"" said external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The ministry further said: ""The USCIRF's persistent attempts to misrepresent isolated incidents and cast aspersions on India's vibrant multicultural society reflect a deliberate agenda rather than a genuine concern for religious freedom"".The government said the report ""undermine India's standing as a beacon of democracy and tolerance"".""India is home to 1.4 billion people who are adherents to all religions known to mankind. However, we have no expectation that the USCIRF will engage with the reality of India's pluralistic framework or acknowledge the harmonious coexistence of its diverse communities.

In fact, it is the USCIRF that should be designated as an entity of concern,"" the ministry of external affairs said.New Delhi had previously also rejected the USCIRF report as biased, lacking objectivity, and an interference in India's sovereignty as USCIRF’s actions are politically motivated, often influenced by geopolitical considerations rather than a fair assessment.It is alleged that the USCIRF methodology is flawed, relying on unreliable sources while ignoring India’s constitutional protections for religious freedom.","India on wednesday sharply rejected the us commission on international religious freedom (uscirf) report.

Parliament is not beyond the law, says HC



Rashid's counsel counters NIA's objections



Rashid's terror funding case



NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that both the court and the Lok Sabha Speaker are fully capable of ensuring that Jammu and Kashmir MP Abdul Rashid Sheikh , also known as Engineer Rashid, currently jailed in a terror funding case , abides by the law while attending Parliament.The court later reserved its order on Rashid's plea to participate in the ongoing session.Discounting the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) concerns over losing control of the accused within Parliament premises, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, ""Let’s not see ghosts. Let’s not feel so powerless that ‘oh my God, inside Parliament he will do this or that.’ He will be in our custody. Our arms are long enough and strong enough to keep him in line.""After hearing submissions from both the NIA and Rashid’s counsel, a bench of Justices Chandra Dhari Singh and Bhambhani stated that a detailed order would be passed soon.The court suggested that the NIA’s apprehensions could be addressed by imposing stringent conditions on Rashid if he is permitted to attend the session, which runs until April 4. Rashid’s counsel clarified that his plea was not for custody parole but for permission to attend the House while remaining in custody. He assured the court that Rashid would strictly comply with any conditions imposed.The court specified that the Speaker and the secretary general of the Lok Sabha possess sufficient authority to maintain discipline inside Parliament.""We are not granting him bail. He is in custody, and our officers will be with him at all times, except where they are not allowed. He will be in the highest temple of democracy—inside Parliament. Do not undermine the power of the Speaker and the Secretary General to enforce discipline,"" Justice Bhambhani said.In response to the NIA’s insistence on Rashid’s role in the case, the bench assured, ""We do not for a moment undermine the seriousness of the allegations. National security is paramount.""The court also suggested allowing a prison or police official in plain clothes to accompany Rashid inside Parliament if necessary.Facing strong opposition from the NIA, Rashid’s counsel argued that the Parliament’s marshals would maintain strict control over his actions.""The moment he switches on his mic to say anything inappropriate, his mic will be taken away, and he will be thrown out,"" Rashid’s lawyer said.To this, Justice Singh said, ""Then it will become a national issue that his mic has been taken away and he has been thrown out by the marshals.""Rashid’s counsel also informed the court of plans to challenge a March 19 trial court order denying him regular bail.Rashid, an Independent MP from Baramulla who defeated Omar Abdullah in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, is facing trial under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a 2017 terror funding case. He was arrested by the NIA in 2019 and has been lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail since.The NIA’s case against Rashid stems from allegations that he financially aided separatists and terror groups in Jammu and Kashmir.His name surfaced during the interrogation of businessman Zahoor Watali, a co-accused in the case. A special NIA court framed charges against Rashid in 2022 under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy, sedition, and waging war against the government, along with UAPA provisions for terror funding.The Baramulla MP was previously granted interim bail for a month in September 2023 to campaign for the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections.The high court has now asked the NIA to suggest additional conditions that could be imposed if Rashid is allowed to attend Parliament, reserving its final decision.",Jammu and kashmir mp abdul rashid sheikh is currently jailed in a terror funding case.

US security breach: Trump backs staff after leaked war plan and 'European free-loading' messages

Taylor Swift’s name made an unexpected appearance in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing , but it wasn’t about music. Instead, her name came up in a serious discussion about national security and the importance of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and its allies.By bringing up the Taylor Swift case, the court made it clear: collaboration between nations isn’t just helpful—it’s absolutely necessary to prevent real-world threats.During the hearing, Senator Mark Warner (D-Virginia) pointed to a terrifying moment from last year when a terrorist plot against Taylor Swift’s concerts in Vienna was stopped. In 2024, intelligence agencies from the U.S. and Europe worked together to prevent an attack that could have endangered thousands of fans attending her Eras Tour . Three suspects with ties to the Islamic State were arrested, and three concerts were canceled as a precaution.Warner used this example to emphasize how critical it is for the U.S. to maintain strong relationships with European intelligence agencies. He reminded officials that without cooperation, tragedies like this could happen.The discussion about Swift’s Vienna concerts came amid controversy over U.S. national security officials using an unsecured messaging app to talk about sensitive military matters. A report from The Atlantic revealed that some high-ranking officials were using a group chat on Signal to discuss potential military actions, including bombing targets in Yemen. The leaked messages also included complaints about European allies, with some officials calling them ""freeloaders.""These revelations sparked outrage, with Warner criticizing officials for not only jeopardizing security but also risking relationships with important allies. The senator stressed that cooperation with other countries isn’t just about diplomacy—it actively saves lives, as seen in the Swift concert case.While Taylor Swift’s name in a Senate hearing might sound unusual, it was used to make an important point. The world is more connected than ever, and national security depends on strong alliances. Whether it’s stopping a terrorist attack at a concert or handling global conflicts, intelligence-sharing can be the difference between safety and disaster.Also read: Taylor Swift reportedly has a clear vision for her future, but is Travis Kelce on the same page?","Taylor swift's name came up in a senate intelligence committee discussion on national security.

A Clear Target

Green Light from the President

Deterrence, Not Delay

Late Friday, a senior Houthi military official believed to be the group’s top missile commander was killed in a US airstrike in Sana’a, Yemen. The strike, confirmed by multiple US officials in internal communications, came after the individual was positively identified entering a residential building reportedly linked to his girlfriend.At 5:13 p.m. ET, Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL) wrote: “The first target—their top missile guy—was positively ID’d walking into his girlfriend's building. It’s now collapsed.”The strike was part of a broader US military operation initiated Friday afternoon following a directive from President Trump to restore freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and respond to Houthi aggression against commercial shipping.According to a strike timeline distributed by Department of Defense adviser Pete Hegseth , the first F-18s launched at 12:15 pm, followed by armed drones at 1:45 pm, and precision strikes beginning at 2:15 pm. A second wave of F-18s launched at 2:10 pm, with Tomahawk missiles firing by 3:36 pm.Also read: Atlantic releases full leaked Signal chat of Trump officials sharing strike details. Check complete text Officials had tracked the Houthi commander’s movements for some time. The strike was triggered once he entered the building.“VP, building collapsed. Had multiple positive IDs,” Waltz wrote to the team at 5:10 pm.Vice President JD Vance responded: “What?”Waltz clarified: “Typing too fast. The first target—their top missile guy—was positively ID’d walking into his girlfriend’s building. It’s now collapsed.”“Excellent,” Vance replied at 5:14 pm.The identity of the target has not been released publicly, but officials described him as a central figure in coordinating the Houthis’ missile and drone campaign that has disrupted shipping in the Red Sea for months.The strike came just hours after coordination among the White House, Pentagon, State Department, intelligence agencies, and senior lawmakers. Earlier that morning, Waltz had informed the group that the President’s guidance had been delivered:“Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the President’s guidance this morning in your high-side inboxes,” he wrote at 8:05 a.m.The White House also tasked the State Department and Department of Defense with drafting regional notification lists for allies. The Joint Staff provided a “specific sequence of events” for the day’s operations, according to Waltz.Though there was internal debate earlier in the week about the timing, consensus quickly formed by Friday.Vice President Vance had cautioned against acting without clearer public messaging and more time to prepare.“There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary,” he wrote Thursday.“I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. However, there is a strong argument for delaying this by a month.”DoD adviser Pete Hegseth disagreed: “We are prepared to execute, and if I had the final go/no-go vote, I believe we should. This is not about the Houthis; I see it as: Restoring freedom of navigation—a core national interest. Reestablishing deterrence, which Biden cratered.”Vance ultimately supported the operation, writing Friday morning: “If you think we should do it, let’s go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.”Hegseth emphasized the risks of waiting.“Two immediate risks of waiting:This leaks, and we look indecisive.Israel takes an action first—or the Gaza ceasefire falls apart—and we don’t get to start this on our own terms.”He added that messaging would be critical.“Nobody knows who the Houthis are—which is why we must stay focused on: Biden failed. Iran funded.”Following confirmation of the successful strike, officials praised the intelligence and operations teams involved.“The team in MAL did a great job as well,” Waltz noted. “CENTCOM was on point. Great job all,” Hegseth added. “More strikes ongoing tonight; full initial report tomorrow.”Senior Trump adviser Susie Wiles also weighed in: “Kudos to all—most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.” Strikes continued into the night, with additional targets expected to be hit over the weekend. According to officials, the operation remains in its early phases, with further briefings planned for the President, Vice President, and senior staff. The Pentagon and White House have not yet issued a public statement.","A senior houthi military official believed to be the group’s top missile commander was killed in a us airstrike in sana’a, yemen.

The Atlantic has published the full text of a Signal group chat among senior Trump administration national security officials, revealing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared precise details of military operations against Yemen’s Houthis. The chat logs indicate that Hegseth provided exact times of warplane launches , strike packages, and targets before the aircraft were airborne.The release follows intense scrutiny over how information that officials say should have been classified ended up in an unclassified group chat, which included The Atlantic’s Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg. Hegseth, currently traveling in the Indo-Pacific, has dismissed questions about the controversy, insisting he did not disclose war plans. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe told the Senate Intelligence Committee that it was Hegseth’s decision to determine whether the information was classified.Vice President JD Vance and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt have both lashed out at the publication, once again calling the claims a 'hoax'.Leavitt dismissed the incident as a ""hoax"" perpetrated by a known Trump critic, asserting that the messages did not contain classified ""war plans.""Goldberg reportedly sought the White House’s stance before publishing the chat logs and was told they would prefer he did not release them.The leak has sparked sharp reactions. Senator Jon Ossoff called it an “embarrassment,” arguing that sensitive military details should not be casually discussed in a group chat. Democratic lawmakers have criticised the administration for its handling of classified information, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton posted on social media, ""You have got to be kidding me,"" referencing Trump’s past attacks on her email use.Trump has downplayed the incident, describing it as ""the only glitch in two months"" and stating it was ""not a serious one."" He also defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who reportedly added Goldberg to the chat by mistake. Waltz acknowledged the error on Fox News, saying, ""We made a mistake. We're moving forward,"" and took full responsibility.Despite Democratic criticism, administration officials insist no classified information was shared. Ratcliffe and Gabbard testified that the messages did not include classified material, though The Atlantic reported they contained details on weapons, targets, and timing. When pressed on whether such information should have been classified, Gabbard deferred to the Defense Secretary.Team—establishing a principals group for coordination on Houthis, particularly over the next 72 hours. My deputy, Alex Wong, is pulling together a tiger team at the deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.Please provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple of days and over the weekend.Mike Needham for State.Andy Baker for VP.Joe Kent for DNI.Dan Katz for Treasury.Dan Caldwell for DoD.Brian McCormack for NSC.Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the President’s guidance this morning in your high-side inboxes.State and DoD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional allies and partners.Joint Staff is sending a more specific sequence of events this morning for the coming days, and we will work with DoD to ensure COS, OVP, and POTUS are briefed.Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan, but I think we are making a mistake.Three percent of US trade runs through the Suez. Forty percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message. But I am not sure the President is aware of how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.There’s also a risk of a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. However, there is a strong argument for delaying this by a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.There is nothing time-sensitive driving the timeline. We'll have the exact same options in a month. The Israelis will likely take strikes & therefore ask us for more support to replenish whatever they use against the Houthis. But that's a minor factor.I will send you the unclassified data we pulled on BAM shipping.From the CIA perspective, we are mobilizing assets to support now, but a delay would not negatively impact us. Additional time would allow us to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.VP, I understand your concerns—and fully support you raising them with POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to predict (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc.). Messaging is going to be tough no matter what—nobody knows who the Houthis are—which is why we must stay focused on:Biden failed. Iran funded.Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus.Two immediate risks of waiting: this leaks, and we look indecisive. Israel takes an action first—or the Gaza ceasefire falls apart—and we don’t get to start this on our own terms.We are prepared to execute, and if I had the final go/no-go vote, I believe we should. This is not about the Houthis; I see it as restoring freedom of navigation—a core national interest—and reestablishing deterrence, which Biden cratered.That said, we can easily pause. If we do, I will do all I can to enforce 100% OPSEC. I welcome other thoughts.The trade figures we have are: 15% of global trade, 30% of container trade. It’s difficult to break this down specifically to US trade because much of the container cargo is either going through the Red Sea or around the Cape of Good Hope before becoming manufactured goods for transatlantic trade with the United States.Whether we proceed today or not, European navies do not have the capability to defend against the sophisticated anti-ship cruise missiles and drones the Houthis are now using. At some point, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes.Per the President’s request, we are working with DoD and State to determine the associated costs and how to levy them on the Europeans.Pete, if you think we should do it, let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again. Let's make sure our messaging is tight. If there are things we can do upfront to minimize risk to Saudi oil facilities, we should do it.VP, I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.But Mike is correct—we are the only ones on the planet (on our side) who can do this. Nobody else is even close.The question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS’s directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go, but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.As I heard it, the President was clear: green light, but we must soon make it clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return.We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. If Europe doesn’t remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost, there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.TEAM UPDATE:12:15 PM: F-18s launch (1st strike package). 1:45 PM: ""Trigger-based"" F-18 1st strike window starts (target terrorist at known location). Strike drones (MQ-9s) launch. 2:10 PM: More F-18s launch (2nd strike package). 2:15 PM: Strike drones on target (first bombs expected). 3:36 PM: F-18 2nd strike starts; first sea-based Tomahawks launched.I will say a prayer for victory.VP, building collapsed. Had multiple positive IDs. Pete, Kurilla, the IC—amazing job.What?Typing too fast. The first target—their top missile guy—was positively ID’d walking into his girlfriend's building. It’s now collapsed.Excellent.Good job, Pete and your team!The team in MAL did a great job as well.CENTCOM was on point. Great job all.

Elon Musk Tesla Latest News: Tesla investor who called for Elon Musk's exit says Board should not have allowed him to purchase Twitter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-investor-who-called-for-elon-musks-exit-says-board-should-not-have-allowed-him-to-purchase-twitter/articleshow/119351660.cms,"Some Tesla investors want Elon Musk to step down from the CEO post.

Can Elon Musk be removed as CEO?

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who called for Elon Musk 's exit from the company has now said that the Tesla Board should have never let him purchase Twitter as that started Elon Musk's distraction from Tesla. ""Why has the board of directors sat quietly while so much brand value has been eroded to the point that cars are being set on fire?"" he said. ""It's been wildly negligent that the board has done nothing to curb Elon's behavior, especially around extremist statements.""Gerber's statement came as shares of Tesla dropped in the wake of massive protests against Elon Musk inside the country and also outside. Hundreds of Tesla vehicles have been set on fire showing anger against Elon's interference in the government decisions. The arson incidents are being treated as 'domestic terrorism' by the Donald Trump administration who sympathized with Elon at this time of crisis.Elon, however, brushed aside the emergency and adviced shareholders to hold on to their shares -- in a surprised all-hands meeting of Tesla.Gerber said the Tesla Board can't do anything against Musk as it solely functions for the benefit of Elon and is highly compensated by him. ""They're not going to do anything he doesn't say,"" Gerber said.Newsweek reported that Tesla shareholders don't have the power to directly vote to remove the CEO. But they could influence the Board if they believe Musk's leadership endangers their investment. ""An ouster would likely occur if enough board members—facing pressure from large investors—determined that Musk's actions or controversies significantly harmed Tesla's performance or reputation,"" David Park, professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University, told Newsweek.Gerber believes Tesla is suffering because of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- the department that he has been leading solely after Vivek Ramaswamy's exit. DOGE has a mandate to cut the government spending within a year and after that DOGE is supposed to stop functioning.As the world's wealthiest individual, Musk has assumed a prominent position in President Donald Trump's second term, heading DOGE. However, his engagement in politics has sparked investor unease, leading to Tesla's poor market performance throughout 2025.In 2025, Tesla's share value has declined by 37 per cent, following Musk's controversial political statements and decisions. Recent weeks have also witnessed increasing incidents of Tesla vehicles being targeted for vandalism including gunshots fired at Tesla dealerships, or targeted in arson attacks.Read more: Tesla arson attacks investigated as 'domestic terrorism,' backed by radical group tied to 2020 riots",Long-time tesla investor ross gerber has called for elon musk's exit from the company.

'Broke down beyond repair': Prince Harry quits his own charity in shocking boardroom war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/broke-down-beyond-repair-prince-harry-quits-his-own-charity-in-shocking-boardroom-war/articleshow/119547165.cms,"Prince Harry quits his own charity in shocking boardroom war (Pic credit: AP)

Britain's Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has stepped down as patron of Sentebale, the charity he co-founded nearly two decades ago, citing a ""devastating"" breakdown in relations within the organisation. The decision, announced late Tuesday, marks another setback for the Duke of Sussex, who has been living in self-imposed exile since stepping back from royal duties in 2020.Harry and his co-founder, Lesotho's Prince Seeiso, confirmed their resignations in a joint statement, attributing their departure to an irreparable rift between the charity's board of trustees and chair Sophie Chandauka, who was appointed in 2023.""With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,"" their statement read. ""It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.""Sentebale, established in 2006 in honor of Princess Diana, was created to support young people affected by HIV and AIDS in Lesotho and later expanded to Botswana. Harry had previously pledged to remain committed to the charity even after his departure from the British royal family, telling supporters in 2020, ""We're not walking away, and we certainly aren't walking away from you.""However, tensions within the organisation escalated as trustees reportedly requested Chandauka's resignation, leading to an internal dispute. Chandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, alleged she had been targeted after raising concerns about governance issues within the charity, including claims of harassment, misogyny, and racism.In a statement, Chandauka described the situation as ""the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the coverup that ensued.""She also confirmed that she had reported trustees to the UK's Charity Commission and taken legal action in the High Court in London. Sentebale, in response, said it had not yet received Harry and Seeiso's resignations but acknowledged an ongoing ""recalibration of the board.""The UK's Charity Commission confirmed it was ""aware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale"" and was assessing the situation to determine appropriate steps.In December, the charity announced plans to transition into a ""locally led organisation"" with a stronger focus on youth health, economic stability, and climate resilience in Southern Africa. As part of this shift, Sentebale relocated its leadership positions from London to Johannesburg.Harry and Seeiso claimed Chandauka had ""sued the charity"" in an effort to retain her position after trustees requested her resignation. They also signaled their intent to share their concerns with the Charity Commission.For Harry, the resignation is significant, as Sentebale was one of the few private patronages he retained after being stripped of his royal and military titles in 2020.
