India plans to set up nuclear submarine base in Andhra Pradesh next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-set-up-nuclear-submarine-base-in-andhra-pradesh-next-year/articleshow/120046893.cms,"Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 warships

NEW DELHI: India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal Andhra Pradesh next year, with an eye on China's ever-expanding naval forays into the Indian Ocean Region. India is also progressively upgrading the Karwar base in Karnataka on the western seaboard.The strategic base located near the small coastal village of Rambilli, about 50km south from the Eastern Naval Command headquarters at Visakhapatnam on the eastern seaboard, has underground pens and a network of tunnels to house nuclear submarines.This will enable the submarines to quietly slip into the Bay of Bengal without detection from spy satellites and quickly head towards the critical Malacca Strait and beyond on deterrent patrols.""The first phase of the Rambilli base under Project Varsha is almost complete. After commissioning in 2026, it can be expanded and upgraded in phases, much like what is under way at the Karwar base under Project Seabird,"" a source said.It has taken well over a decade for the construction of the nuclear submarine base to reach this stage after overcoming major technological, environmental and other challenges.The source said, ""The inner harbour is ready. Work on the outer harbour, with the requisite breakwaters and jetties, is in progress."" Concurrently, India this year will also commission its third nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), INS Aridhaman , with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, to add more teeth to the underwater leg of the country's nuclear triad.Slightly bigger than the first two operational SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, INS Aridhaman will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500km.While a fourth submarine is also under construction under the secretive over ₹90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier. In Oct last year, the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security also approved the construction of two 9,800-tonne nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) for ₹40,000 crore.The eventual plan is for six SSNs, which are armed with non-nuclear missiles and other weapons for conventional warfare. On the West coast, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday inaugurated additional operational, repair and logistic facilities worth over 2,000 crore under Project Seabird at the Karwar naval base, which provides the Navy with both strategic depth and operational flexibility, especially against Pakistan.Already the home base for over a dozen frontline warships, the completion of the ongoing Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 major warships and submarines as well as 23 yard-craft. A dual-use naval air station, a full-fledged naval dockyard, four covered dry berths and logistics for ships and aircraft are also part of this phase of construction.After Phase-IIB, currently in the planning stage, the Karwar base spread over a 25-km expanse will be capable of basing 50 warships and submarines as well as 40 auxiliary craft, which will also go a long way in decongesting the Mumbai harbour.","India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal andhra pradesh next year.

CNBC host Jim Cramer predicted a 1987-like ' Black Monday ' coming week because of the tariffs Donald Trump imposed on countries. ""If the president doesn't try to reach out and reward these countries and companies that play by the rules, then the 1987 scenario...the one where we went down three days and then down 22% on Monday, has the most cogency.

Pressure and threats are not the correct ways to engage with China,” the foreign ministry said in a lengthy statement today.Trump maintained his stance on tariffs and urged Americans to ""hang tough"" as the tariffs are not going to be easy. China and “many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said, accusing them of using the United States as a “whipping post,” reiterating his rationale for the tariffs as he has accused other countries of “taking advantage” of the United States.","The market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on thursday and friday after trump's tariff announcement on wednesday.

Poll Do you think green card holders should reconsider traveling abroad in light of recent immigration policies? No, I believe it's safe. Yes, it's too risky.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel.

Players responded with cheers to Wayne Gretzky’s speech

During the 4 Nations Face-Off final in February 2025, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky gave a heartfelt locker room speech to Team Canada. His wife, Janet Gretzky, shared a video on Instagram showing Wayne shaking hands with team captain Sidney Crosby before addressing the players.In the speech, Wayne Gretzky announced the starting lineup and fired up the team with words about pride, teamwork, and representing their country. The moment sparked loud cheers from the players, showing how much his presence meant.""First of all, congratulations. You made the hockey world proud, ex-players, and of course the country, so good for you guys. It's been fun to watch,"" Gretzky said. ""I know you give up a lot of time to do these kinds of things, but nothing is more fun than playing for the country. So I wish you guys good luck tonight.”Canada went on to win the final in dramatic fashion—beating the USA 3-2 in overtime, with Connor McDavid scoring the winning goal. After the game, Gretzky gave each player a red “Be Great” cap as a personal gesture of encouragement.Though many fans celebrated his role, some criticized him for not wearing a Team Canada jersey and being too friendly with the American team. These reactions were fueled by his past ties with former U.S. President Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s tariffs and remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state have strained U.S.-Canada relations. This week, NHL legend Dominik Hasek criticized Wayne Gretzky’s perceived closeness to Trump, questioning his loyalty to Canada in light of recent events.“It is not surprising to me that Canadian people are asking about the attitude of a man who is a Canadian icon. To be honest, I am also interested in his attitude. He must know best why he does not express himself on this.

US markets plunge



Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk lost a combined $42.6 billion in a single day after US President Donald Trump announced a fresh wave of tariffs that shook global markets. According to data from Forbes, Facebook-parent Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg suffered the biggest loss, with his wealth dropping by $17.9 billion on Thursday, April 3. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos followed with a $16 billion decline, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his net worth fall by $8.7 billion.The losses came after President Trump introduced a new set of “discounted” reciprocal tariffs, which triggered panic on Wall Street. The announcement led to one of the worst trading days in recent years, with all major US stock indexes recording their biggest single-day drops since the COVID-19 pandemic. The sharp selloff reflects growing investor concern over the impact of tariffs on business costs, global trade, and tech sector performance.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth dropped by $7.4 billion, while Microsoft founder Bill Gates saw a one-day loss of $774 million.Alphabet co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lost $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also faced a decline, with his wealth falling by $18 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook saw his net worth decrease by $68 million during the market selloff.Wall Street hit its lowest since 2022. Overnight, the US markets took a steep hit following the announcement of new tariffs. The S&P 500 dropped 275.05 points, or 4.85 per cent, closing at 5,395.92. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1,053.60 points, or 5.99 per cent, to 16,547.45, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1,682.61 points, or 3.98 per cent, finishing at 40,542.71.Analysts at UBS said that legal challenges could arise soon against the White House’s use of executive authority to impose the tariffs. Trump announced the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—a law that has not been used before for such broad changes in economic policy.""Furthermore, businesses are likely to intensify lobbying efforts. And political pressure to ease tariffs could mount as economic costs rise,"" UBS said in a note.""In our base case (to which we assign a 50 per cent probability), we would expect tariffs to be reduced from the levels announced by the President.

Did The Simpsons predict Donald Trump’s death? The truth behind the viral video

Viral Trump coffin scene from The Simpsons is AI-generated, not real

Similar incidents in the past

Why these fake predictions gain traction

Official response and fact-checking

In the digital age, viral videos and AI-generated content can blur the lines between fact and fiction. One of the latest topics gaining traction online involves a claim that the popular animated show The Simpsons predicted the death of former U.S. President Donald Trump on April 12, 2025. The video, shared across social media platforms, shows what appears to be a scene from the show depicting a Trump-like figure in a coffin surrounded by mourners—prompting many to speculate whether The Simpsons has once again made an eerily accurate prophecy.The popularity of The Simpsons and its history of making surprisingly accurate predictions—such as Donald Trump's presidency or the invention of smartwatches—have fueled the intrigue. However, as with many viral claims, it's important to examine the facts behind the video, verify its source, and understand whether there is any truth to the speculation.The video making the rounds claims to be a scene from The Simpsons showing a Donald Trump-like character lying in a coffin. The setting is somber, with political figures surrounding the casket, and the voiceover suggests that this represents Trump’s death on April 12, 2025. The timestamp and content are intended to reinforce the idea that the show predicted his death years in advance.Adding to the credibility for some viewers is The Simpsons’ reputation for making correct predictions about real-world events. However, this particular clip is not what it appears to be.According to Matt Selman, executive producer of The Simpsons, the specific scene shown in the viral clip never appeared in any episode of the series. In fact, there is no The Simpsons episode, old or recent, that features Donald Trump’s death or anything resembling the visuals used in the video.The image and footage in question have been confirmed to be photoshopped or AI-generated. In some versions, the words “R.I.P Donald Trump 1946–2024” appear, a telltale sign of digital manipulation. These visuals have been widely circulated on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and YouTube Shorts, often accompanied by sensational music and misleading captions designed to provoke emotional reactions and maximize engagement.This isn’t the first time fake content involving The Simpsons and Donald Trump has gone viral. Since at least 2017, manipulated clips and images have circulated purporting that the show foresaw Trump’s death. Many of these posts resurface following real-world events involving the former president.For instance, a similar fake image went viral following an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024, falsely claiming that The Simpsons had shown his death in a previous season. Like the latest viral video, that image was also debunked by fact-checkers and producers associated with the show.The Simpsons has gained notoriety for seemingly accurate predictions, including Trump’s presidency (Season 11, Episode 17: ""Bart to the Future""), the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, and the invention of devices resembling modern smartwatches. These accurate predictions have contributed to a belief among some viewers that the series is prophetic.However, the vast majority of these coincidences are either exaggerated, misunderstood, or—like the Trump death scene—fabricated. The show's vast number of episodes and its satirical nature naturally lead to scenarios that may eventually resemble real-world events. But that does not validate manipulated images or support predictions not backed by actual episodes.There has been no official confirmation from Fox or the creators of The Simpsons supporting the authenticity of the viral clip. Executive producer Matt Selman’s statements clearly refute any suggestion that such a scene exists in the show’s extensive catalogue. Independent fact-checking organizations have also debunked the claim, confirming that the video is digitally altered and not taken from any legitimate The Simpsons content.","A viral video claims to show a scene from the simpsons showing a donald trump-like character lying in a coffin.

Are Trump's reciprocal tariffs bad for China? DeepSeek says...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/are-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-bad-for-china-deepseek-says-/articleshow/119981002.cms,"DeepSeek

DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’

China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system, and promoting the construction of an open world economy. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade, safeguard the interests of the nation and its people, and promote the healthy and stable development of the economy. China's development achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. No external factors can hinder China's progress and the improvement of its people's lives. China will continue to deepen reforms, expand openness, and work with other countries around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

DeepSeek’s reply to “retaliatory actions that China can take against Trump's tariffs?""

China has a range of policy tools and strategic options to respond to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., ensuring the protection of its national interests while maintaining stability in global trade. Possible measures include:

1. Reciprocal Tariffs on U.S. Goods

•⁠ ⁠China could impose *targeted tariffs* on key U.S. exports such as *agricultural products (soybeans, pork), aircraft, automobiles, and energy products*.

•⁠ ⁠This would pressure politically sensitive U.S. industries, influencing domestic sentiment in key electoral states.

2. Export Controls on Critical Materials

•⁠ ⁠China dominates global supply chains in *rare earth metals* (used in electronics, defense, and green tech).

•⁠ ⁠Restrictions on rare earth exports could disrupt U.S. manufacturing, similar to measures taken in past trade disputes.

3. Non-Tariff Barriers & Regulatory Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Stricter inspections* on U.S. imports (food safety, customs delays).

•⁠ ⁠*Anti-dumping & anti-subsidy investigations* against U.S. products.

•⁠ ⁠*Preferential treatment* for non-U.S. companies in government procurement.

4. Diversifying Trade Partners (Reducing U.S. Dependence)

•⁠ ⁠*Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America* through new agreements.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)* to deepen Asia-Pacific trade ties.

5. Currency & Financial Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Allowing the yuan to depreciate* to make Chinese exports more competitive.

•⁠ ⁠*Dumping U.S. Treasury bonds* (though this is a double-edged sword).

6. Legal & WTO Challenges

•⁠ ⁠*Filing complaints at the WTO* against U.S. tariffs, as done in previous trade wars.

•⁠ ⁠*Forming alliances with other affected countries* to jointly oppose U.S. protectionism.

7. Domestic Stimulus & Self-Reliance

•⁠ ⁠*Boosting domestic consumption* to offset export losses.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating tech independence* (e.g., semiconductor self-sufficiency via policies like ""Made in China 2025"").

Conclusion

China has a *strategic, multi-layered approach* to counter U.S. tariffs, combining retaliatory measures with long-term economic resilience strategies. The goal is not just short-term retaliation but also reducing dependency on the U.S. market while strengthening global alliances.

US President Donald Trump ’s recent tariff announcements have reignited concerns about a potential trade war, particularly with China. The new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on Chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors, with technology supply chains facing significant impact. The Trump administration justifies the tariffs as a means to safeguard American industries and rectify trade imbalances, but critics express concerns about rising consumer prices and global economic instability.We asked DeepSeek , China's biggest AI disrupter in recent times, about the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on the country, and the response was pretty neutral.When asked, “Are Tump’s reciprocal tariffs bad for China?”, DeepSeek highlighted a “mutually beneficial strategy”.On the question, “What China can do to reciprocate the reciprocal Tariffs announced by Donald Trump?”, DeepSeek replied highlighting that China possesses a diverse toolkit to counteract US tariffs, encompassing both retaliatory actions and long-term strategic adjustments aimed at protecting China's national interests and maintain global trade stability.It explained the response in 7 points. Here’s what DeepSeek said:Last year, China announced a ban on the export of key minerals to the US, a move that could significantly impact the US technology manufacturing sector. According to a Reuters report, China's export ban includes minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others.These minerals are essential components in a wide range of technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications (e.g., ammunition, nuclear weapons). Gallium and germanium are crucial for semiconductors, while germanium also plays a role in infrared technology, fiber optic cables, and solar cells.","Deepseek says ‘no external factors can hinder china's progress’ the new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors.

His aides, meanwhile, attempted to calm investor fears, noting that over 50 countries had expressed interest in opening talks to remove the tariffs.Trump said the US has a ""massive financial deficit with China, the European Union and many others"", accusing predecessor Biden of growing surplus.""We have massive Financial Deficits with China, the European Union, and many others. The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing Tens of Billions of Dollars into the U.S.A. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,"" he said on his social media platform TruthSocial.He further said: ""The Surplus with these Countries has grown during “Presidency” of Sleepy Joe Biden. We are going to reverse it, and reverse it QUICKLY. Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!""On April 02, Trump implemented a series of extensive tariffs aimed at restructuring US trade relationships and bolstering domestic industries. On April 2, dubbed ""Liberation Day,"" a universal 10% import duty was imposed on all goods entering the United States, with higher rates for 57 specific trading partners, including China, Canada, and Mexico. These increased tariffs were calculated based on existing trade deficits with each country, with the administration aiming to reduce these deficits to zero.Specifically, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to an effective rate of 54% after April 9, intensifying the ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. Additionally, a 25% tariff on imported automobiles was enacted on April 3, affecting major auto-exporting countries.The administration justified these measures by citing the need to address trade imbalances, protect national security, and curb issues such as contraband drug trafficking. However, these actions have led to significant economic debates.Critics argue that the tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices , potential job losses in industries reliant on imports, and strained relationships with key trading partners. Some economists warn of the risk of a recession due to reduced consumer confidence and increased production costs.In response, countries like Canada, China, and the European Union have announced counter-tariffs , further escalating global trade tensions. Legal challenges are also emerging, questioning the extent of executive power in imposing such tariffs and their alignment with international trade laws .As these policies unfold, their long-term impact on the US economy and global trade dynamics remains a subject of close observation and analysis.","Us president donald trump defends tariffs, calling it an 'economic revolution' trump said the us has a ""massive financial deficit with china, the european union and many others"" his remarks followed a steep downturn in global financial markets, which seemed poised to extend their losses when trading reopened.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120051339,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1098856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that a deal over the future of TikTok in the United States was nearly finalised but China pulled back in response to new American tariffs.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said Beijing's change of stance came after Washington slapped an additional 34 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports last week.""The report is that we had a deal, pretty much for TikTok, not a deal, but pretty close, and then China changed the deal because of tariffs.

Trump defends tariffs, takes questions from reporters aboard Air Force One

US President Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from around the world, saying he would not back off unless trade imbalances with the US were addressed.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump acknowledged the economic uncertainty caused by the tariffs but said the move was necessary for long-term stability.When asked, ""Is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate?""""I think your question is so stupid,"" Trump reacted fiercely to the reporter's question.""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something and we have been treated so badly by other countries,"" Trump said, referring to the sharp market downturn triggered by his trade moves.The president's comments came as global markets braced for further volatility, with US stock futures plunging Sunday evening; Dow and S&P 500 futures dropped nearly 4 per cent, while Nasdaq futures fell nearly 5 per cent. Bitcoin also declined about 6 per cent.Despite rising fears of a recession, Trump showed no signs of backing down.

""There doesn't have to be a recession,"" Bessent said. ""What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.""Trump also took to social media to rally support, posting, ""WE WILL WIN.

NEW DELHI: Asian stock markets nosedived on Monday as global financial turmoil deepened, triggered by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures. With fears of a full-blown trade war mounting, US futures pointed to further losses on Wall Street, compounding Friday’s historic meltdown.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%, while Taiwan’s benchmark index slumped close to 10%. South Korea’s Kospi lost 5.5%, Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 6.3%, and Singapore tumbled 8.5%, signalling widespread panic across Asia. The ASX 200 also hit its lowest level in almost 15 months.The sharp sell-off followed Wall Street’s worst single-day performance since the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 5.5%, and the Nasdaq slid 5.8%, erasing trillions in market value.Analysts estimate that over $9 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets in just two days, drawing comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. Investor confidence has evaporated following China’s decision to impose a 34% tariff on all US imports beginning April 10, intensifying fears of prolonged economic disruption .Meanwhile, US crude dipped below $60 per barrel for the first time since April 2021, and the dollar weakened to 145.98 yen, indicating a rush towards traditional safe-haven assets.Despite the mounting turmoil, Donald Trump remained unapologetic and said, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” denying he was deliberately fuelling a market collapse. Speaking aboard Air Force One, he insisted countries were eager to negotiate: “They’re dying to make a deal.”The latest wave of chaos was set off after Beijing retaliated Friday, matching Trump's tariffs with its own 34% levy on all US imports starting April 10. China’s Commerce Ministry called it a direct response to the US's aggressive trade measures.Senior officials in Washington struck a defiant tone even as they confirmed outreach from dozens of countries. “More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation,” said Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, noting that Vietnam had already requested a 45-day delay on tariffs.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added, “At this moment he’s created maximum leverage for himself... I think we’re going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it’s believable.”Jerome Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve, warned the trade war could lead to “higher inflation and lower growth,” signalling limited room for interest rate cuts. Trump, however, fired back: “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country was hit with 17% tariffs, was due in Washington Monday for emergency talks. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in an op-ed, warned that “the world as we knew it has gone,” and that future stability would depend on “deals and alliances.”Markets in Saudi Arabia, which remained open on Sunday, were also battered—plunging 6.78%, the worst daily loss since the pandemic. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government was bracing for more turmoil. “You can’t change global events. What you can do is prepare for them,” he said.Economists have warned that tariffs could trigger price hikes at home, a charge the Trump administration denies. “I don’t think that you’re going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,” Hassett insisted.Larry Summers, former economic adviser to President Obama, said, “There is a very good chance there’s going to be more turbulence in markets the way we saw on Thursday and Friday.”Yet Trump struck an optimistic note. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH,” he wrote on social media. He later added: “Some day people will realize that Tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”Wall Street, however, painted a bleaker picture. Companies deeply connected with China suffered severe losses—DuPont plunged 12.7% after Chinese regulators launched an anti-trust investigation, and GE Healthcare fell 16%, as 12% of its revenue comes from China.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve faces a dilemma: rate cuts could cushion economic damage, but may also stoke inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned, “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored... [and ensure] a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”","Tokyo's nikkei 225 fell 7.1% in early trade after briefly plunging nearly 8%.

An unexpected consequence? Penguin memes .Images of the flightless birds have waddled their way across the internet this week after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Heard Island and McDonald Islands , Australian territories near Antarctica that are home to many penguins but no people.One meme featured an altered photo of the explosive February White House meeting in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly clashed with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Instead of a fiery confrontation with the wartime leader, however, Trump and Vance sit next to a black-and-white bird.One person who posted the meme wrote, ""Maybe it didn't say thank you?"" in a possible reference to Vance's accusation that Zelenskyy had not appropriately thanked the United States for the military support Washington had provided Ukraine throughout the war.A different meme showed a penguin teaching sea gulls to aim their waste at Teslas, an apparent nod to Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk. Yet another showed a huge gathering of penguins with a caption citing ""Unprecedented protests"" on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, ""as the population rises up"" against Trump's imposition of across-the-board tariffs.The UNESCO World Heritage Convention notes the islands' ""complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact."" Still, Trump included the desolate islands on his list, imposing the 10% baseline tariff he placed on nearly all goods imported into the United States.The Wednesday announcement, which Trump described as America's ""Liberation Day,"" sent shock waves across the world as both allies and adversaries scrambled to make sense of the new and hefty tariffs. The move has shot U.S. import duties to the highest levels in more than a century.Also slotted for new tariffs were the British Indian Ocean Territory, a collection of mostly uninhabited islands, save for U.S. and British soldiers stationed on joint military bases.Other islands subjected to tariffs included Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand that has fewer than 2,000 inhabitants; the Norwegian islands of Svalbard, which has about 3,000 residents; and Jan Mayen, where the only humans are the military personnel who operate a weather and coastal services station.Trump has said little about the methodology behind the new system of calculations, but each country's new tariff rate appeared to come from a formula that takes the trade deficit America runs with a nation and divides it by the exports that country sent into the United States. The White House explained its methodology in this post, which essentially confirms that formula.Then, because Trump said he was being ""kind,"" the final tariff number was cut in half.It is not clear how the administration decided to add Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the list of tariffs. The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment.","Penguin memes flood the internet after u.s. imposed tariffs on australian islands.

A 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot and killed by Israeli forces during an incident in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, with Israeli authorities claiming he was among a group of “terrorists” hurling rocks at cars on a nearby highway.According to the town’s mayor, Adeeb Lafi, the teenager, Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee , was shot at the town’s entrance along with two other teens.Mayor Lafi told Reuters the Israeli army later declared Omar dead after detaining him.As per AFP, the Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed its teams transported the teenager’s body to hospital and reported that two other boys were also wounded, one in the abdomen and the other in the thigh. Both were 14 years old, and one of them, Ayoub Asaad, also holds US citizenship, his father told AFP.The Israeli military issued a statement saying soldiers opened fire after spotting “three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.” It said one of the suspects was “eliminated” and two others were wounded.However, the Palestinian foreign ministry strongly condemned the incident, describing it as an “extra-judicial killing” and accusing Israel of “continued impunity.” The ministry further criticised the use of live fire against children , saying Israel’s actions encouraged “further crimes.”Violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified since the Gaza war began on October 7, 2023.According to Palestinian health authorities, at least 918 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers since then, including militants. Meanwhile, Israeli sources say 33 Israelis, including soldiers, have died during raids and attacks in the same period.The town of Turmus Ayya, northeast of Ramallah, is known for its large community of dual Palestinian-American citizens. Witness accounts, such as that of Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, one of the injured teens, contradicted the Israeli military’s version.He told AFP he was collecting fruit when he was shot by a soldier.The father of Ayoub Asaad also claimed their ambulance was delayed at a checkpoint, and that a soldier told him he was the one who shot the three boys.Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and clashes between settlers, armed Palestinians, and Israeli forces have grown more frequent, especially since the escalation in Gaza.","A 14-year-old palestinian-american boy was shot and killed by israeli forces during an incident in the west bank town of turmus ayya on sunday.

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. US authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry, you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new update said. ""We have obtained the information on this page from the US authorities.

Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza | BBC News

Israel’s military has admitted its initial account of a deadly strike that killed 15 emergency workers in Gaza was ""mistaken"", following the emergence of video footage contradicting its claims.The killings occurred on March 23 near Rafah, in the Tel al-Sultan district of southern Gaza, during Israeli military operations.As per news agency Associated Press, the Israeli military initially said its troops opened fire because the convoy, comprising Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances, Civil Defence vehicles, and a UN car, was approaching “suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals.However, phone footage taken by one of the medics who was killed shows the vehicles clearly had flashing emergency lights and visible logos.The six-minute video, recovered from the pocket of a dead paramedic and verified by a surviving colleague, captures the convoy approaching an already hit ambulance. Gunfire erupts without warning, lasting over five minutes. “Forgive me, mother. This is the path I chose, mother, to help people,” the medic can be heard saying before the video ends.Eight Red Crescent staff, six Civil Defence workers, and one UN employee were killed. One medic, Assaad al-Nassasra, remains missing. A surviving paramedic, Munzer Abed, told AP he was beaten, stripped, and interrogated by Israeli soldiers who also shot at the incoming vehicles.According to the BBC, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) now acknowledges the convoy had lights on and says earlier reports were based on inaccurate field reports. It also admits the paramedics were unarmed but continues to allege that some were affiliated with Hamas.An Israeli military official claimed troops mistook the medics for militants because the convoy stopped near a car previously used by Hamas. The IDF also confirmed soldiers buried the bodies and vehicles the next day, saying it was to “clear the road” and “protect the bodies from wild animals.” UN personnel uncovered the site a week later.Jonathan Whittall from the UN’s humanitarian office (OCHA) in Gaza dismissed Israeli claims that the medics had militant ties, stating, “They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on. They were ready to save lives.”The Palestinian Red Crescent and several international organisations are now calling for an independent investigation. ""We don't trust any of the army investigations,"" said PRCS President Younes Al-Khatib at the UN.According to the UN, over 150 emergency responders and more than 1,000 health workers have been killed in Gaza since the conflict escalated in October 2023, when Hamas launched a cross-border attack that killed 1,200 Israelis. Israel’s military response has since claimed over 50,600 lives in Gaza, as per the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry.","Israeli army admits'mistake' in killing of 15 medics in gaza, organisations call for independent probe.

No, I oppose his view. Yes, I support his view.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump’s latest push for tariffs, even as he maintains that such protectionist measures are the wrong approach, according to The Times.In a speech due to be delivered on Sunday, the Labour leader is set to announce that he recognises why Trump's economic nationalism resonates with many voters. However, he will also argue that tariffs ultimately do more harm than good.“Trump has done something that we don’t agree with but there’s a reason why people are behind him on this,” a spokesperson for the Prime Minister told The Times.“The world has changed, globalization is over and we are now in a new era. We’ve got to demonstrate that our approach, a more active Labour government, a more reformist government, can provide the answers for people in every part of this country,” the spokesperson added, quoted by the New York Post.Starmer will also throw light on what he sees as the end of globalisation, saying that free trade and mass migration, once considered cornerstones of modern economic policy, have failed large sections of the voters.Although Starmer has not yet spoken to President Trump about the newly announced tariffs, he did raise the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron during a phone call on Saturday. Both leaders reportedly agreed that a trade war would benefit no one, though “nothing should be off the table,” according to the report.Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, announced on Wednesday, include a 10% levy on all goods imported from the UK, part of a broader strategy targeting almost every country in the world.","Uk prime minister keir starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind us president donald trump's latest push for tariffs.

Russian spy sensors are being deployed to track the UK’s nuclear submarines, a recent report by The Sunday Times revealed.The Royal Navy found some of the covert devices in waterways surrounding Britain, sparking fears that Moscow is secretly monitoring and potentially plotting sabotage against major parts of UK infrastructure, including the country’s four Vanguard-class submarines, which carry Britain’s nuclear missiles.Despite the discovery being flagged as major national security threat by military officials, it remained hidden from the public.“There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic,” a senior military source told The Sunday Times.“This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.”Officials suspect the operation to be a part of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s wider ""greyzone"" strategy, an undeclared form of warfare targeting undersea cables, pipelines, and other critical systems, the New York Post reported.In the last 15 months alone, 11 deep-sea communication cables in the Baltic Sea have been damaged, and similar covert surveillance equipment has reportedly washed up along Britain’s coastline.Military operatives have also detected unmanned Russian vehicles near seabed communication lines, which link the UK to the rest of the world. Of the 60 internet cables connected to Britain, some remain undisclosed to the public, according to senior sources.The ministry of defence gathered intelligence suggesting that superyachts owned by Russian oligarchs were used to conduct underwater probe, quietly gathering underwater data.“Our role is to both defeat any threats to the UK as well as take it out of the greyzone,” said captain Simon Pressdee.“We do the latter by understanding who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings who is involved and providing that evidence to avoid misunderstandings and make those who threaten the UK accountable for their actions.”Russian naval presence in UK waters isn’t new, and the government is now ramping up efforts to shield the country’s undersea infrastructure, seeking financial support from private tech and energy firms to help bolster defences.In the short term, a new project codenamed Cabot will be launched to safeguard vital underwater assets in partnership with industries that rely on them.However, some Royal Navy sources believe more aggressive steps should be implimented, including laying sea mines around sensitive areas, a strategy not used since the Cold War.A ministry of defence spokesperson said, “We are committed to enhancing the security of critical offshore infrastructure.”“Alongside our NATO and Joint Expeditionary Force allies, we are strengthening our response to ensure that Russian ships and aircraft cannot operate in secrecy near the UK or near NATO territory, harnessing new technologies like AI and coordinating patrols with our allies. And our continuous-at-sea nuclear deterrent continues to patrol the world’s oceans undetected as it has done for 56 years.”","Kremlin's 'greyzone' tactic is targeting undersea cables, pipelines, and other critical systems.
