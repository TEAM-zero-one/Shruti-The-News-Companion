India to begin testing new long-range interceptor missiles for defence shield next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-begin-testing-new-long-range-interceptor-missiles-for-defence-shield-next-year/articleshow/123536547.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under Project Kusha, which will be a critical element of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra (MSC)’ announced by PM Modi to provide security cover to strategic as well as vital civilian areas in the country by 2035.The plan is to test the M1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions, in 2026. It will be followed by M2 (250-km range) in 2027 and M3 (350-km range) in 2028 for the missile-based layered defence system being developed by DRDO, top sources told TOI.The aim is to complete the development of these three long-range surface-to-air missiles (LR-SAMs) and related systems under Project Kusha by 2028 to, hopefully, pave the way for their induction from 2030 onwards, the sources added.This fully-automated LR-SAM system, which will rival the expensive Russian-origin S-400 Triumf air defence system deployed by the IAF in limited numbers, will be a part of the overall MSC plan to build a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around key locations.In this, it will be somewhat similar to the proposed `Golden Dome’ missile defence initiative of the US or the deployed Israeli `Iron Dome’, which only has to protect a very small country.It is estimated the expansive Golden Dome, with the capability to also shoot down missiles in space, will cost around $500 billion over the next 20 years.Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, at the `Ran Samwad’ conclave at Mhow on Tuesday, said he was sure India could build its own “Iron or Golden Dome” under the MSC at “an affordable cost” with a whole-of-nation approach.“It will act both as a shield and sword,” the CDS said, in tune with the PM’s statement that the defence shield will not only thwart aerial threats but also launch counter-strikes to hit the adversary “many times more”.This clearly implies India will go in for a major expansion of its conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of missiles like Pralay (500-km strike range), BrahMos (increased range from 450-km to 800-km) and land-attack cruise missiles (1,000-km range).Gen Chauhan, on his part, acknowledged the proposed defence shield will require “a colossal amount of integration” of myriad capabilities as well as development of infrastructure and processes for “detection, acquisition and neutralisation of enemy air vectors, using soft and hard kill options, including kinetic and directed energy weapons (like lasers)”.The shield, of course, will require multi-domain ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) through an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors deployed on land, air, sea, undersea and space.Then, robust land and sea-based batteries of a wide array of short to long range SAM missiles, high-power lasers and other weapons will be needed. Finally, reliable command and control posts to manage the sensors and weapons with an integrated air picture to effectively respond in real-time.A small beginning was made with DRDO’s maiden test of an integrated air defence weapon system (IADWS) on Aug 23. It included quick reaction surface-to-air missiles (QRSAMS, with 30-km interception range), very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS, with 6-km range) missiles and a 30-kilowatt laser-based directed energy weapon (DEW, with 3.5-km range).“Many of the building blocks for the MSC defence shield have either been developed or are being developed. The real challenge will be to integrate them all. It will cost a lot of money for a large country like India,” a source said.A comprehensive defence shield will also include the operational deployment of Phase-I of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which has been developed by DRDO to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, DRDO also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","India will next year begin testing new interceptor missiles for an indigenous air and missile defence shield under project kusha. The plan is to test the m1 missile, with an interception range of 150-km against incoming enemy aircraft, stealth fighters, cruise missiles, drones and precision-guided munitions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123536546,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392171,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
US-China trade row: Donald Trump says he could ‘destroy China’; hints at 200% tariffs on rare earths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-china-trade-row-donald-trump-says-he-could-destroy-china-hints-at-200-tariffs-on-rare-earths/articleshow/123513438.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States holds overwhelming leverage over China, even suggesting that if he chose to use it, he could “destroy” the world’s second-largest economy.Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday before a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Trump insisted Washington’s position was stronger than Beijing’s in the ongoing trade dispute. “They have some cards. We have incredible cards,” he told reporters.“But I don’t want to play those cards. If I did, that would destroy China. I’m not going to play those cards.” The US president did not clarify whether he was referring to economic, political, or strategic tools, reported Fox News.Trump added that he had spoken recently with Chinese President Xi Jinping and was considering a trip to Beijing. “At some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we'll go to China,” he said, noting that Xi had extended an invitation.The remarks came as Washington and Beijing agreed on 12 August to prolong their trade truce for another 90 days to give negotiators more time to find common ground. Tariff battles have escalated over the past year, with Trump raising duties on Chinese goods several times.The highest duty peaked at 145% in April, while most Chinese imports are currently subject to a 30% tariff.China has responded with a 10% levy on US imports, according to Fox News.Adding to the strain, Trump singled out China’s rare earths policy, warning that unless Beijing supplied the US with magnets, “we have to charge them 200% tariff or something”, according to news agency Reuters.China tightened export restrictions on rare earth items in April as part of its retaliation.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has previously described China’s oil trade with sanctioned states as another sticking point. As per Fox News, he identified Beijing’s imports of Iranian and Russian oil during negotiations in Sweden, calling it a central dispute.Washington argues that revenue from such exports helps Tehran and Moscow fund destabilising activities.Bessent has also pushed for Beijing to reduce reliance on exports and open itself up as a stronger importer in global trade, while the US aims to limit China’s dominance as the world’s manufacturing hub.","Us president donald trump has claimed that the united states holds overwhelming leverage over china.

"PM Modi avoided four Donald Trump calls, says German media, as US-India ties sour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-avoided-four-donald-trump-calls-says-german-media-as-us-india-ties-sour/articleshow/123529092.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

It’s not PM Modi’s style to negotiate details over phone, says diplomat

Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to take four calls from US President Donald Trump in recent weeks amid a raging trade dispute, a German newspaper has reported, as ties between Washington and New Delhi have soured rapidly, testing what both sides repeatedly said was the most consequential relationship of the 21st century.The Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung did not cite the source of its claim, but opined that the trade clash between Trump and Modi illustrated that India will not bow to American pressure and New Delhi wants to manage its relations with both Washington and Beijing in its own way. A Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asia carried a similar report about Modi avoiding the US President's calls, ""heightening Trump's frustration. ""Officials in Washington declined to confirm or deny if the calls were made, but a key Indian diplomat said in a background conversation earlier this month that it is not PM Modi's style to negotiate details over the phone. Separately, another source said it is possible Modi ducked the call to be avoid the outcome of the conversation being misrepresented, something New Delhi suggests the US President has done on the India-Pakistan clash.Trump has claimed dozens of times over the past four months that he stopped a possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan by using trade, often throwing out random numbers about how close they were to it, how many jets were lost, and how many wars he prevented. In the latest riff on the subject, which many American analysts now characterize as a delusional attempt to cadge a Nobel Peace Prize, he said India and Pakistan were two weeks away from a nuclear war.The PM also declined Trump's impromptu invitation to visit Washington late June after the G-20 meeting in Canada -- when they did not meet in person as Trump left early. The US President ostensibly wanted Modi in the White House at the same time he had invited Pakistan's de facto military ruler Asim Munir for bragging rights that he had forged peace between them. India has expressed resentment about the false equivalence between a perpetrator of terrorism and a victim of terrorism, a difference that appears lost on a White House in thrall of business opportunities.Seasoned US analysts, even former officials who are not particularly well inclined towards New Delhi, suggest that Trump's personal pique, more than policy issues, is driving ties off the cliff, and are warning that his hostility towards India will drive it closer to the China and Russia.Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who has fallen foul of the US President, said India too feels ""deeply aggrieved"" by Trump because it is the only victim of his threat to impose tariffs and sanctions, even as Russia and China remain largely untouched. ""The longer India hangs out to dry, the worse the New Delhi-Washington relationship gets,"" Bolton wrote, hours after he was subjected to an FBI raid in what was said to be a national security investigation.",Germany's frankfurter allegemeine zeitung says india will not bow to u.s. pressure.

One nation has a flying F-35 and you have built a floating F35, that too Made in India,"" he added.Highlighting the growing importance of maritime power, the defence minister said the geo-strategic situation to India's west had a direct bearing on the country’s economic growth.He stressed that the Navy’s role was not confined to protecting the seas but extended to safeguarding national economic security.""The geo-strategic situation here (western region) is such that it also has the ability to directly influence our economic development. Our energy requirements, oil, natural gas, all depend on the security of this region to a great extent. Therefore, the role of the Navy is not only limited to the protection of the sea, but it is also a major pillar of our national economic security,"" he said.On the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, in which Indian tourists were killed, Rajnath said the country had responded firmly.""The attack on our innocent people was a challenge for us, but India gave an effective and precise response through ' Operation Sindoor ',"" he said, describing it as a crossborder military offensive targeting terror havens in Pakistan.""I want to say that the Operation Sindoor is not over, it is only on pause.""Reiterating India's policy of peace but preparedness, the minister said, ""India has always given the message of peace to the world. India never wages war from its side. History shows it. If anyone poses a challenge to the country’s peace and security then we know to give a befitting reply and will continue to do so.""He pointed out the challenges in the Indian Ocean, where global power rivalries often intersect. ""The power play going on in the Indian Ocean frequently alerts us. Here interests of several countries clash. And due to this, there is a need for India to strengthen its maritime preparedness,"" he said.Speaking on the Navy’s long journey in indigenous warship design, Rajnath said it took nearly 50 years for the Warship Design Bureau to reach 100 ships, but expressed hope the number would double in the next 25 years.On the new frigates, he said, ""Commissioning of INS Udaygiri and INS Himgiri is a dream come true towards Atmanirbhar Bharat . I can say with confidence that both these warships will prove to be a milestone in the country’s security.""""These warships will not only strengthen the security system, but will also naturally strengthen humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions,"" he added.He further said, ""I believe that their commissioning in the Indian Navy is a step that will strengthen our neighborhood first and mutual and holistic advancement for security and growth for all in the region.""According to Rajnath, the induction of INS Udaygiri and INS Himgiri demonstrates that India is ""fully capable of protecting its maritime borders and is ready to react immediately in any situation.""""The Indian Navy not only guards coastal areas, but also keeps peace and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region,"" he said.The minister underlined that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, the defence sector had been prioritised and modernised. ""Hi-tech equipment which only few countries used to possess earlier, India is now designing and manufacturing them,"" he said, adding that INS Tamal would be the last foreign-built ship to join the Indian Navy.Rajnath said the armed forces were being strengthened with a futuristic vision, and the commissioning of INS Udaygiri and INS Himgiri would significantly enhance the Navy’s strength, reach and resilience.""These warships are modern and very important systems,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: A day after a group of retired judges criticised Union home minister Amit Shah for his remarks on the Salwa Judum judgment of opposition vice-presidential nominee Justice B Sudershan Reddy, another set of 56 retired judges issued a counter statement with ""strong disagreement"" on Tuesday.This group, which included four former Supreme Court judges, former Chief Justices P Sathasivam, Ranjan Gogoi, AK Sikri and former judge MR Shah, urged their ""brother judges"" to ""desist from lending their names to politically motivated statements.""""Let those who have chosen the path of politics defend themselves in that realm. The institution of the judiciary must be kept above and distinct from such entanglements,"" the 56 judges said in their statement.They pointed to a ""predictable pattern"" where every major political development is followed by statements from the same group of people, which they said try to “cloak their political partisanship under the language of judicial independence.”On Justice Reddy’s decision to contest as the INDIA bloc’s vice-presidential candidate, the statement said this was his personal choice. “A fellow retired judge has chosen, of his own volition, to contest the election for the office of the Vice President of India.By doing so, he has stepped into the political arena as a candidate supported by the opposition. Having made that choice, he must defend his candidacy like any other contestant, in the realm of political debate. To suggest otherwise is to stifle democratic discourse and to misuse the cover of judicial independence for political convenience.”The statement further said: ""Judicial independence is not threatened by the criticism of a political candidate. What truly tarnishes the reputation of the judiciary is when former judges repeatedly issue partisan statements, giving the impression that the institution itself is aligned with political battles. As a result of these tactics, because of the fault of a few, the larger body of judges ends up being painted as partisan coterie. This is neither fair nor healthy for India’s judiciary or democracy.”A day earlier in Kerala, Amit Shah had attacked Justice Reddy over his past ruling on Salwa Judum, a state-backed anti-Naxalite campaign in Chhattisgarh. Shah said, “Sudershan Reddy is the person who helped Naxalism. He gave Salwa Judum judgment. If the Salwa Judum judgment had not been given, the Naxal terrorism would have ended by 2020. He is the person who was inspired by the ideology that gave Salwa Judum judgment. ""On the same day, a different group of 18 retired Supreme Court judges wrote separately to Amit Shah, objecting to his comments against Justice Reddy. They described Shah’s remarks as ""unfortunate"" and advised that it would be wise to refrain from ""name-calling.""","B sudershan reddy is the opposition vice-presidential nominee.

Bhagwat: RSS endured a century of hostility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bhagwat-rss-endured-a-century-of-hostility/articleshow/123534627.cms,".

New Delhi: Casting the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 's centenary as both vindication of its importance and presentation of a fresh challenge, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said the organisation had endured a century of neglect, hostility and bans to emerge as a force of acceptance, and used the occasion to define Hindu identity as inclusive and rooted, not in territory but in devotion to Bharat Mata and the traditions of ancestors.Speaking at ""100 Years Journey of RSS: New Horizons"" at Vigyan Bhawan, Bhagwat said RSS's founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar had participated in all four streams of the freedom struggle - revolutionary, political, social reform and spiritual renaissance - and was remembered as a ""born patriot."" Hedgewar, he noted, had concluded that leaders, policies and parties may be useful but are secondary to the objective of society's transformation.Tracing the Sangh's path, the Sarsanghchalak said, ""there is much discourse regarding the Sangh... the available information is limited and often inauthentic. It is imperative to present the truth and accurate details,"" urging people to form a view about the organisation ""based on facts and not on perception"".As he traced Sangh's journey, a micro movie showed a 3,000-strong RSS contingent participating in the Republic Day parade of 1963 at the instance of Nehru, ""the very same person"", the commentary emphasised, ""who had banned the organisation citing the assassination of Gandhi.He said that Sangh believed in bringing people together and welding them into a team for the pursuit of building India as a powerful nation. ""Coming together is beginning, staying together is progress and working together is success,"" said Bhagwat as he detailed the process of sculpting an individual into the ""new man"" of RSS's conception, right since their initial days in an RSS Shakha.Despite bans, attacks and vilification, the Sangh had spread from small beginnings to every corner of the country, he said, because of the selfless dedication of swayamsevaks. With no paid staff and no external funding, the organisation continued to grow only on the basis of voluntary efforts.The gathering reflected the wider audience the Sangh seeks to engage, drawing diplomats from over two dozen embassies, including major powers and neighbours; members of think tanks such as ORF, Infinity Foundation, HSS and TEDx India; and corporate representatives. The lecture series will continue till Thursday with Bhagwat scheduled to engage with Indian and international voices.","Rashtriya swayamsevak sangh celebrates its centenary.

The remarks came ahead of PM Narendra Modi ’s visit to Japan this week, during which the 2 sides will review cooperation to promote a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.Significantly, the US joined India in reaffirming in a joint statement its commitment to promoting a safer, stronger and more Indo-Pacific region through the Quad in a virtual 2 + 2 Intersessional Dialogue between senior officials this week.Misri said that Quad cooperation will be discussed when Modi meets his Japan counterpart Shigeru Ishiba for the annual India-Japan visit on Friday. Modi will depart on Thursday for a 2-day visit to Japan en route to China.Some of the likely outcomes from Modi’s visit to Japan include an upgrade of the 2008 joint declaration on security cooperation to make it more in sync with current realities and an announcement, as reported by the Japanese media last week, by Japan about investment worth $ 68 billion in India over the next 10 years.The 2 sides will look to boost defence and security cooperation with focus on defence exercises and technology transfer, while also launching an economic security initiative.During the visit, Modi is also likely to travel in a bullet train from Tokyo to Sendai where he’s expected to visit a semiconductor facility.Japan is also hoping that India and the US will be able to resolve their differences in time for a successful Quad summit later this year. With India-US ties in a flux, it’s anybody’s guess as to whether President Donald Trump will visit India for the summit this year.Misri said that in recent years, Quad’s agenda has expanded to take on issues of practical cooperation and health security. “It covers critical and emerging technologies. There's an initiative with regard to critical minerals that has been discussed recently. Overall, with regard to how to make supply chains more resilient, and also infrastructure development. So, these are all issues that are a priority, both for India and for Japan,” said Misri.“Both our countries attach high value to this forum and to this partnership. And we look forward to working with all Quad partners to take our cooperation forward. I'm sure when the two prime ministers meet, the Quad will be a subject that will be discussed between the two of them,’’ he added.","Quad is an important platform for working on and promoting peace, stability, prosperity, and development in the indo-pacific region.

New Delhi: Ahead of PM Narendra Modi's visit to Tianjin in China for the SCO summit, govt on Tuesday said India was seeking a strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the Tianjin declaration, the joint statement that will follow the summit.Senior officials recalled that when SCO was established, one of its main objectives was to counter challenges to peace and security arising from terrorism, separatism and extremism.MEA secretary (west) Tanmaya Lal, in a joint briefing with foreign secretary Vikram Misri, said while the declaration text was still being finalised, India was working with other member-states to ensure there was a reiteration of the strong condemnation of terrorism.This will be the first meeting of the SCO leaders after the Pahalgam attack and India expects the declaration to reflect the solidarity expressed by the international community. It remains to be seen, however, if there is any mention of Pahalgam in the joint statement as Pakistan is likely to either oppose it, or insist on the mention of terrorist activities on its soil for which it might have blamed India.Modi is expected to reach China on Aug 30 for the SCO summit. On the margins, he is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Chinese and Russian presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.","India is seeking a strong condemnation of cross-border terrorism in the tianjin declaration, the joint statement that will follow the summit.

New Delhi: Maharashtra, through senior lawyer Harish Salve, told Supreme Court on Tuesday that the Constitution empowers a governor or the President, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill. It made a five-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai ask: ""Is this the federal governance structure envisaged by Constitution framers?""Making good his argument, Salve, who has moved to the UK and is now the King's Counsel, told the bench of CJI Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar that the Constitution mandates that the President will always be bound by the aid and advice of the Union council of ministers led by the PM but there is no such provision of aid and advice by state council of ministers for a governor on a bill passed by an assembly.He said when a governor reserves a bill for the consideration of the President, the latter will either grant or withhold assent based on the advice of the PM-led council of ministers. If a governor or the President withholds assent, the bill falls through, Salve said, adding that the framers of the Constitution intended a federal governance where Parliament/President will have the last word on framing of laws, not the assemblies.","Senior lawyer harish salve told supreme court that the constitution empowers a governor or the president, not an assembly, to have the final say on a state bill.

New Delhi: Supreme Court ordered on Tuesday an inquiry into the disclosure by a judicial member of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma, that he was approached by ""one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country"" to decide a case in favour of a particular litigant.Sources told TOI that the inquiry would be conducted by the secretary general of the apex court to find out who was the judge, from HCs or SC, who allegedly attempted to influence the outcome of a case. The revelation came after a bench headed by Justice Sharma passed a brief order recusing himself from the case as ""someone from higher judiciary tried to influence him"". Though Sharma did not name anyone, ""the higher judiciary of the country"" is used to refer to SC and HCs.""We are anguished to observe, that one of us, Member (Judicial), has been approached by one of the most revered members of the higher judiciary of this country for seeking an order in favour of a particular party.

It's T-Day: India braces for impact as Trump's 50% tariff kicks in today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-t-day-india-braces-for-impact-as-trumps-50-tariff-kicks-in-today/articleshow/123533977.cms,".

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

The United States on Monday declared what is effectively a limited trade war on India, notifying a 50% tariff (25% taxes plus 25% penalty) on most goods imports from India.Issued by the department of homeland security, the notification said the tariffs are in response to ""threats to the United States by the govt of the Russian Federation"", and it is implementing a presidential order that had determined it is ""necessary and appropriate"" to impose tariffs on India, ""which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil"".The notification was India-specific and made no mention of China, which imports more Russian oil than India, making it clear that Trump is wilfully singling out New Delhi for punishment even as he gives a wide berth to Beijing and is openly cosy with Moscow despite expressing frustration over the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.Administration officials, MAGA principals and analysts have proffered a range of reasons, from oil revenues from India fuelling the Russian war effort to New Delhi's role in BRICS' purported attempt to undermine the US dollar, to New Delhi not recognising Trump's self-professed role in bringing about a truce between India and Pakistan, for what some experts say are clearly disproportionate and vengeful tariffs.Trump himself, and White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt, have used the word ""sanctions"" to describe the punitive taxes. The notification, coming hours after PM Modi defiantly indicated that India would not buckle under pressure, will kick in at midnight Aug 27 EST (Aug 27, 9.30am IST).At that time, nearly half of India's $87.3 billion goods exported to the US will be subjected to a 50% tax.The affected sectors include textiles and apparels, gems and jewellery, seafood (mainly shrimp) and leather goods.The Indian pharmaceutical industry, a critical supplier of generic drugs to the US, and electronics and smartphones (including Apple iPhones), are exempted from the tariffs.While some of the tariff costs may be borne by Indian exporters cutting prices and US importers paying more at the other end, it will still make Indian exports non-competitive against exporters from countries in the neighbourhood who pay tariffs in the 10%-25% range. The consequent drop in orders from the US, which is India's biggest market for such products, is expected to hurt hundreds of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) with resultant layoffs and unemployment.Analysts estimate a GDP reduction between 0.2% to 1% in FY26, with a potential economic contraction of $7 billion to $25 billion, depending on price adjustments and finding new markets. More broadly, the impact of the tariffs is moderated by India's economy being driven largely by domestic consumption, with exports to the US accounting for 2%-2.5% of GDP.","U.s. declares what is effectively a limited trade war on india. 50% tariff (25% taxes plus 25% penalty) on most goods imports from india.

NSE holidays 2025 list

Stock market holiday today: Indian stock markets will suspend operations on Wednesday, August 27 on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi. This represents the second market holiday in August, following the earlier closure on August 15 for Independence Day celebrations, apart from the routine weekend offs.Operations at both BSE and NSE will cease completely for the day, affecting all trading segments including equities, derivatives, and SLB operations. Regular trading activities will commence the following day, August 28.For commodity trading, MCX will operate partially, remaining closed during morning hours but resuming evening operations. NCDEX, which primarily handles agricultural commodities trading, will observe a complete shutdown for the day.These scheduled interruptions can potentially affect market behaviour upon reopening, as traders process global market developments that occurred during the closure. Investors typically monitor international indicators, including US market performance and global commodity prices, which influence local trading patterns upon resumption.This closure coincides with Trump's additional 25 per cent tariffs that are set to go into effect on the same day.Also read: Bank holiday on Ganesh Chaturthi- Are banks open or closed today?
