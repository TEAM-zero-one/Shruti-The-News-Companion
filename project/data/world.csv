Air India crash: Importance of Black Box

Black Box: Decoding Air India plane crash

Air India Ahmedabad plane crash: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) will determine where to decode the black box from Air India's crashed Dreamliner, according to a government announcement on Thursday. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has launched a comprehensive investigation into the June 12 incident that claimed approximately 270 lives, utilising a team of experts from various disciplines.""It has been reported that the CVR/DFDR (black box) from the ill-fated AI171 flight is being sent abroad for retrieval and analysis...The decision regarding the location for decoding the flight recorders will be taken by the AAIB after due assessment of all technical, safety, and security considerations,"" the statement said.Earlier today, an ET report had said that India plans to send the severely damaged black box from the Air India Boeing 787 crash to the United States for detailed analysis. Due to extensive fire damage after the plane crash, data extraction in India has proven unfeasible, the report had said.The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), collectively known as black box, are painted bright orange and are near the aircraft's tail section where crash impact is typically minimal.However, these devices often sustain significant damage from crash impact or subsequent fires.The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) will undergo examination at the National Safety Transport Board (NTSB) laboratory in Washington, sources had told ET.Read | Air India crash: Govt tightens aircraft safety rules; structures violating height limit under lens During crash investigations, the black boxes provide vital information. The flight data recorder captures essential technical measurements including timing, altitude and airspeed, whilst the CVR stores important audio data from the cockpit, encompassing pilot dialogues and background sounds such as electronic warning signals from cockpit systems.According to the source quoted by the financial daily, retrieving data from these recording devices can take anywhere between two days to several months, based on how severely the units are damaged.""Due to damage to the recorder, we need to extract the chip by removing the memory board to prevent further data loss. We also need to evaluate the condition of the electronic circuit,"" the person explained.The Boeing 787, similar to other modern aircraft, is made with multiple backup systems and duplicate critical components to ensure operational safety and reliability. The aircraft is capable of maintaining flight for 345 minutes using a single engine, even with various system malfunctions.The investigation team is analysing several scenarios, including whether wing flaps were correctly deployed and the reason for landing gear deployment. They are also investigating potential electronic malfunctions or fuel contamination that could cause engine failures.The pilot's final communication was a single Mayday emergency call. According to Samir Kumar Sinha, secretary of the civil aviation ministry, there was no subsequent response to air traffic control.Also read| Former Air India staffers claim they exposed Boeing 787 Dreamliner door glitch in 2024; seek PM Narendra Modi's intervention","The aircraft accident investigation bureau has launched a comprehensive investigation into the june 12 incident that claimed approximately 270 lives.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi strongly raised the issue of terrorism in his G7 outreach session address, describing the Pahalgam attack as an assault on all humanity and slamming double standards in the fight against terror. Without naming Pakistan, he said India's neighbourhood had become a breeding ground for terrorism.Modi raised several questions about the international approach to terrorism, saying that while sanctions were being imposed based on personal preferences, nations that openly supported terrorism continued to be rewarded.""Are we truly serious about addressing terrorism? Will we understand the true meaning of terrorism only when it knocks on our own doors? Can those who spread terror and those who suffer from it be weighed on the same scale? Are our global institutions at risk of losing their credibility?"" he asked, while also talking about the impact of ongoing conflicts on the Global South.The PM said turning a blind eye towards terrorism for the sake of vested interests, or extending support to terror or terrorists, was a betrayal of all humanity.If we don't take decisive action today against this terrorism that stands against humanity, history will never forgive us,"" the PM said.Modi also said the terrorist attack that took place on April 22 was not just an assault on Pahalgam but a direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity of every Indian.It was an assault on all humanity, he said.""Terrorism is the enemy of humanity. It stands in opposition to all nations that uphold democratic values. Unity in fight against terrorism is imperative. Unfortunately, our own neighbourhood has become a breeding ground for terrorism. For the sake of global peace, our thinking and our policies must be extremely clear - any country that supports terrorism must be held accountable and made to pay the price,"" the PM said.Modi also said the countries of the Global South were having to bear the maximum impact of uncertainty and conflicts. No matter where the tension was in the world, he said, these countries were the first to be affected by food, fuel, fertiliser and financial crises.""India considers it its responsibility to bring the priorities and concerns of the Global South to the world stage.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal on Tuesday called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" and criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma, in whose storeroom a huge amount of cash was found.Saibal alleged that the government's ""real motive"" behind the action against Varma is to ""dismantle"" the Collegium system and ""gain control over judicial appointments"".He also accused the government of selectively pursuing the case against Varma while ignoring similar proceedings against Justice Shekhar Yadav, who faces an impeachment notice from Opposition MPs over allegedly ""communal"" remarks made last year.""I can say with the utmost of responsibility that he (Varma) is one of the finest judges that I have argued before. You ask any lawyer in the High Court or the Supreme Court, and there is not a whiff of any wrongdoing by this judge. You ask any lawyer in Allahabad (Prayagraj)...judges know their lawyers...lawyers also know the judges,"" Sibal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He furher said: ""It is shocking that you (the government) are targeting a judge against whom there is no evidence and you are protecting a judge against whom there is no evidence required because his statement is in the public domain and there is an impeachment motion pending before the Chairman and he has been sitting on it for verification of signatures.""Rijiju is reportedly planning to introduce a motion on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament to make the Supreme Court's in-house inquiry report on Justice Varma public.""For what? Why are you protecting Shekhar Yadav?"" Sibal questioned.The senior advocate alleged that the opposition is failing to recognise the broader agenda to strip the Collegium of its authority and reinstate the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).""This is the whole purpose of this exercise,"" Sibal claimed.Criticising the government’s handling of the matter, Sibal said a decision was taken against a sitting high court judge without following due process.""The judge was not even heard. This is absolutely shocking...Unfortunately, the political class is brought into the act,"" he remarked.The controversy surfaced after a fire incident at Justice Varma's residence in Delhi in March, during his tenure at the Delhi high court. The blaze reportedly led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of cash in an outhouse on the property.However, contrary to Sibal's claims, a three-judge inquiry panel's damning report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna confirmed that a huge amount of cash was found in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's Tughlaq Crescent residence on March 14.The report repudiated Justice Varma's repeated statements claiming innocence about the discovery of money from a room within his official residence.","Rajya sabha mp kapil sibal calls justice yashwant varma ""one of the finest judges"" accuses government of selectively pursuing case against varma while ignoring similar proceedings against justice shekhar yadav.

Juneteenth, the US’s newest federal holiday, falls on Thursday, June 19, 2025, and it means a day off for many institutions, including Wall Street.If you're planning to trade, deposit a cheque, or run errands that day, here's what you need to know about what’s open and what’s not.No, both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed on Thursday, June 19, in observance of Juneteenth.Juneteenth is part of the official holiday calendar followed by US financial markets, which means there will be no trading activity throughout the day. Markets will resume operations on Friday, June 20.Major banks like Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America, and TD Bank will also remain closed as Juneteenth is a Federal Reserve-recognised banking holiday.However, customers can still access ATMs and online banking platforms, though some transactions may face delays due to the holiday, reported Today.com.Don't expect regular USPS deliveries.

Khan network. Iran, as an NPT signatory, was subject to IAEA inspections and international oversight, making overt assistance from Pakistan highly risky.

Could recent conflict change Pakistan's stance?

What was the AQ Khan network?







As the fiery tensions between Israel and Iran escalate into a full-blown conflict, with Israel launching deep strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and US President Donald Trump hinting that America might soon join the fray, the spotlight turns to the complex web of alliances and rivalries in the region.Amid this turmoil, a puzzling question emerges: why did Pakistan , often calling itself Iran's ""brother"" in the Muslim world and a nuclear-armed state itself, refrain from openly helping Tehran develop nuclear weapons?Despite clandestine proliferation links in the past, Pakistan has consistently stopped short of enabling Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. This restraint reflects a tangled mix of geopolitical calculations, sectarian divides, and international pressures that have shaped Pakistan’s cautious stance toward Iran's nuclear program — even as both nations share strategic interests and a history of cooperation.Pakistan became a nuclear weapons state in 1998, while Iran has long sought nuclear technology -- officially for peaceful purposes, but with suspicions of developing a weapons programme.Despite both being Muslim-majority states with some historical cooperation, Pakistan did not openly or officially help Iran build nuclear weapons, and their nuclear trajectories diverged for several reasons.However, it turns out Pakistan did secretly aid Iran, but only to a point.In the 1980s and 1990s, Pakistan's A.Q. Khan network clandestinely transferred sensitive centrifuge technology, blueprints, and components to Iran, which significantly advanced Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities.T he centrifuge designs Iran used in its Natanz enrichment plant closely resembled those developed at Pakistan's Kahuta facility, which were themselves based on stolen European designs.The facility was recently targeted by Israel and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that both above-ground facilities as well as the underground centrifuge halls have been destroyed.Regional tensions and the escalating Israel-Iran conflict have intensified speculation about Pakistan's stance on Iran’s nuclear ambitions.While Pakistan has openly expressed political solidarity with Iran — calling for Muslim unity against Israel and condemning Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites — it has firmly maintained a defensive nuclear doctrine and denied any commitment to actively support Iran’s nuclear weapons program or engage militarily, including with nuclear weapons.Despite fiery rhetoric from some Iranian officials claiming Pakistan would retaliate against Israel if Iran were attacked with nuclear weapons, Pakistani leaders have categorically rejected such claims as fabricated and irresponsible.The AQ Khan network was a clandestine nuclear proliferation network led by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani metallurgical engineer known as the ""father of Pakistan’s nuclear bomb."".Starting in the 1970s, Khan acquired uranium enrichment centrifuge technology and parts primarily from European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, and France.He used this technology to build Pakistan's nuclear programme but simultaneously established a black market network that sold nuclear technology and equipment to countries including Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The network operated through a complex web of international suppliers and middlemen spanning over 20 countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, South Africa, Switzerland, South Korea, and Dubai.Khan's network supplied not only centrifuge components but also technical expertise and even nuclear weapons designs, effectively offering turnkey nuclear weapons programmes to buyers. This illicit trade was financially lucrative, with Khan reportedly receiving over $100 million from sales to Libya alone.The network was exposed in 2003 after international intelligence agencies intercepted shipments, most notably the German-registered cargo ship BBC China bound for Libya carrying centrifuge parts.This led to Libya's decision to dismantle its nuclear programme and name Khan as the supplier.Khan publicly admitted to his role in nuclear proliferation in 2004 and was placed under house arrest by Pakistani authorities, though he was released in 2009. The network's operations involved shell companies based in Dubai used to facilitate shipments and obscure transactions.Khan's activities blurred the line between state and non-state actors, with evidence suggesting possible awareness or complicity by elements within the Pakistani military and government, although official denials persist. The network's impact was profound, spreading nuclear weapons capability to multiple states and raising ongoing concerns about nuclear proliferation risks worldwide.","Despite clandestine proliferation links in the past, pakistan has consistently stopped short of enabling iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.

Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Dragging his feet to the truth after repeated denials, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday admitted that India struck Rawalpindi's Nur Khan airbase and the Shorkot airbase during Operation Sindoor , which was carried to avenge the Pahalgam terrorist attack, in which ISI-groomed terrorists killed 26 civilians.India attacked the Nur Khan and Shorkot airbases on the intervening night of May 6 and 7. Within 45 minutes of the strike, Saudi Prince Faisal offered to speak to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on behalf of Pakistan's deputy PM, seeking to halt further action against Pakistan.Dar's statement strongly suggests that Islamabad desperately scrambled to find help in persuading India to halt its kinetic action, which was ""precise, measured and non-escalatory"". Pakistan air force Base Nur Khan, situated in Chaklala, Rawalpindi is around 10km from Islamabad, Pakistan capital. It is an active airbase that encompasses the former Benazir Bhutto International Airport within its grounds.The facility, originally established as RAF Station Chaklala and later known as PAF Base Chaklala, continues to serve as a vital military installation in Pakistan.The base is also home to PAF College Chaklala, which trains Aviation Cadets, and Fazaia Inter College Nur Khan, providing additional educational facilities on the premises.Imtiaz Gul, a defence analyst, claimed that the strategically important Nur Khan airbase in Rawalpindi is “under American control.”Pakistan air force base Rafiqui, situated near Shorkot in Jhang District, is a major military installation located 337 kilometers south of Islamabad. The base features a 10,000-foot runway with a parallel taxiway that serves as an emergency landing strip.The airbase was previously known as PAF Base Shorkot before being renamed after Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui, a fighter pilot from the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.The base's infrastructure includes a primary runway and an emergency taxiway system that allows for aircraft recovery operations when needed.Operation Sindoor was India's swift, calculated tri‑service cross-border assault on the dead night of May 6 and 7, targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan‑occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the brutal April 22 Pahalgam massacre that claimed 26 innocent lives.Within 25 minutes, India’s Army, Navy and Air Force deployed SCALP cruise missiles, HAMMER smart bombs, loitering munitions and ground-to-ground weaponry, killing around 70 to 100 militants and crippling key Lashkar‑e‑Taiba, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure at Bahalwalpur and Muridke in Pakistan.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion. Via the name Operation Sindoor, the government sent an immeasurably bigger message back as India avenged the loss suffered by those women.Sindoor, vermillion, is a symbol of marriage in Hindu custom. Pakistan's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after government's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.","India attacked the nur khan and shorkot airbases on the intervening night of may 6 and 7.

'Not asking for US green light': Netanyahu says Israel will hit all nuclear sites in Iran; quiet on eliminating Khamenei,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/not-asking-for-us-green-light-netanyahu-says-israel-will-hit-all-nuclear-sites-in-iran-eliminating-khamenei/articleshow/121964429.cms,"



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will not wait for a US green light to continue its military campaign against Iran and is fully committed to hitting all Iranian nuclear sites — including the heavily fortified Fordo facility.""We will achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear facilities. We have the capability to do that,"" Netanyahu declared in a rare Hebrew-language interview with the Kan public broadcaster, underscoring Israel’s determination to act decisively and independently.The comment came hours after US President Donald Trump said he will decide whether to join Israel's strikes on Iran within the next two weeks as there is still a ""substantial"" chance of talks to end the conflict. ""Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,"" Trump had said in a statement.Netanyahu emphasised that Israel is proceeding with its campaign regardless of whether the United States decides to join the offensive. “Whether US President Donald Trump wants to join or not — that’s entirely his decision,” he said.“He’ll do what’s good for the United States, and I’ll do what’s good for the State of Israel.” The prime minister stressed that Israel is not asking for permission or a “green light” from any foreign power.“Either way, we’re going to do this, because we have no choice. We will not allow 3,500 years of Jewish history to come to an end because of this deranged ayatollah,” Netanyahu declared, referencing Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Netanyahu outlined Israel’s comprehensive strategy to neutralise Iran’s nuclear threat by targeting every nuclear facility, including the underground Fordo site, which is widely considered one of the most secure and difficult to strike.“We have the capability to do that,” he said confidently, signaling Israel’s readiness to deploy advanced military assets to destroy even the most heavily fortified targets.The prime minister reported that Israel is “ahead of schedule” in its campaign, having already destroyed at least half of Iran’s missile launchers and eliminated key military leaders. He highlighted ongoing strikes against paramilitary forces such as the Basij militia, which plays a critical role in suppressing dissent within Iran. Netanyahu also noted that Israel has inflicted “heavy damage” on the regime’s internal security apparatus and will continue to target symbols of the Iranian government.While Israel is prepared to act independently, Netanyahu acknowledged the importance of US support.He revealed that he speaks with President Trump almost daily and described their conversations as “very good.”However, he declined to disclose details, saying, “Let’s not call on the historical archive to release itself just yet.”Netanyahu praised Trump’s recognition of Israel’s right to self-defense, contrasting it with former President Joe Biden’s attempts to restrict Israeli operations against Iranian proxies.On the question of regime change, Netanyahu reiterated that it is ultimately up to the Iranian people.“The issue of regime change or the downfall of this administration primarily concerns the Iranian populace,” he said.Nonetheless, he emphasized that Israel is striking government targets and symbols of the regime and that “there’s more to come.” Netanyahu described Iran’s Supreme Leader as a “deranged ayatollah” threatening the future of the Jewish people and stressed that Israel will do “everything necessary” to neutralize the existential threat posed by Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Asked whether Khamenei is a dead man walking, he replied: ""I gave instructions that no one is immune. I prefer not to deal with [making] headlines and to let actions speak for themselves.""“During a war words have to be chosen with care, and actions with precision,"" he said adding that he expects this “from my ministers as well"", an implied criticism of defense minister Israel Katz, who has been publicly threatening Khamenei.",Prime minister benjamin netanyahu says israel will not wait for a us green light to continue its military campaign against iran.

Israel reportedly floated such plans to the Obama administration years ago. Air supremacy tactics: With Israel having temporarily gained air dominance over large swathes of Iran, it could loiter over Fordow and disrupt activities, although this wouldn't eliminate the facility.

Would the US step in?



Why the stakes are so high







As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, a chilling question arises: Could this spiral into a nuclear crisis? In the past five days, the situation has worsened, with Israel reportedly targeting nuclear sites in Tehran. Experts warn that any further escalation could be catastrophic. At the heart of these rising tensions lies Iran’s most secretive and fortified nuclear facility, Fordow.Tucked deep beneath a mountain near Qom, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is one of Iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites. Its underground design—80 to 90 meters below the surface—makes it virtually impenetrable to aerial strikes, even with the most advanced bunker-buster bombs in Israel’s arsenal. Originally exposed in 2009 through Western intelligence, Fordow was built in secrecy and designed for survivability, especially in the face of potential military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.What makes Fordow particularly alarming to global powers is its capacity to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade. According to the IAEA, the site now houses 2,700 centrifuges and has been enriching uranium to 60%—a short technical step away from the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), uranium enriched to 83.7% purity was found at the site in 2023, dangerously close to the 90% enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.Experts warn that Iran could produce enough material for multiple bombs in just weeks if it chooses to weaponize its stockpile. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility, raising the stakes of any military or diplomatic attempt to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster—that might reach its buried core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes. For Iran, Fordow is a nuclear insurance policy. For the world, it is a red line—and possibly a countdown.""The Iranians fully understood that the Israelis would try to get inside their programs, and they built Fordo inside of a mountain a long time ago to take care of the post-Iraq problem,"" said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.Only one known weapon could potentially take out Fordow: the US-made 30,000-pound bomb. This bomb, also called ""bunker buster,"" is capable of burrowing through rock and steel before detonating.But there's a catch: Israel doesn't have it. The United States has consistently denied Israeli requests for the bomb, citing fears that its use could provoke a full-scale regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said general Joseph Votel, former head of US central command.While Israel lacks the bunker buster or a heavy bomber to deliver it, it hasn't given up on options:""The Israelis have sprung a lot of clandestine operations lately,"" said general Kenneth McKenzie Jr, former commander of US central command. ""But the physics of the problem remain the same.""While the US has moved aircraft and refuelling tankers into the region, there's no indication yet that US President Donald Trump is prepared to shift long-standing US policy and provide Israel with the bomb. Officials warn that deploying it would involve complex coordination and risk significant collateral and geopolitical fallout.""If we use the bunker buster, there could be nuclear contamination,"" general Votel said. ""I think there would also certainly be fallout internationally over the idea that the United States joined Israel in what would be viewed as an illegal attack on the sovereignty of Iran,"" he added.Fordow is not just a physical challenge—it is a political one. An Israeli strike on the site, especially with US involvement, could trigger Iranian retaliation against American assets across the Middle East and plunge the region into another war.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But with enrichment levels rising and regional threats mounting, international anxiety over Fordow continues to grow.Fordow symbolises the nuclear stalemate between Iran and its adversaries. For Israel, it represents the limits of its conventional reach. For the US, it is a geopolitical tripwire. And for Iran, it remains a testament to strategic foresight in the face of existential threats. As the Middle East teeters on the edge of a broader conflict, what happens—or does n't—at Fordow could shape the course of history.","Fordow fuel enrichment plant is one of iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites.

Huge FIREBALL As Iranian Missile Dodges Iron Dome, Explodes In Between Tel Aviv Skyscrapers

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on Thursday after being struck by an Iranian ballistic missile, marking one of the most direct attacks on Israel's economic infrastructure since hostilities erupted.The strike was part of a wider Iranian missile barrage that targeted multiple locations across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva, as per Al Jazeera and local media reports.The attack marks a significant escalation on the seventh day of direct conflict between the two long-time rivals.“This morning, Iran's terrorist dictators fired missiles at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheva and at civilians in the centre of the country,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X. “We will make the tyrants in Tehran pay a heavy price,” he added, condemning the strikes on civilian infrastructure, including the hospital and the stock exchange.According to Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service, at least 47 people were injured during the attacks, with 18 more hurt while rushing to bomb shelters.Soroka Hospital in Be’er Sheva suffered a direct hit. The hospital director confirmed “several wards were completely demolished and there is extensive damage across the medical centre,” reported AFP.Iran, on its part, said its missiles were aimed at Israeli military and intelligence installations. Iranian state media reported the operation was part of “True Promise 3,” launched in retaliation for Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion”—a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets that began on June 13. On Thursday, Israel responded by targeting Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. Iranian state television said the facility had been evacuated and that “there is no radiation danger whatsoever. ”The strikes on Tel Aviv and Be’er Sheva came as tensions reached a boiling point following Israel’s repeated attacks on Iranian nuclear infrastructure, including recent airstrikes on over 20 military and nuclear sites across Tehran, Natanz, and Arak.According to CNN, the Israeli Air Force deployed 60 fighter jets to strike centrifuge production and R&D sites linked to Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.The missile that hit the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange comes as both countries continue to exchange daily barrages. An Israeli military official, quoted by AFP, said that since the conflict began, Iran has launched around 400 ballistic missiles and 1,000 drones. Of these, around 20 missiles have landed in civilian areas of Israel, the official said.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has hinted at possible intervention but stopped short of confirming any military action. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he told reporters. “I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due, because things change. Especially with war.”Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has dismissed US demands, saying: “This nation will never surrender,” and warned of “irreparable damage” if the US intervenes.Both nations continue to count mounting casualties. As of the last official update, at least 24 Israelis had been killed and hundreds wounded, according to Netanyahu’s office. Iran said over 220 people, including military commanders and civilians, had died from Israeli strikes, though neither side has released updated figures since.","The tel aviv stock exchange building reportedly suffered extensive damage on thursday after being struck by an iranian ballistic missile.

Iran's Nuclear Ambitions





While President Donald J. Trump was issuing fresh warnings from the White House — “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s very simple.” — a more peculiar nuclear mystery was unfolding online. This one wasn’t about centrifuges spinning in Fordo or uranium stockpiles in Natanz. It was about Jeff.Specifically, a bar chart from CNN titled “World’s Nuclear Arsenals” listed the usual powers: Russia, the United States, France, China, the UK, and so on. But tucked away near the bottom, with fewer than 10 warheads, was an unexpected entrant: Jeff. No flag. No footnote. Just the name — as if he were a rogue microstate with a doomsday arsenal.So who is Jeff? To the casual viewer, Jeff might sound like a rogue nuclear actor. A breakaway republic? A tech billionaire with a uranium hobby? A bulky think tank guy?The answer is disappointingly rational. JEFF stands for the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion File, a nuclear data library maintained by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). It is not a country and does not possess weapons. It compiles nuclear reaction data for civilian applications — including power generation, reactor safety, and medical isotopes.The latest dataset, JEFF-3.3, released in 2017, is widely used across Europe.What likely happened is a labelling error: a dataset meant to be cited as the source of nuclear information was mistakenly interpreted as an entity with nuclear weapons. This misrepresentation, noted in a 2024 IFLScience article, shows how easily public understanding of complex topics can be distorted — especially when visualised without context.While social media turned Jeff into a fictional arms dealer, the real nuclear issue — Iran — continues to escalate. Trump’s administration, now back in office, has repeatedly stated that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is non-negotiable.Iran’s nuclear programme began under the Shah in the 1950s, with US support through President Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor was built with American assistance. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the programme was briefly suspended but revived in the 1980s with help from Pakistan, Russia, and China — this time without Western oversight.By the early 2000s, Iran’s nuclear activities drew intense scrutiny. In 2002, dissident groups revealed secret enrichment facilities at Natanz and Arak, prompting IAEA investigations. Iran maintained that its goals were peaceful — energy independence and medical research — but limited inspector access and evidence of weaponisation work raised alarms.This led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to restrict uranium enrichment and submit to international inspections in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, Trump withdrew from the deal, citing weak enforcement and sunset clauses.Since then, Iran has significantly expanded its enrichment activities. As of 2025, it is enriching uranium to 60% purity — just shy of weapons-grade — and is believed to have enough material for a bomb within weeks, if it chooses to proceed, according to IAEA assessments.Trump has responded with blunt consistency: “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Not as a slogan, but as a foreign policy red line.","A bar chart from cnn titled ‘world’s nuclear arsenals’ listed the usual powers: russia, the united states, france, china, the uk, and so on.

Indian student's deportation sparks outrage

Over 1,000 Indians deported in recent months

NEW DELHI: The US Embassy in India has issued a sharp warning to visa holders, reiterating that “a US visa is a privilege, not a right”, and that violating US laws, even after arrival, can lead to visa revocation and ineligibility for future travel.The statement, posted on the embassy’s official X handle on Thursday, emphasized that screening doesn’t end once a visa is issued, and any illegal activity, including drug use or breach of immigration laws while on a student or visitor visa, could have lasting consequences.“Using illegal drugs or breaking any US laws while on a student/visitor visa can make you ineligible for future US visas. A US visa is a privilege, not a right… and we may revoke your visa if you break the law,” the embassy said.This is the third such advisory from the US Embassy in India in June alone, each one stressing Washington’s firm stance against visa misuse and illegal immigration.On June 10, the embassy stated that while the United States welcomes legitimate travellers, it ""cannot and will not tolerate"" illegal entry or violation of laws. A follow-up on June 16 went a step further, noting that the US has established new visa restrictions on foreign officials and facilitators of mass or illegal immigration.The latest statement comes amid a surge in deportation cases and the circulation of a viral video showing an Indian student in handcuffs at Newark Airport, allegedly being deported. The clip, shared by Indian-American author Kunal Jain, triggered a wave of concern across Indian social media.“I witnessed a young Indian student being deported from Newark Airport last night, handcuffed, crying, treated like a criminal. He came chasing dreams, not causing harm,” Jain posted on X. He said the student appeared to be from Haryana and was heard shouting: “I’m not crazy… they are hell bent to prove that I am crazy.”Jain, who tagged the Indian Embassy and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, alleged that such deportations were becoming alarmingly routine. “Every day 3-4 such cases are happening,” he wrote, describing the student as “disoriented and helpless.”As per India's Ministry of External Affairs, 1,080 Indian nationals have been deported from the US since the Trump administration returned to power earlier this year.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between us president donald j trump and pakistan’s chief of army staff, field marshal syed asim munir, at the white house on thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

Antonio Brown’s bankruptcy was opposed in December 2024



Antonio Brown, one of the most popular and talented players in the NFL, has run into a huge controversy after it was alleged that he shot a man in Miami whom he had previously fought with. Recently, it was also alleged that the NFL legend ended up leaving the country and fled to the United Arab Emirates and is “on the run”. While Antonio Brown deals with this controversy, this isnt actually his first trouble with the law.Three years ago, in 2022, celebrity jeweller Shuki International, who has also previously worked for Kim Kardashian, filed a lawsuit against Antonion Brown.According to TMZ Sports, Shuki International alleged that Antonio Brown was sent a pair of diamond fingers, a ring and a white gold chain, which amounted to a whopping $1.095 million.Antonio Brown had reportedly received the jewellery on 24th February 2022 and had promised to pay $1.095 million for the jewellery by 1st December 2022, but he did not stay true to his word.In April 2023, Shuki International filed the lawsuit against Antonio Brown for failing to pay his dues but even till last year, things just kept getting worse.As per the New York Post, Jean Louis Shuki had alleged that even court orders had not compelled Antonio Brown to pay $1.095 million.Last year, Jean Louis Shuki spoke to the New York Post and said, “He’s a fanatic for the fingers…At this point, I don’t want the judgment, I just want the fingers back. They’re like the Mona Lisa.”Jean Louis Shuki added, “I still love and believe in this guy…I think we can do big business together. He has lots of talent and is legendary — but he also likes to create drama.”A few months after this, in May 2024, Antonio Brown declared bankruptcy and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At that point in time, the NFL legend owed a whopping $2.93 million to around eight creditors and declared assets worth $50,000.But in December 2024, as per court documents accessed by In Touch, Antonio Brown’s bankruptcy was opposed by the trustee for “failing to declare assets”.The trustee said, , “[Antonio] has failed to disclose his pre-petition [transfer] of property and his interests in various entities, has not timely or adequately complied with debtor reporting requirements, and cannot establish that his Plan is feasible.”Antonio Brown has not yet reacted to the whole lawsuit and what followed after.Also Read: “She was fidgety”: Taylor Swift's behaviour as she spoke about Travis Kelce has raised eyebrows amid rumours of an engagement","Antonio brown has run into a huge controversy after it was alleged that he shot a man in miami whom he had previously fought with.
