NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday reiterated the need for a fair and multipolar global order, stating, “Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. ”His remarks come amid global trade tensions, including US tariff threats and pressure on India’s oil trade with Russia.Speaking at the BIMSTEC Traditional Music Festival in Delhi titled SaptaSur: Seven Nations, One Melody, Jaishankar linked cultural traditions to the broader vision of global balance. “We live in complicated and uncertain times. Our collective desire is to see a fair and representative global order, not one dominated by a few. That quest is often articulated as political or economic rebalancing,” he said.Jaishankar noted that cultural traditions play a role in strengthening identity and guiding national direction. “Traditions are of particular value because ultimately they define identity. We must be assured about what we are if we want to be confident about shaping the future. For nations like us, traditions are truly a great source of strength,” he added.Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s earlier commitments, Jaishankar said, “I also want to underline what Director General of ICCR has said, that this was a commitment which was made by Prime Minister Modi at the BIMSTEC Summit and I am so glad that like so many of his commitments, that has been kept and kept early.”He also reflected on his personal journey and how cultural exposure shaped his outlook. “In my own case, it was actually through music and to some extent books that I developed an interest in the world. There is so much that music is able to convey that it is understandably regarded as the soul of a society,” he said.“Music serves both as a bridge between nations and a powerful expression of their heritage and identity,” he concluded.Jaishankar’s remarks come as India faces economic and diplomatic challenges, including concerns over possible US tariffs and warnings related to India’s ongoing oil trade with Russia.While the minister did not refer directly to these developments, his emphasis on sovereignty, tradition, and multipolarity echoed India’s current diplomatic positioning.","External affairs minister s jaishankar on monday reiterated the need for a fair and multipolar global order.

"'Unjustified and unreasonable': India calls out US, EU over oil trade with Russia; pans double standards",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unjustified-and-unreasonable-india-calls-out-us-eu-over-oil-trade-with-russia-pans-double-standards/articleshow/123100683.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Monday pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s threat to “substantially” raise tariffs on Indian goods over its continued oil imports from Russia, calling the targeting of India “unjustified and unreasonable. ”In a sharply worded statement, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) defended India’s energy strategy, saying that its crude oil purchases from Russia are “a necessity compelled by global market conditions” and not a political endorsement of Moscow.“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the MEA said in a statement, while pointing out that the US and European Union have themselves continued trade with Russia, including in energy and critical commodities, despite publicly opposing the Ukraine conflict.The response came hours after Trump accused India of “buying massive amounts of Russian oil and selling it on the open market for big profits,” and vowed to penalize New Delhi by raising tariffs. The US President had earlier signed an executive order on August 1 titled 'Further modifying the reciprocal tariff rates', slapping a 25% duty on Indian goods.While the executive order did not formally mention a “penalty” for Russian oil and military imports, Trump’s rhetoric has escalated over the past week.He previously said India and Russia could “take their dead economies down together,” prompting India to assert that it remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The MEA also pointed out what it called “double standards,” noting that the EU’s trade with Russia in 2024 was significantly higher than India’s. EU imports of Russian LNG, for instance, hit a record 16.5 million tonnes. The US too, the statement said, continues to import uranium, palladium, and fertilizers from Russia.India’s Russian oil imports rose from just 0.2% of total imports pre-war to over 35% in recent months, making Russia India’s top supplier. The MEA clarified that the shift occurred after traditional suppliers in the Middle East redirected exports to Europe post the Ukraine war.Despite tensions, India said it remains committed to ongoing trade negotiations. The next round of talks with the US is scheduled for August 25–29 in New Delhi. So far, five rounds have been held, but disagreements remain, especially over US demands for market access in agriculture, dairy, and genetically modified food, areas India says affect millions of livelihoods.The US is India’s top trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting $186 billion in 2024–25. India enjoys a goods and services trade surplus of around $44.4 billion with the US.","Us president donald trump has threatened to'substantially' raise tariffs on indian goods over its continued oil imports from russia.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday launched a sharp attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""Why is Modi afraid"" following US President Donald Trump’s remarks threatening increased tariffs on India over its continued oil trade with Russia.The party questioned PM Modi’s silence, alleging that foreign policy under the BJP government had become more about optics than national interest.Also read: 'They don't care': Trump says he will 'substantially' raise US tariff on India for buying Russian oil Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said, “So much for Howdy Modi. So much for Namaste Trump. So much for Ab ki Baar Trump Sarkar. So much for BJP MPs hailing Narendra Modi as India's trumpcard.”Jairam Ramesh added, “Despite all the hugs, all the handshakes, all the high-decibel bromance — ‘My friend Dolaand’ has delivered yet another jolt.” He questioned what came of the “much-vaunted” front-row seat at Trump’s inauguration or the prime minister being one of the first world leaders to visit the White House. “Tariffs are being slapped. Negotiations are going nowhere,” he said, also referring to Pakistan Army chief Asim Munir’s recent White House visit.“This is what happens when foreign policy becomes about image-building, not national interest,” Ramesh wrote.Also read: Trump tariff threat: No order for refiners from India to stop Russian oil imports despite US pressure, claims report Meanwhile, in a separate post on X, the Congress party directly questioned the Prime Minister, saying, “Now Narendra Modi's friend Trump has openly threatened India. Trump has said that he will impose even more tariffs on India.”“Trump claims India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia and making huge profits by selling it. India doesn’t care about those being killed in Ukraine. Trump is speaking out against India every day, and Narendra Modi is quietly listening to it all. Why is Modi so afraid of Trump?” the post read.The political row comes after Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, said India was profiting from the war in Ukraine and warned of a substantial tariff hike. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA,” Trump wrote.The statement follows earlier warnings from Trump about a 25 per cent tariff on India for its energy and defence transactions with Russia.White House deputy chief of Staff Stephen Miller echoed the sentiment in a Fox News interview, accusing India of being “basically tied with China” in oil imports from Russia. “People would be shocked... This is astonishing,” Miller said, alleging India also imposed high tariffs on US goods and had violated immigration norms.Also read: 'Not acceptable': Trump's aide accuses India of financing Russia's war; claims New Delhi tied with China in purchasing crude oil Last week, Trump criticised India’s trade policies, calling its barriers “the most strenuous and obnoxious” globally.

On Friday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said energy decisions were based on market pricing and global conditions.

NEW DELHI: Security forces have recovered a cache of arms and explosives including Chinese grenades and an IED manual from a stony cave in the Kalaroos area of Kupwara district following a joint three-day operation, officials said on Monday.The Border Security Force, Indian Army, and Jammu and Kashmir Police carried out the operation between August 2 and 4. According to a statement from BSF Kashmir, “In a 3-day joint search operation in Kalaroos, Kupwara (J&K), BSF, Army and police uncovered a stony cave on 04 Aug 2025. 12 Chinese grenades, Chinese pistol with ammunition, Kenwood radio set, Urdu IED manual and fire sticks recovered from the hideout and foiled the nefarious plan of the terrorist. ”The joint forces said the recovery points to cross-border terror support and efforts to revive militant activity in North Kashmir.In South Kashmir, operations are also underway in the Akhal Devsar area of Kulgam district for the fourth consecutive day. One terrorist has been killed so far in a firefight. On Saturday, security forces engaged in an overnight encounter with militants in the Akhal area.

Congress hits back with 'DDLJ' jibe



BJP accuses Rahul of siding with adversaries, calls him “anti-national”







Union ministers join in; BJP says Rahul owes nation an apology



Congress seeks focus on facts, not rhetoric



NEW DELHI: A stinging observation by the Supreme Court against leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi triggered a fierce war of words between the BJP and the Congress on Monday.While the BJP accused Rahul Gandhi of damaging national security and dubbed him “anti-national,” the Congress countered by accusing the Modi government of hiding facts on China, coining a pointed jibe—DDLJ: Deny, Distract, Lie and Justify.The Supreme Court, while staying a defamation case against Rahul, came down heavily on his remarks over the India-China border standoff. “How do you get to know that 2,000 sq km land was occupied by Chinese? If you are true Indian, you wouldn’t say such a thing,” the top court said. It further remarked, “You are Leader of Opposition. Say things in Parliament, why do you have to say it on social media?”The complaint against Rahul Gandhi pertained to his comment that the Chinese army was “thrashing” Indian soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh during the 2022 clash. “People will ask about Bharat Jodo Yatra... but they will not ask a single question about China capturing 2,000 sq km of Indian land, killing 20 Indian soldiers, and thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh... Don’t pretend people don’t know,” he had said.The Allahabad high court had earlier dismissed Rahul Gandhi’s plea challenging the summons, which he claimed was based on a complaint filed in bad faith.Alos read: 'True Indian won't make such statement': Supreme Court slams Rahul Gandhi over Army remark; stays defamation case The Congress, meanwhile, pushed back hard, accusing the Modi government of concealing the true extent of Chinese incursions.In a post on X, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh accused the centre of following a strategy of “DDLJ”—Deny, Distract, Lie, and Justify—to avoid answering tough questions on the Galwan clash and the broader India-China border standoff.“Since 15 June 2020, when our 20 brave soldiers were martyred in Galwan, every patriotic Indian has been grappling with some pressing questions. However, over the past five years, the Modi government has, instead of answering these questions, adopted a policy of concealing and diverting the truth,” Jairam Ramesh wrote.He then listed eight questions ranging from PM Modi’s June 19, 2020 “no intrusion” statement, to alleged loss of access to 26 patrolling points in eastern Ladakh, to the soaring trade deficit with China. Ramesh said the Modi government was now trying to “normalise relations with a country that played a significant role in supporting Pakistan’s military actions during Operation Sindoor.”Calling the government’s China policy one of “cowardice and misguided economic priorities,” Ramesh said, “The truth is that the Modi government is responsible for the greatest territorial loss India has suffered since 1962.”Meanwhile, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram recting to Supreme Court's remark said, ""I haven't read the judgment yet... Except for the government, nobody will have absolutely accurate data. We raise concerns, and it is really up to the government to verify, refute, or accept them. But to place a restriction on a member of a political party for commenting on issues of national importance, without providing any valid proof, is, in my opinion, a restriction on our democracy. ""The Supreme Court's oral remarks provided fresh ammunition to the Bharatiya Janata Party. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya posted on X, “Rahul Gandhi is now a certified anti-national.” He said, “The Supreme Court has once again reprimanded ‘China Guru’ Rahul Gandhi for making irresponsible statements concerning India’s national security and territorial integrity.”Malviya accused Rahul of undermining India’s diplomatic interests. “His recent ‘dead economy’ jibe is just the latest in a long series. In doing so, he implicitly admitted that Russia, a long-standing ally, is struggling, while bizarrely endorsing a hostile state like Pakistan as having a robust economy. A diplomatic disaster on multiple fronts,” he added.Malviya also claimed Rahul had received support from foreign powers during the 2024 election campaign and signed a secret MoU with China’s Communist Party. “During the Galwan face-off, when India was defending its sovereignty, Rahul Gandhi chose to receive a briefing from Chinese officials instead of Indian diplomats,” he alleged.He further stated that Rahul Gandhi had met individuals hostile to India during his visits abroad and amplified anti-India narratives that sought to “undermine India’s global image.”Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan criticised Rahul for allegedly demoralising the Army. “If you were a true Indian, you would never have made such statements,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court’s remarks. “Just being the leader of the opposition doesn’t mean you can say anything,” Pradhan quoted the court as saying.Pradhan added, “This is the first time in the parliamentary history of the country that the Honourable Supreme Court has had to make such stern remarks against the leader of the opposition. Rahul Gandhi and Congress have a history of insulting the army—whether it’s the surgical strike or Operation Sindoor. Their loyalty lies not with the nation but with a single family. Today, the entire country is hurt by this anti-national mindset and expects an apology. ”BJP MP Nishikant Dubey also took aim at the Congress leader. “In Parliament, one must provide evidence, but outside Parliament, it's a leather mouth — say whatever comes to mind, right or wrong. The aim is not to be the leader of the opposition but to follow the agendas of China, Pakistan, and Soros to divide the country,” Dubey said.Also read: After SC rap, BJP questions Rahul Gandhi's stand on national security: ‘Top court has sent a message, be careful' Congress MP Rajiv Shukla, responding to the row, told ANI, “This matter is subjudice.

NEW DELHI: Security agencies on Monday said they have clear proof, including Pakistani government documents, biometric data, and Karachi-made chocolates, confirming that the three terrorists killed after the Pahalgam attack were Pakistani nationals.The three were senior Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives killed in an encounter in Dachigam forest near Srinagar on July 28 during Operation Mahadev. They had been hiding there since the April 22 attack in Pahalgam’s Baisaran meadow, which claimed 26 lives. Officials confirmed that ""no local was among these terrorists"", as PTI reported.The evidence includes biometric data from Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), voter ID slips, satellite phone logs, and GPS points matching eyewitness accounts.Two Kashmiri men arrested for helping them also confirmed their role in the attack. A senior official said, ""For the first time, we have government-issued Pakistani documents in hand that nail the nationality of the Pahalgam attackers beyond doubt.""The terrorists were identified as Suleman Shah alias 'Faizal Jatt' -- ""an A++ category terrorist, mastermind and lead shooter""; Abu Hamza alias 'Afghan' -- ""an A-grade commander and the second gunman”; and Yasir alias 'Jibran' -- “also an A-grade commander and the third gunman."" From Shah and Hamza’s pockets, forces recovered laminated voter slips issued by Pakistan’s Election Commission, linked to electoral rolls in Lahore (NA-125) and Gujranwala (NA-79).A damaged satellite phone’s micro-SD card contained NADRA biometric records -- fingerprints, facial templates, and family trees, confirming their citizenship and home addresses in Changa Manga (Kasur district) and Koiyan village near Rawalakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Other items included wrappers of 'CandyLand' and 'ChocoMax' chocolates, traced to a May 2024 consignment shipped to Muzaffarabad, PoK. Forensic tests confirmed that AK-103 rifles seized from them were the same weapons used in the attack, and DNA from Pahalgam matched the bodies.Officials said the terrorists crossed the Line of Control via north Kashmir’s Gurez sector in May 2022. Two helpers, Parvaiz and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, sheltered them overnight before they trekked to Baisaran to carry out the attack. GPS data from a seized device matched firing positions described by eyewitnesses.Satellite phone records showed nightly contact with handlers in Pakistan.

Were you there on the border?

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi , the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, got a rap on his knuckles on Monday from the Supreme Court for his 2022 statement - Chinese are ""thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh"" - while criticising the government for its handling of the Galwan Valley clash at the LAC. ""If you were a true Indian, you would not say all this,"" the apex court told him.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih lambasted Rahul for making allegations that China captured 2,000 sq km of Indian territory and asked him whether he was present there. It made it clear to him that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Gandhi, defended him saying, ""if he cannot say these things which are published in the Press, he cannot be a leader of opposition"". However, he agreed that the statement could have been worded better.SC's censure came during the hearing on Rahul's plea for staying a defamation case filed against him over his claim about Indian jawans having been walloped by the Chinese during the Galwan standoff. After the hearing, the court stayed the defamation proceedings against him but not before giving him an earful.""Tell, Dr Singhvi, how do you get to know that 2,000 sq km of Indian territory was occupied by the Chinese? Were you there? Do you have any credible material? Why do you make these statements without any...Ifyou were a true Indian, you would not say all this if there is a conflict at the border,"" the bench said.The senior advocate responded by saying that it was also possible that a true Indian would say that 20 Indian soldiers were beaten up and killed as it was a matter of concern for the country.Singhvi argued that while some people may not agree with the statement, it was not prohibited under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which pertains to the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He underscored that public interest was involved in the issue and it would be unfortunate if a leader of opposition could not raise and highlight such an issue.“Whatever you have to say, why don’t you say it in Parliament? Why do you have to say this in social media posts?” the bench asked.Challenging the defamation case proceedings, Singhvi said it was done to harass Rahul, and he also pointed out that the trial court did not follow section 223 of BNSS which said prior hearing of the accused was mandatory before taking cognisance of a criminal complaint. The court, thereafter, issued notice on Rahul’s plea and stayed the proceeding in the case, despite senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia, appearing for the complainant, opposing the stay order. The bench asked him to file a response.Rahul moved SC after the Allahabad high court on May 29 rejected his plea for quashing of summoning order passed in Feb by a court in Lucknow. The HC observed that freedom of speech and expression did not include the freedom to make statements which defame the Indian Army. The complaint was filed by former Border Roads Organisation (BRO) director Uday Shankar Srivastava against Rahul for making the allegedly derogatory remarks in Dec 2022 during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.“People will ask about Bharat Jodo Yatra, here and there, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot and what-not. But they will not ask a single question about China capturing 2,000 sqkm of Indian territory, killing 20 Indian soldiers and thrashing our soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh. But the Indian Press doesn’t ask a question to them about this. Isn’t it true? The nation is watching all this. Don’t pretend that people don’t know,” Rahul had said at a press conference during the yatra.","Supreme court tells rahul gandhi that as leader of opposition he cannot go on saying whatever he wants.

MEA: Nations slamming India themselves trading with Russia

In its first direct public pushback against US President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of India over trade with Russia, the Centre termed his criticism ""unjustified and unreasonable"". It said like any major economy, New Delhi will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.In an official statement, ministry of external affairs said the US itself continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for its EV industry and fertilisers as well as chemicals from Russia.The response, a rare outpouring of frustration with Trump's rants, followed another outburst by the US president in which he accused India of buying massive amounts of Russian Oil and selling it in the open market for big profits, while threatening to substantially raise tariffs on imports from India.MEA added that India's imports are meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to Indian consumers and are a necessity compelled by global market situation. ""...It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are...indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia.Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.The official also recalled that the US had in 2022 encouraged Indian imports from Russia as it helped stabilise the global energy market.Trump’s blunt and open threat, which came on top of the 25% tariffs and unquantified penalty he has already announced last week, did not specify if there would be more or higher tariffs than he has already rolled out. But what seems certain is that he is angered by India’s obduracy in not concluding a trade deal on his terms and its insistence on continuing to buy discounted Russian oil.In a message he posted on his “Truth Social” platform, Trump also accused India of not caring “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine”. Trump surrogates have alleged that India and China are virtually bankrolling the war because they are among the world’s top two oil importers, and revenue from hydrocarbons is what is funding the Russian military.The charge that New Delhi is re-selling Russian oil for profit appears to be a distortion, twisting India’s large refining capacity that makes Russian oil suitable for export, including to Europe.Trump is also irked by India’s repudiation of his repeated claim that he used the bait of trade to stop the India-Pakistan war, a claim he has made nearly 30 times in several fora. Unable to end the Russia-Ukraine war on “Day One” of his presidency as he had pledged, Trump is talking up his claimed role in the India-Pakistan cessation of hostilities in a transparent bid for a Nobel Prize, including gratuitously canvassing for it with anyone who listens.The extraordinary threat by the US president, who has weaponised tariffs for a range of objectives from gouging trade deals from poor and vulnerable nations to trying to bring about regime change (like in Brazil) to dismantling groups like Brics, which he sees as a threat to the US and the primacy of its currency, is unprecedented in history.Combined with Trump’s sudden love for Pakistan, ostensibly for its glib backing for a Nobel Prize for him, it evokes among some commentators memories of Washington’s infamous 1970’s “tilt” during the Nixon administration, when the US tried to bully New Delhi during the Bangladesh Liberation War by sending the US Seventh Fleet to the Bay of Bengal with the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise.While a much weaker India refused to be browbeaten by the Nixon-Kissinger threat at that time, New Delhi appears to be in as defiant a mood in the face of Trump’s belligerence, potentially risking what some experts have said could be a 2% blow to its GDP growth (currently clocking around 6.5%), but which some govt surrogates say could be as low as 0.2%.“India has been targeted by the US and the European Union for importing oil from Russia after the commencement of the Ukraine conflict. In fact, India began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict. The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability,” said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Such reactions by India were limited earlier to calls by the Europeans to shun trade with Russia. The ministry also said that the EU in 2024 had a bilateral trade of Euro 67.5 billion in goods with Russia. In addition, it had trade in services estimated at Euro 17.2 billion in 2023. This, added the official, is significantly more than India’s total trade with Russia that year or subsequently.“European imports of LNG in 2024, in fact, reached a record 16.5m tonnes, surpassing the last record of 15.2m tonnes in 2022,” Jaiswal said, adding that Europe-Russia trade includes not just energy, but also fertilizers, mining products, chemicals, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment.","Nations slamming india are themselves trading with russia, says mea.

NEW DELHI: Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday said the Indian armed forces are fully prepared to handle fifth-generation warfare marked by non-contact combat, strategic tempo and psychological dominance, emphasising that the nature of modern warfare demands integration of conventional power with emerging technologies.Speaking at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, Gen Dwivedi described future battlefields as ones “where boots must share space with bots.”He was addressing a session on ‘ Operation Sindoor – A New Chapter in India’s Fight Against Terrorism’, and used the occasion to highlight India’s evolving military doctrine and readiness.Describing Operation Sindoor as a turning point, Gen Dwivedi said it was an “intelligence-driven response that redefined India’s counter-terrorism doctrine.”As per news agency PTI, he stated that the 88-hour tri-services operation was “unprecedented in scale, range, depth and strategic impact,” compelling Pakistan to seek a ceasefire within that window. He said it was executed across the DIME spectrum, referring to diplomatic, informational, military and economic efforts.During his two-day visit to Chennai, the army chief also inaugurated ‘Agnishodh’, a dedicated Indian Army Research Cell at IIT-Madras to promote indigenous defence innovations.As per a press release, this initiative forms part of the Army’s ‘Five Pillars of Transformation’, particularly focusing on modernisation and technology infusion.Gen Dwivedi underscored the military’s commitment to self-reliance through collaborations under national technology missions like ‘INDIAai’, ‘Chip-to-Startup’, and ‘Project QuILA’, with Military College of Telecommunication Engineering (MCTE), Mhow, as a strategic partner.According to PTI, he also appreciated innovation-led efforts of Indian Army cells at institutions such as IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur and IISc-Bengaluru. He noted that programmes like Project SAMBHAV and additive manufacturing partnerships with Army Base Workshops are “setting new benchmarks” in applied defence technology.Calling the IIT-Madras collaboration a landmark step, he said ‘Agnishodh’ would convert academic excellence into battlefield innovation and bolster the goal of ‘Viksit Bharat by 2047’.During the event, the Army Chief also honoured four decorated ex-servicemen with Veteran Achievers Awards, recognising their service and continued contributions to nation-building, the official statement added.","Army chief general upendra dwivedi on monday said the indian armed forces are fully prepared to handle fifth-generation warfare.

Jerry Jones stays silent as buzz builds

Former Dallas Cowboys star Dez Bryant ignited a social media frenzy Sunday with a mysterious tweet aimed at Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Bryant warned Jones not to mention his name and teased sharing “wild cowboy stories,” adding a surprising mention of global rap superstar Nicki Minaj . The unexpected reference sent fans from both NFL and music worlds buzzing, eager to learn more.Bryant’s tense history with Jones dates back to his controversial 2018 exit from the Cowboys. Over the weekend, Bryant took to Twitter/X cautioning Jones: “It’s not smart to mention my name.” He then added, “I could give some wild cowboy stories…I’m thinking about @NICKIMINAJ 🤔.” This rare mention of Minaj, who has no known ties to the Cowboys, sparked intense speculation but remains unconfirmed.Though Nicki Minaj has no official connection to Dallas football, she playfully engaged with Bryant’s post on social media. In a direct response, she said, “Hey, it’s Nicki Minaj. How about we play a game? Every time you do a ‘Jerry Jones’ or ‘NFL’ story time, I’ll do a ‘story time’ of my own.” This back-and-forth amplified excitement among fans, blending NFL drama with pop culture intrigue.Social media erupted as followers urged Bryant to reveal what he hinted at. Some believe he’s stirring up attention, while others await potential bombshells involving Cowboys history and unexpected celebrity ties.As one user named @PushingThirty sarcastically put it, ""Do you got a line to snort?"" @Chris Sterling commented: ""Wtf is this Nicki Minaj x Dez Bryant crossever I'm stumbled upon in 2025???"" perfectly capturing the internet's reaction. However, no verified information has emerged to confirm any direct involvement of Minaj in Cowboys affairs.Jerry Jones has not publicly responded to Bryant’s latest comments. Known for navigating controversies throughout his tenure, Jones’s silence adds to anticipation. Whether Bryant’s hints lead to concrete revelations or remain playful teases is yet to be seen.For now, Bryant’s tweet remains a tantalizing mystery mixing fact with speculation.

Social media goes wild as Barbz and NFL fans pick sides



What started as an NFL drama turned into a wild Twitter war involving Dez Bryant, Nicki Minaj , and Roc Nation’s deepest secrets. Dez Bryant wanted to call out Jerry Jones. What he didn’t expect? Getting caught in the lyrical crossfire of Nicki Minaj and the Barbz war machine. What began as a Cowboys front office spat over Roc Nation suddenly spiraled into one of the messiest celebrity feuds of the year, complete with shade, scandal, and a $10 million fight challenge. Yes, seriously.Nicki jumped in with accusations about Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, Dez clapped back, and the timeline hasn’t been the same since. So if you're confused why an NFL legend is beefing with the Queen of Rap, here’s the full messy breakdown.It all kicked off when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones brought up Dez Bryant while discussing Micah Parsons' contract situation. Jones implied Roc Nation ghosted him back in the day while negotiating Dez’s 2015 deal. Dez didn’t take it lightly.He fired back on X (formerly Twitter):“JERRY JONES I DON’T THINK IT’S SMART TO MENTION MY NAME… WE CAN HAVE STORY TIME IF THAT’S WHAT WE ARE DOING.”For those keeping score: Bryant was once repped by Roc Nation, but he says the part about them going silent is completely false.And just when we thought this was going to be another basic NFL beef, Nicki entered the chat.Out of nowhere, Nicki Minaj dropped a tweet that lit the fuse:Then came the kicker:Nicki has a long-running issue with Roc Nation and its leadership especially Desiree Perez. But now, she’s essentially threatening to expose everything if Dez keeps going. He may have been talking NFL business, but she made it deeply personal.After Nicki’s first wave of tweets, Dez tried softening the situation:He even said he was a fan and didn’t want any problems. But Nicki wasn’t in the mood for peace. She responded with receipts, dragging up Dez’s past like the 2012 domestic violence case involving his mother and doubled down on Roc Nation drama.Then came the bombshell:Nicki offered Dez $10 million to fight her husband, Kenneth Petty.Dez? He went full savage mode:And just like that, this wasn’t about football anymore. It became one of the most explosive pop culture feuds of 2025.You know how this goes, once Nicki and Dez started throwing punches (figuratively… for now), fans turned Twitter into a war zone. The Barbz army flooded Dez’s replies with memes, clapbacks, and accusations. NFL fans were torn, some backing Dez, others begging him to log off before it got worse and with Nicki hinting that she’s just getting started, the internet is basically sitting back with popcorn.Also read - Dez Bryant threatens to expose “unfair sh*t” after Jerry Jones name-drops him over Micah Parsons",Dez bryant wanted to call out jerry jones.

Pittsburgh Penguins connection puts Toronto Maple Leafs' Nick Robertson firmly on NHL trade radar

“He’s a guy people are watching closely. There’s interest, it just depends on fit and what Toronto is looking for in return,”

Columbus Blue Jackets trade idea gains traction, but deal needs more from Toronto Maple Leafs to move Nick Robertson

Despite avoiding arbitration and signing a fresh one-year, $1.825 million contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Nick Robertson’s name remains in the NHL trade rumor mill. As per Elliotte Friedman on the, both the Pittsburgh Penguins and Columbus Blue Jackets are keeping tabs on the 23-year-old winger, whose future in Toronto remains uncertain due to the team’s crowded forward group, ongoing cap challenges, and questions surrounding his long-term role and development within the organization’s current competitive window.Friedman highlighted the Pittsburgh Penguins as a logical suitor for Robertson, mainly due to team president Kyle Dubas, formerly Toronto’s GM and the executive who originally drafted Robertson in 2019. While Robertson is signed for the upcoming season, Friedman noted that Toronto is still looking to make at least one more move to address its cap situation and forward surplus.Friedman said.Given Pittsburgh’s need to inject youth into its aging roster and Dubas’s familiarity with Robertson’s upside, a deal could make sense for both sides, especially if Toronto seeks depth or defensive reinforcement in return.Robertson has also been loosely linked to the Columbus Blue Jackets, with fans and insiders suggesting a possible one-for-one swap involving winger Yegor Chinakhov. While Chinakhov has requested a trade and possesses top-six potential, Friedman noted the Leafs would likely need to sweeten the deal, as a straight swap doesn’t currently interest Columbus.Chinakhov, 23, scored seven goals in 30 games last season and remains a developing asset. Friedman emphasized that Leafs GM Brad Treliving is actively exploring trade possibilities and may look for a more balanced return if Robertson is moved.Adding intrigue, Toronto remains linked to unsigned free agent Jack Roslovic, who coincidentally finished last season with Columbus and is drawing interest from at least five NHL teams. While unrelated directly to Robertson, any forward addition would further crowd Toronto’s depth chart.Whether it's the Penguins or Blue Jackets, Nick Robertson’s situation with the Toronto Maple Leafs is far from settled. With trade buzz intensifying and roster changes still likely, the winger’s future will be one to monitor closely as the 2025–26 season approaches.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs re-sign Nicholas Robertson to one-year, $1.825M contract to avoid arbitration","Nick robertson avoided arbitration and signed a fresh one-year, $1.825 million contract with the toronto maple leafs.

“Living Nostradamus” or Athos Salomé, popularly known, has sparked global debate with a controversial prediction about US President Joe Biden. Salomé claims that Biden could face a sudden and serious medical emergency between September and November 2025, or by 2026 at the latest. He warns that such a health crisis could have profound effects on international trust, political stability, and global alliances. The prediction comes at a sensitive time, as Biden is already undergoing treatment for aggressive prostate cancer, a diagnosis that has raised public concerns about his health and leadership capability. With an upcoming election cycle and heightened geopolitical tensions, the forecast has intensified discussions on how Biden’s health could influence world politics.Salomé’s forecast suggests Biden could suffer from a serious medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalisation as reported by. He speculates possible issues involving bone complications or even a heart attack, both of which could trigger intense media coverage and influence global diplomatic relations. While Salomé is known for making high-profile predictions, critics argue that such claims lack scientific credibility and risk creating unnecessary panic.Earlier this year, Biden revealed that he has an aggressive form of prostate cancer, rated Gleason 9, indicating one of the most severe cases. Despite this, he opted for a less invasive treatment plan rather than surgery or chemotherapy. Biden reassured the public that the cancer has not spread to his bones or organs. He continues to take a daily oral medication and has expressed optimism about overcoming the disease, telling reporters, “We expect to be able to beat this. ”Salomé’s prediction is not limited to Biden’s personal health—it touches on global political stability. An unexpected hospitalization of a sitting US president could shake international confidence, affect market stability, and raise questions about US leadership capacity during a critical geopolitical period. With an election cycle approaching, concerns about Biden’s age and health are already prominent, and any health emergency would likely intensify political debates.The White House has not commented directly on Salomé’s predictions but maintains that President Biden remains fully active in his presidential duties while adhering to his treatment protocols. Political analysts caution against drawing conclusions from mystical forecasts but acknowledge that Biden’s health remains a legitimate point of public discussion, especially as he continues to lead one of the world’s most powerful nations.Athos Salomé is a Brazilian mystic often compared to the historic Nostradamus because of his unusual and sometimes accurate predictions regarding global events. Despite having no scientific basis, his forecasts attract significant media attention. His past claims about world leaders and major incidents have made him a controversial figure, admired by followers yet dismissed by skeptics as spreading alarmist narratives.Salomé claimed Biden could face a sudden medical emergency between September and November 2025 or by 2026.No. Biden confirmed his bones and organs are unaffected, and his doctors remain optimistic about recovery.Yes, a sudden medical crisis could impact US leadership stability and international trust, especially before elections.He speculated issues like bone complications or even a heart attack requiring immediate hospitalisation.His previous forecasts about global events have attracted media buzz, even though they lack scientific backing.No concrete evidence exists; experts consider it speculative and caution against alarmism.","Athos salomé, popularly known as living nostradamus, has sparked global debate with a controversial prediction about us president joe biden.

Tony Buzbee defends his reputation amid accusations of racial bias

Marine Corps bond reportedly helped close the case quietly

NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe continues to face public scrutiny after the shocking lawsuit filed against him earlier this year by 19-year-old Gabriella Zuniga. As the dust settles from a quiet $50 million settlement, the spotlight now turns to the attorney representing Zuniga—Tony Buzbee—who’s firing back after being accused of racially targeting high-profile Black men.Attorney Tony Buzbee, known for representing multiple women in the Deshaun Watson misconduct case, has strongly pushed back against Sharpe’s claim that he deliberately goes after Black men. In a candid interview with Esquire, Buzbee made it clear: “He has no relevance in my life. I actually think he’s very entertaining when he yells and screams and talks about sports that he’s not involved in. But if I think it’s a legitimate case, then I pursue it. And I think this is worth my time.”Buzbee, who previously filed lawsuits involving Jay-Z and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, now finds himself under fire for what critics see as a pattern. However, the Houston-based attorney insists his pursuit of justice is based on merit, not race. His comments come after Sharpe was accused by Gabriella Zuniga of rape, emotional abuse, and coercive behavior during their brief relationship in 2023.Zuniga, a former OnlyFans model, alleged she was subjected to public humiliation and non-consensual acts—claims that made headlines in April when the lawsuit was officially filed in Nevada.Despite the public tension, Sharpe’s attorney Michael Marino revealed a surprising twist in the resolution. “Like many highly successful individuals, Tony Buzbee is a complex and formidable figure,” Marino said. “Our shared experience as former officers in the United States Marine Corps fostered a mutual respect... That brotherhood enabled us to speak candidly and constructively.”That connection led to a private settlement in July, one that has now prompted professional consequences. Sharpe was quietly let go from ESPN following the scandal, though he continues to remain a vocal presence through his popular podcasts Club Shay Shay and Nightcap.Also Read: “She just wants attention”: Simone Biles faces unexpected NFL backlash as feud with Riley Gaines fuels fan criticism","Shannon sharpe's sexual assault accuser's lawyer denies racial targeting.

Japan, a country known for its incredible life expectancy and vibrant elderly community, has celebrated yet another milestone in longevity. Shigeko Kagawa, a 114-year-old retired physician from Nara Prefecture, has officially been recognised as Japan’s oldest living person, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.This honour comes after the passing of Miyoko Hiroyasu, also aged 114, who previously held the title. Kagawa’s life, spanning more than a century, reflects Japan’s rich cultural heritage, advancements in healthcare, and the unique lifestyle choices often linked with exceptional longevity.Born in the early 20th century, Shigeko Kagawa’s life began in a very different Japan. She pursued higher education at a time when opportunities for women, particularly in medicine, were rare and challenging. Kagawa graduated from medical school before World War II, making her part of an early wave of women who broke gender barriers in healthcare.Her initial medical work was conducted in Osaka during wartime, a period marked by limited resources, societal upheaval, and urgent medical needs. She later returned to her hometown, where she took over her family’s clinic, serving as an obstetrician and gynecologist. Her work focused on women’s health, maternal care, and childbirth, areas that were vital for post-war recovery in Japanese society.Kagawa continued practicing medicine until the age of 86, demonstrating not only her professional dedication but also her remarkable physical and mental resilience.Even after retirement, Shigeko Kagawa’s life continued to inspire. In 2021, when the world was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, she became one of the oldest Olympic torchbearers in history. Participating in the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Torch Relay at the age of 109 made headlines worldwide, symbolizing hope, perseverance, and the enduring spirit of the elderly community.Her appearance wasn’t just ceremonial—it carried a powerful message: age does not define one’s ability to contribute, inspire, and celebrate life. For many, Kagawa became a living example of Japan’s “ikigai” philosophy, which emphasizes having a purpose and joy in everyday life as a secret to longevity.When asked about her secret to longevity in a 2023 interview with TOS News, Shigeko Kagawa’s response was simple yet profound:“I don’t have any. I just play every day. My energy is my greatest asset. I go where I want, eat what I want, and do what I want. I’m free and independent.”Her lifestyle emphasises freedom, independence, and a playful approach to daily living. Unlike rigid dietary regimens or structured fitness programs often associated with longevity, Kagawa attributes her long life to mental well-being, active living, and personal happiness.These traits are common among centenarians, particularly in Japan, where psychological wellness and social connections often play as big a role as physical health in extending life expectancy.Shigeko Kagawa’s recognition as Japan’s oldest living person follows the death of Miyoko Hiroyasu, who had also lived to the remarkable age of 114. Hiroyasu, born in 1911, lived a life filled with creativity and education. She studied art in Tokyo, worked as a teacher in Hiroshima Prefecture, and raised three children.Her later years were spent in a nursing home in Oita Prefecture, where she enjoyed reading newspapers, sketching, and playing card games—activities that kept her mind active and engaged. On her 113th birthday, she expressed gratitude for her health and longevity, saying: “I am grateful to be healthy.”Hiroyasu’s life story, much like Kagawa’s, reflects the value of staying mentally and socially active, traits commonly linked with Japan’s exceptional number of centenarians.Japan holds a global record for life expectancy, with women often outliving men by several years. As of 1 September 2024, the country had 36 million people aged 65 or older, making up 29% of the total population—the highest proportion of elderly citizens in the world. Even more striking is the fact that 10% of Japan’s population is now aged 80 and above, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. This demographic trend has profound implications for healthcare, social support, and economic planning.While longevity is often celebrated, it also presents challenges. A rapidly aging population increases demand for elder care, medical infrastructure, and pension systems. Policymakers are focusing on innovative solutions, such as robotics for elderly care, community-based support programs, and promoting healthy aging through technology and wellness education.At the same time, people like Shigeko Kagawa provide valuable insight into how to live a long, fulfilling life without rigid rules or extreme lifestyle changes. Her story resonates with younger generations who are increasingly seeking work-life balance, mental well-being, and personal freedom.Japan’s unusually high number of centenarians—individuals aged 100 and older—has long fascinated researchers and policymakers. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon:Japanese cuisine emphasizes fresh vegetables, fish, rice, seaweed, and fermented foods, all of which promote heart health and digestion. The traditional diet is low in processed sugars and saturated fats, reducing the risk of chronic diseases.Many elderly Japanese remain physically active through simple routines like walking, gardening, or even participating in community events, just as Kagawa did with the Olympic torch relay.Loneliness has been linked to reduced life expectancy globally, but Japan’s elderly often benefit from tight-knit communities, cultural respect for seniors, and strong family bonds.Japan’s universal healthcare system provides affordable medical access, ensuring early detection and treatment of diseases that might otherwise shorten life expectancy.The Japanese concept of “ikigai”, meaning a reason to live or purpose in life, is often cited as a key to longevity. People like Kagawa embody this philosophy by maintaining independence, enjoying simple pleasures, and staying engaged in meaningful activities.","Shigeko kagawa, a 114-year-old retired physician from nara prefecture, has officially been recognised as japan’s oldest living person.

Billionaire Vinod Khosla says “College degrees are dead” as AI will disrupt education and replace expert jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/billionaire-vinod-khosla-says-college-degrees-are-dead-as-ai-will-disrupt-education-and-replace-expert-jobs/articleshow/123094534.cms,"



Vinod Khosla predicts AI tutors will surpass human educators

“College degrees are dead”: End of credentialism

Democratizing access to education and expertise

CK-12 and the future of adaptive education

Wider impact: Job disruption and new opportunities

In a bold prediction that challenges the foundations of modern education and white-collar work, billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla has declared that traditional college degrees are becoming obsolete. Speaking in recent interviews and forums, Khosla argued that artificial intelligence will soon outpace elite human educators and professionals, ushering in a future where personalised, AI-driven learning replaces expensive universities—and expert jobs in law, finance, and healthcare are increasingly handled by machines. His vision portrays a near-future where curiosity, adaptability, and access to AI matter more than credentials.Khosla believes that AI tutoring systems will soon outperform even the most highly paid private teachers. These systems will offer continuous, personalized learning tailored to each student’s pace and style. In his view, a child in a remote village could soon receive better instruction from an AI tutor than a child at an elite school in a global city. He predicts that within five years, every student could access a free AI tutor, leading to a radical transformation in how we think about learning and its cost.According to Khosla, the dominance of college degrees and academic credentials is nearing its end. He argues that AI systems providing real-time, updated knowledge will erode the need for time-bound degrees and institutional validation. Skills will matter more than diplomas, and success will increasingly be measured by one’s ability to learn and adapt—not by a framed certificate. In this new landscape, curiosity-driven education will replace rigid curricula, empowering learners to switch disciplines without enrolling in long, expensive degree programs.A major emphasis of Khosla’s vision is accessibility. AI will remove geographical and economic barriers to education and professional guidance. From legal advice to financial planning and medical diagnostics, AI could deliver expert-level services to anyone with a smartphone. He suggests this could ease the burden on overworked courts, make quality healthcare accessible to rural areas, and allow even low-income individuals to receive reliable financial advice—unlocking upward mobility at scale.Khosla predicts that AI will deeply reshape white-collar professions. In law, AI could reduce case backlogs by offering free or low-cost legal support. In finance, smart algorithms will deliver tailored investment and savings strategies, even to people earning modest incomes. And in healthcare, he sees AI providing diagnostic support and treatment recommendations, democratizing what was once the preserve of elite specialists. Over the next 25 years, he believes many of these services could be available nearly for free.Highlighting existing examples, Khosla often points to CK-12, the nonprofit education platform co-founded by his wife Neeru Khosla, as a model of how AI-powered, adaptive learning can reach millions. Unlike traditional textbooks or courses, CK-12 tailors content based on student performance, offering a glimpse into how future AI tutors might work—scalable, personalized, and accessible to all, regardless of income or location.While Khosla acknowledges that AI may replace up to 80% of current jobs in the coming years, he also sees this shift as an opportunity. As specialized tasks become automated, the most valuable human skillsets will be generalist in nature: critical thinking, creativity, communication, and adaptability. He urges educators and policymakers to prepare for a world where lifelong learning, not career-long credentialism, is the norm.Vinod Khosla’s forecast is not merely about technology—it’s about a fundamental redistribution of opportunity. As AI breaks down traditional barriers to knowledge and professional advice, the gatekeepers of education and expertise lose their monopoly. The result, according to Khosla, will be a more equitable society—if people and institutions are willing to adapt. In his words, “This is not an improvement of the old system—it’s the end of the old system.”","Billionaire venture capitalist vinod khosla has declared that traditional college degrees are becoming obsolete.
