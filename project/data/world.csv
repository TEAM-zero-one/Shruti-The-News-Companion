The proposed amendments focus on enhancing the administration and ensuring more effective management of Waqf assets across India.

Overcome the shortcomings of the previous act and enhance the efficiency of Waqf boards by introducing changes such as renaming the Act

Updating the definitions of Waqf Improving the registration process

Increasing the role of technology in managing Waqf records

NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Tuesday rejected Pakistani despensation's remark on new Waqf law as ""baseleass and motivated"".The ministry of external affairs said Islamabad had ""no locus standi to comment on a matter"" and that the Pakistani government should look into its own abysmal record.""We strongly reject the motivated and baseless comments made by Pakistan on the Waqf Amendment Act enacted by the Parliament of India. Pakistan has no locus standi to comment on a matter that is internal to India. Pakistan would do better to look at its own abysmal record when it comes to protecting the rights of minorities, instead of preaching to others,"" said external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Earlier, the Pakistani government had called the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 in the Indian Lok Sabha an act to ""dispossess Muslims from their properties, including mosques and shrines and marginalise the minorities"".The Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 aims to modify the Waqf Act, 1995, to address challenges in the regulation and oversight of Waqf properties.Alongside this legislation, Parliament also approved the Mussalman Wakf (Repeal) Bill, 2025, which repeals the century-old Mussalman Wakf Act of 1923, aiming to eliminate outdated provisions.","Pakistani government had called the waqf (amendment) bill 2025 an act to ""dispossess muslims from their properties, including mosques and shrines and marginalise the minorities"" the indian government on tuesday rejected pakistani despensation's remark as ""baseleass and motivated""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120317254,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1366952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"As US-China ties crash and burn, eyes turn towards India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-us-china-ties-crash-and-burn-eyes-turn-towards-india-tariff-trade-war/articleshow/120316772.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US-China ties are headed for a devastating crash with attention in America now pivoting towards New Delhi to assess if India can -- or will -- step into the breach.More signs of the US-China flame-out emerged on Tuesday after Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of Boeing aircraft. China is Boeing's biggest customer with projections by the company of delivering nearly 9,000 planes to China — about 20% of the total — over the next two decades. By contrast, India is expected to order around 2400 Boeing aircraft till 2043.Also read: China plays rare earth card as US, India dig deep The Chinese directive also included halting orders of aircraft-related equipment and parts, indicating it is ready to suffer pain and disruption to crank up domestic aircraft manufacturing by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which has been ramping up to take on Boeing and Airbus, the two global aircraft majors.Beijing's blow to Boeing in response to President Trump's tariff gambit came amid growing apprehension in the American commentariat that the MAGA supremo may have overplayed his hand in trying to paint China into a corner -- without rallying support from the rest of the world. There is dismay that on the contrary he has alienated almost the entire world, including European allies.A viral meme showing Trump saying ""I hold the cards"" and Xi responding with ""The cards are made in China"" provided an apt metaphor for the tariff fallout, with many experts saying although both countries will feel the pain from the spat that has inflamed the world, Beijing appears to have more leverage than the Trump White House anticipated, not to speak of greater resilience and endurance to ride out the punishment.US analysts are increasingly looking at India as a potential winner in the trade war expecting New Delhi to take advantage of the tariff differential. ""Is India ready to step in for China?"" the NYT asked in a front page story that said while Trump’s trade war with Beijing could be good for New Delhi, the country's dreams of becoming a new factory to the world is beset with familiar problems -- lack of skilled workers, supply chain issues, infrastructure shortcomings and red tape.But MAGA hardliners, despite being mocked for expecting low-end, assembly-line manufacturing to return to the US, bristle at the idea of depending on India for items like pharmaceuticals after extricating itself from China's dominance. The argument has caused the US President to go back and forth on taxing pharma imports, first holding back on tariffs and later indicating he will review it.In fact, the MAGA Supremo's back-and-forth on the tariff issue on some sectors, including automobiles in the latest instances, has led to allegations of crony capitalism and insider trading as the United States appears to be in far greater turmoil than China and rest of the world after igniting a global trade conflagration.A defensive President Trump pushed back on Monday, asserting that he does not change his mind but he is a ""very flexible person."" Following signs that he's carve out another tariff exception to help the US auto sector, the country's $ 42 billion toy industry, which is heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing and supplies, is also clamoring for a break arguing that toys are critical for child development.Many liberal pundits are now surmising that instead of running rings around China as the White House mandarins are suggesting the US President is doing, it is Trump who is running around in circles. Amid growing concerns about the Chinese President Xi's high-profile visits to Vietnam and Malaysia, US experts are wondering if Trump has unwittingly ceded global primacy to Beijing.""What if you get into a trade war with China and you lose? What if, after infuriating the rest of the world, putting tariffs on them, too, you make China look stronger, more reliable, more farsighted, more strategic in the eyes of all these other countries that are now looking for an exit from the unreliable consequences of US hegemony?"" the liberal podcaster Ezra Klein asked amid growing self-doubt across US business circles.But Trump made light of the Chinese leader's purported inroads in East Asia, saying he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam for engaging while seeming to hold out an olive branch to Xi. ""I like him. He likes me. I mean, you know, who knows?” Trump said as Chinese interlocutors continued to taunt the US with a flood of memes, cartoons, and videos. One meme showed Xi holding a pair of aces and Trump holding a two and a seven, about the weakest hand in cards.The distrust engendered by Trump's trade, tariff assault, and geo-political assault on the world, including on allies, is so great that the European Commission is reported to have issued burner phones and basic laptops to some US-bound staff to avoid the risk of espionage in Washington, where they are headed to for the World Bank/IMF meetings, according to the Financial Times. The caution is traditionally reserved for trips to China.","Beijing directed its airlines to stop taking delivery of boeing aircraft.

By contrast, india is expected to order around 2400 boeing aircraft till 2043.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120316958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-999724,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

I wish I could say Pakistan has changed. They unfortunately, in many ways, are continuing their bad habits. I would say the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack was the turning point. I think that was when the Indian public, across political parties, said this is too much.”""People felt that the country (India) cannot accept this behaviour from a neighbour. I think that feeling was very very strong in society, but it may not have been entirely understood at that time by the Government at that time, which is a different matter,"" he added.“Pakistan played a double game in Afghanistan. On one hand, it was ostensibly supporting the Americans and on the other, it was supporting the Taliban,” Jaishankar said during an interactive session with students at Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) in Anand, Gujarat.He further added, “The terrorism industry promoted by Pakistan eventually came back to bite it.”Addressing the students, Jaishankar linked national progress to academic excellence. “As someone who has lived in eight countries and travelled to more than 100 countries… when we talk about any nation rising, the one metric of judging a nation is the state of its universities. You cannot be a great nation if your universities are not great,” he said.","The 2008 mumbai terror attacks had been a major turning point in india-pakistan relations. “pakistan played a double game in afghanistan.

2008 Mumbai Terror Attacks Plotter Tahawwur Rana Extradited To India To Face Trial | Watch

NEW DELHI: 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana is currently being interrogated daily for up to ten hours by National Investigation Agency (NIA) over his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks , news agency PTI reported citing sources. Rana arrived in New Delhi on Thursday following his extradition from the United States.The NIA aims to uncover a wider conspiracy behind the attacks, which killed 166 people and injured over 230.Rana is being held in a high-security cell at the NIA headquarters in Delhi's CGO Complex. According to PTI sources, he has been cooperating with investigators led by Chief Investigating Officer Jaya Roy. So far, Rana has requested a pen, some paper or a notepad, and a Quran—all of which have been provided.He has raised no special food demands and is being given standard meals as per protocol.As per PTI sources, the 64-year-old Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman, is being held in a high-security cell at the anti-terror agency’s CGO Complex office. He is under constant guard and is being interrogated based on evidence collected during the agency's investigation, including a large number of phone calls with co-conspirator David Coleman Headley.The Delhi court granted the NIA 18 days of custody, stressing the gravity of the charges and the national security threat they pose. The court also directed medical check-ups every 48 hours and permitted Rana to meet his lawyer, following due legal process and the conditions outlined in the extradition agreement.Rana faces multiple charges including conspiracy to commit murder, waging war against India, and planning terrorist acts under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). These charges stem from his alleged involvement with David Coleman Headley, a key figure in the Mumbai attacks who is currently imprisoned in the US.The NIA believes Rana may provide crucial information about reconnaissance visits to various Indian cities before the 2008 attacks and about his communication with operatives of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. Investigators are also examining potential links between Rana and senior figures in terror outfits such as LeT and Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (HuJI), along with suspected involvement of Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI officers.The court said that the case has international dimensions, with multiple Indian cities identified as potential targets. It also pointed out the need to confront Rana with key witnesses, documents, and forensic evidence.","Tahawwur rana arrived in new delhi on thursday following his extradition from the united states.

Dana White reacts to the viral kiss cam moment that fans can’t stop talking about

Ice Spice's fans express disappointment while others defend the Jets star



The spotlight may be shining on rapper Ice Spice and NFL cornerback Sauce Gardner , but it wasn’t the kind of attention fans expected. The rumored couple recently attended a UFC event together, only to find themselves in a cringe-worthy moment when the kiss cam landed on them—and nothing happened.Instead of leaning into the playful moment, both Ice Spice and Sauce Gardner noticeably turned away, sparking widespread speculation and raising eyebrows about the nature of their relationship.UFC President Dana White didn’t shy away from commenting on the viral moment, blasting the pair for missing the kiss cam cue. It was the first time Ice Spice and Gardner had appeared together publicly since romance rumors began swirling, thanks to a photo he posted on his Instagram stories.While the pair’s chemistry has been subject to public scrutiny, this awkward silence spoke louder than any Instagram post. The internet quickly lit up with debates: was Sauce Gardner simply shy? Or was the avoidance a quiet sign that things may not be as romantic as fans hoped?The moment quickly went viral, with many fans feeling Ice Spice deserved more than to be left hanging in public. Some criticized Sauce Gardner for not showing affection, especially given their budding public association. Others defended the 24-year-old Jets star, suggesting he may have been caught off guard or simply trying to maintain privacy in a very public setting.Ice Spice, 25, continues to dominate the music scene, while Gardner, still early in his NFL career, is making waves with the New York Jets. Their paths crossing has made for an intriguing pairing, but their reluctance to embrace the kiss cam moment has left fans wondering where they really stand.Also Read: Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld opens up about discovering her multi-racial roots while preparing for emotional role in ‘Sinners’ Compared to more seasoned celebrity couples like Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner—who have embraced public displays of affection—Ice Spice and Gardner seem more reserved.

Trump wants an apology from Harvard, the White House says | REUTERS

US President Donald Trump has stepped up pressure on Harvard University, demanding that the institution apologise for what he and his administration claim is the promotion of antisemitism.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told journalists on Tuesday, “Trump wants to see Harvard apologise. And Harvard should apologise.”The statement follows Trump's post on Truth Social, where he warned that Harvard might lose its tax-exempt status. “Perhaps Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist-inspired/supporting ‘sickness’? Remember, tax-exempt status is totally contingent on acting in the public interest!” he wrote.Last week, the Trump administration froze over $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts. The freeze came after Harvard refused to follow a new federal directive issued on April 3. The order demanded the dismantling of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, changes to its hiring and admissions policies, and cooperation with immigration checks for international students.In response, Harvard said the directive violates the first amendment and oversteps the federal government’s legal authority. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” the university said in a public statement.The administration’s task force behind the funding freeze insists the measures are necessary to protect civil rights and ensure taxpayer accountability. Harvard, however, says it remains open to dialogue — but not to unlawful demands.","The white house press secretary, karoline leavitt, told journalists on tuesday, “trump wants to see harvard apologise.

After Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi became the second Palestinian student at Columbia with a green card who was arrested by ICE for their deportation. Mahdawi and Khalil co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia in 2023 fall. Mahdawi's arrest is one of the most dramatic one so far pulled off by ICE as he was arrested from a Vermont immigration office where he came to give an interview for finalizing his US citizenship.Instead, he was arrested, making the citizenship interview look like a trap that Mahdawi walked into on his own. There were armed, plainclothes police with their faces covered who handcuffed Mahdawi.""This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal. Mr Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,"" Vermont’s congressional delegation, Senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch and Rep. Becca Balint, said in their joint statement.Born in a refugee camp in the West Bank, Mahdawi has been living in the US for a decade legally. His family remains in the West Bank. He began his citizenship process in 2024 and the interview from where he was arrested was his last step to gain US citizenship. Mahdawi has plans to enroll in a master's program this fall.In defense for their action, the Trump administration cited the foreign policy rule of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that grants the Secretary of State the authority to cancel someone's permanent residency if they are deemed to pose a threat to American foreign policy.Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserted that even permanent citizens can be removed. ""Visiting America is not an entitlement. It is a privilege extended to those who respect our laws and values. And, as Secretary of State, I will never forget that,"" Rubio wrote in an opion piece on Fox News.""US visa holders should know in no uncertain terms that the US government’s rigorous security vetting does not end once a visa is granted,"" he added.",Mohsen mahdawi is the second palestinian student at columbia with a green card who was arrested by ice for their deportation.

Dwyane Wade ’s wife, Gabrielle Union, has emerged as one of the most popular and finest actors in Hollywood. After dealing with her husband’s cancer scare , Gabrielle Union has put all her focus on her career. A few weeks ago, Gabrielle Union was spotted promoting her new movie, Riff Raff, which was released on 28th February 2025, and it seems like shooting for the movie had taken a toll on the actress.In an interview with Moviefone, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, opened up about what it really was like to shoot for Riff Raff.

It forced me to touch places in my life and in my psyche that I'd never really drawn from before.”She added, “It forced me to be a different kind of vulnerable than I've ever played. It scared me a little bit, so if it scares me, I know I should absolutely take it.”Gabrielle Union’s answer also shows that she was ready to take on a challenge after probably going through one of the most difficult and emotional years of her life. The NBA legend Dwyane Wade recently opened up about how he had to go through surgery in December 2023 after doctors found abnormalities in his kidneys.As a result, one of his kidneys had to be removed, and when it was later tested, the doctors found out that the NBA legend was at risk of Stage 1 Cancer.

Hailee Steinfeld on addresses rumours surrounding Avengers: Doomsday

A busy schedule with new projects and a high-profile relationship

Despite being one of the rising stars in the Marvel Cinematic Universe , Hailee Steinfeld ’s name was noticeably absent from the recent cast announcement for Avengers: Doomsday . Fans immediately questioned why the actress, who debuted as Kate Bishop in Hawkeye and appeared in the post-credits scene of The Marvels, wasn’t given one of the now-famous personalized “Doomsday” chairs alongside other confirmed Avengers.In a recent interview with Backstage to promote her upcoming horror film Sinners , Hailee Steinfeld finally addressed the speculation surrounding her MCU future.“I’m excited about the idea of continuing to grow with a character like Kate, especially in something as huge as the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” Steinfeld said. “You get to go back to your family; you get to go back to that little home that then becomes part of this grander picture. I love that character, and I totally understand why she is so loved.”While Marvel fans were hoping for a full Young Avengers lineup reveal, both Steinfeld and her onscreen ally Iman Vellani (Kamala Khan) were missing from the official casting list, raising questions about whether Marvel is saving their returns as surprise moments—or if their roles have been pushed to future projects.Steinfeld is keeping her plate full outside of the MCU.

Kiss and Hug: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos open the Rocket's door

Excitement, song and more from inside the Blue Origin Space flight

Blue Origin announcement by Lauren Sánchez

Pop icon Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , soared to the edge of space Monday morning (April15) aboard Blue Origin ’s New Shepard rocket, marking the first all-female spaceflight in over six decades. Liftoff occurred at 9:31 a.m. ET from Blue Origin’s launch site in West Texas. The suborbital flight lasted approximately 11 minutes, delivering a brief but weightless experience for the six women aboard. Rounding out the historic crew were CBS broadcaster Gayle King, producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA engineer Aisha Bowe , and scientist-activist Amanda Nguyen.The company has previously flown several celebrity passengers, including Bezos himself in 2021, actor William Shatner, and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan. Monday’s flight, however, stood apart — not just for its famous passengers, but for the milestone it represented in space travel history. Blue Origin’s 11th crewed mission comes as the company eyes bigger ambitions. In January, it successfully launched its heavy-lift New Glenn rocket to orbit. Soon after, the company laid off around 10% of its workforce. CEO Dave Limp later said the company remains focused on future goals, including a planned moon landing with an uncrewed vehicle in 2025 and increased frequency for both New Shepard and New Glenn launches.According to a report in Bloomberg, after experiencing roughly four minutes of weightlessness, the capsule returned to Earth under parachutes, landing safely in the desert. Jeff Bezos was on hand to open the capsule’s hatch, where he embraced Sánchez. Perry followed, dropping to her knees and kissing the Earth.“I feel super connected to love,” Perry reportedly said after the flight, clutching a daisy she had taken into space. “It is the highest high, it is surrender to the unknown.” When asked how the trip compared to other highlights of her career, she replied, “This experience is second to being a mom.”During the flight, excitement echoed through the capsule. “You guys, look at the moon! Oh my god!” one crew member exclaimed, while Perry broke into a rendition of “What a Wonderful World.” According to King, the moment was filled with awe and emotion as they gazed at Earth from above.Sánchez first revealed her spaceflight ambitions during a 2023 interview with Vogue, emphasizing the significance of assembling an all-female crew. “These women are paving the way,” she said at the time.The launch drew a high-profile crowd. Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian watched from the viewing area and praised the mission as “inspirational.” Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, was also present. “None of us will ever forget this day,” she remarked.","Katy perry and lauren sánchez, fiancée of amazon founder jeff bezos, soared to the edge of space monday morning (april15) aboard blue origin ’s new shepard rocket.

How Phillies’ Trea Turner helped Bryce Harper

“Pretty cool, pretty special day.”

“I was confused at first, but I think he wanted to share that moment with us, I think it was pretty cool. He’s a pretty creative guy. He let us know in our team meeting. He kind of wanted to share the moment with everybody. He was nice enough to ask me to do it. I thought it was a nice moment for him and his family. I think they were all watching here from up top.”

“I got a text message with the gender; I messed with him a little bit in the dugout. I picked up the pink one and swung it around a little bit. He thought he was having a girl, so I had to mess with him a little bit. Sure enough, it was a boy. I ended up handing him the blue one, and he was pretty happy.”

Trea Turner shares banter with Bryce Harper over gender reveal

“Like I said, he thought he was having a girl, so when I was messing with him, he was like, ‘I knew it was a girl.’ Then, I handed him the blue one. I said, ‘You’re not going to need that pink one.’ He was just excited. I think he would have been excited either way, but now, he’s got two of each. Kind of a complete family already, but like I said, anytime you can add another person to the family, I think it’s special. I think he was super excited.”

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","Letitia james is the first black woman elected to statewide office in new york.
