Decolonisation a route to Hindi imposition?

NEP and Decolonisation

It depends on every individual what they want to consider as a link language. Many people want Hindi as a link language, and some may prefer another. The objective is not to impose one language over another. It is like an orchestra where everything will go in tandem with each other. Pradeep Bhandari said

INDIA bloc on NEP and Hindi 'imposition'

Undoing Macaulay or reimagining India?

In ancient India, knowledge often travelled into the subcontinent, not out of it. Scholars journeyed from China, Korea, Tibet, Central Asia and Persia to study in centres like Takshashila and Nalanda, where mathematics, astronomy, grammar, statecraft and medicine flourished.These were not mere stone structures but the heart of an intellectual civilisation whose instruction was rooted in local languages and knowledge systems. However, over centuries, invasions and later colonial rule thinned this tradition, and by the 20th century, India was no longer exporting knowledge as confidently as it once did.In modern India, polished English often opened doors. It helped in landing jobs, signalled education, enabled migration and allowed an engineer from Chennai and a banker from Delhi to collaborate without needing a common mother tongue.At the same time, English has long carried a social undertone. A fluent speaker is often assumed to be intelligent, cosmopolitan, and somehow ""smarter."" A hesitant speaker may be judged as less capable.It is this perception, not the language itself, that lies at the heart of India’s growing conversation on decolonisation, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a ""Macaulay Mindset"" during a Ram Mandir's Dhwajarohan event in Ayodhya on November 25.English entered India through trade, diplomacy and eventually conquest. The British East India Company and later the Crown used the language for administration and governance. But English did not spread organically. It was strategically introduced to build an intermediary class that would think like the colonial rulers.In 1835, Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and politician, famously argued in “Minute on Indian Education” that English would create a class of Indians who were Indian by birth but English in intellect and sensibilities. Macaulay wanted Indians who were, in his words, “Indian in blood and colour but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.”Macaulay and other early British administrators were ignorant of India’s ancient glories — great literature and philosophy (Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads), sophisticated maths and astronomy (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara), and fabulous architecture (from Mohenjo-daro to Sanchi and Nalanda). This ignorance and racism led Macaulay to say, “A single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia. ”The plan worked. Knowledge systems rooted in Sanskrit, Tamil, Persian and other languages were slowly sidelined. English became the language of courts, universities and bureaucracy. Access to power became tied to access to English.By the early twentieth century, a new elite had emerged. English-educated and urban, and influential. They authored newspapers, argued in courtrooms, entered civil services and steered nationalist politics. Ironically, the language of colonial control also became the language of resistance, enabling leaders like Nehru and Ambedkar to articulate modern political thought for the world.Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sangh’s decolonisation project has widened from language to symbols and institutions. Rajpath was renamed Kartavya Path, the Indian Navy adopted a new ensign inspired by Shivaji Maharaj, and spaces like the National War Memorial, Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and Yuge Yugeen Bharat gallery were created to showcase civilisational continuity.The address of the Prime Minister’s official residence at 7, Race Course Road (7 RCR) was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016 by the New Delhi Municipal Council, replacing a colonial-era name with one that emphasises welfare and public good. PM Modi has also renamed the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as Sewa Tirth.Education reforms through the National Education Policy 2020 encourage mother-tongue learning and allow engineering, medical and law courses in regional languages. Technical textbooks are being translated into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and more, with the UGC expanding regional-language undergraduate programmes. The three-language policy promotes Indian languages alongside English.In January 2022, the government installed a 28-foot hologram of Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate on his 125th birth anniversary, under the canopy where King George V once stood. It served as a temporary tribute before a granite statue replaced it later that year, symbolically shifting the space from colonial memory to the legacy of the freedom struggle.In September 2023, ahead of the G20 Summit in New Delhi, official dinner invitations sent by Rashtrapati Bhavan referred to Droupadi Murmu as the “President of Bharat” instead of the customary “President of India”, marking what was widely reported as the first such instance in an English-language state invite.Government vocabulary now includes terms like Seva Saptah, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Bharat in diplomatic use. Museum projects and tributes to figures like Birsa Munda and Alluri Raju widen the historical lens.However, the conversation around decolonisation is not without anxieties. In several non-Hindi speaking states, particularly in the South and the Northeast, language is tied closely to identity, history and political autonomy.Many regional leaders and scholars worry that the push to move away from English might gradually translate into privileging Hindi at the national level.To them, decolonisation could risk becoming centralisation if it does not explicitly protect linguistic diversity. The concern is less about opposing Indian languages and more about ensuring that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese and others enjoy equal visibility and policy support.Calling PM Modi's decolonisation pitch an effort to recognise India's historical strength and move away from the mindset of a ""white man's burden"", BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""It has nothing to do with what language you speak. The idea here is to focus on and promote indigenous education and inherent strength"".""If you see the New Education Policy, it focuses on recognising inherent talent in the individual irrespective of the language and the region you come from. If one recalls historically, India was an education capital. Our Vedic rituals, ourparampara, were something which the world wanted to emulate. In fact, Nalanda was considered to be a centre of excellence globally, where scholars from across the world used to come, learn, and then try to emulate it in their own countries,"" he said.The BJP leader also countered the notion that the decolonisation push is a route to Hindi imposition, calling it ""unfair and political"" criticism.Referring to the New Education Policy (NEP), he said it focuses on promoting education in one's own language. ""Whether one speaks Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or any other language... the idea is to focus and promote education and excellence in any language of choice.""On the question of language hierarchy and how Hindi-speaking states would connect with non-Hindi-speaking ones if English is deprioritised, he added that in the age of technology, linguistic barriers are dissolving.Chief ministers from the INDIA bloc have repeatedly expressed concerns that the NEP may lead to language centralisation. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has been the most vocal, saying, ""The Centre knows it cannot directly impose Hindi without facing fierce opposition, so it uses education as a backdoor.""Kerala initially opposed NEP, calling it overly centralised and saffronised, although it later agreed to implement PM-SHRI schools while insisting that state autonomy in education must be respected.PM-SHRI, or Prime Minister’s Schools for Rising India, is a scheme launched in 2022 to upgrade around 14,500 existing government schools into modern model schools that reflect the vision of the National Education Policy.CM Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has chosen not to fully adopt NEP, saying the state will follow its own education model instead. The broader concern among these states is that decolonisation should not turn into Hindi dominance and that regional languages like Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali must be given equal space.In Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray have both opposed what they called attempts at ""Hindi imposition,"" particularly in schools. Uddhav described the move to make Hindi compulsory under the three-language policy as a threat to Marathi identity, saying, ""We will not allow the imposition of Hindi.""The Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS even announced a joint protest in Mumbai, after which the state rolled back the order that proposed to make Hindi compulsory as a third language in Maharashtra schools, for Classes 1 to 5.Two centuries after Macaulay, India is not trying to erase English. It is trying to recalibrate identity. English no longer needs to sit at the top of an invisible ladder. Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Manipuri and dozens of other languages do not need to stand below it.If decolonisation means confidence in one’s own language and culture while engaging the world without self-doubt, India might emerge more multilingual, more inclusive and more global than before. The challenge is to ensure that promoting indigenous languages does not turn into replacing one hierarchy with another.Undoing Macaulay will not be about removing English. It will be about removing the idea that language decides intellect. When English becomes one language among many rather than the measure of modernity, India will have truly decolonised.","English entered india through trade, diplomacy and eventually conquest.

IndiGo Fiasco: Civil Aviation Minister Slams Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Monopoly Model’ Remark

NEW DELHI: IndiGo will carry out a “root cause analysis” to determine what triggered the large-scale flight disruptions over the past week, a senior airline official said Sunday.India’s largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.The airline, which normally operates around 2,300 flights daily, expects to fly 1,650 services on Sunday — an improvement from 1,500 flights a day earlier. The official said operations are gradually stabilising and “full stability in operations is expected by December 10”.The official, as quoted by PTI, maintained that IndiGo has enough pilots and rejected concerns of shortages. “Our pilot numbers are fine while we may not have the luxury of having a buffer,” he said, adding that there is “no hiring freeze” and denying that a lean model triggered the crisis.He emphasised that the disruptions stemmed from several simultaneous issues. “We will need a root cause analysis, which will obviously take time...the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role (will be known after the root cause analysis),” he said. The official also described the episode as a “learning experience”, insisting “there was no question of inadequacy”.IndiGo has been struggling since November 1 when the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms — which reduce the number of night landings allowed — came into effect. While all airlines transitioned to the new norms, IndiGo faced the sharpest impact, partly due to having a smaller pilot buffer. ""We did not have the same kind of buffer. But that does not mean that there is a question of inadequacy, no. These are two different things,"" the official said.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras, seeking explanations for the disruptions. Asked whether the meltdown could have been prevented, the official said, ""We will do our root cause analysis... we will do that and then we will come to know (what was the) planning lapse, if at all,"" as quoted by PTI.Looking ahead, IndiGo maintained it is ready for the fog season. The official said the airline has adequate number of aircraft and pilots and is “confident of managing the fog season.”","India's largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.

"Govt caps flight fares, gives IndiGo 2 days to normalise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise/articleshow/125812074.cms,"Aviation Meltdown Escalates As IndiGo Cancels 400 Flights And Government Enforces Fare Controls

Cap on fares comes too late for lakhs

NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees and taxes extra). In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed. These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action in public interest.”","Indigo has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on dec 7, and return bags within two days.

The Trump administration has moved to sharply curtail the validity of work permits issued to refugees, asylees and several categories of immigrants—including those awaiting green cards—marking another major tightening of the country’s immigration system.The new policy, announced recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), reduces Employment Authorization Document (EAD) validity from the current five years to just 18 months for multiple categories of applicants.USCIS said the step is aimed at enabling more frequent vetting following recent security concerns, arguing that shorter validity periods will allow officials to screen applicants more often. This will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens (foreign nationals) with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies. After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens. ” said Joseph Edlow, director, USCIS.In addition, late on Friday, USCIS made another announcement relating to the establishment of a specialized unit, headquartered in Atlanta, to strengthen the ability of officials to screen out terrorists, criminal aliens, and other foreign nationals who pose potential threats to public safety or who have committed fraud or other crimes.Immigration attorneys say the move to reduce the validity period of EADs could trigger widespread disruption, especially for thousands of Indians in the employment-based green card backlog who rely on these work permits to continue working while their adjustment-of-status applications (from non-immigrant visas like H-1Bs to green card) remain pending.In the context of the Indian diaspora based in the US, Kripa Upadhyay, immigration attorney with Buchalter, a law firm said, “The primary impact of this will be on the following groups of Indian applicants who are transiting to a green card: Investors seeking adjustment of status based on a pending I-526/EB-5 application (this relates to the investment linked green card program); parents or spouses of US Citizens seeking adjustment of status in the US and employees in the US who are seeking adjustment based on approved I-140 and available visas. ”For H-1Bs seeking an adjustment of status, she said the change will “leave people in a terrible situation,” with many now needing to file renewals several months in advance to avoid job interruptions. “One cannot work without valid work authorization, so the risk of falling out of lawful employment becomes very real,” she said.The problem is compounded as applications for EAD renewals can typically be filed only 180 days before the expiry of the existing work authorisation permit, whereas processing of the renewal application can take much longer.The move will also impact American employers, as delays in processing of renewals of EADs, especially of key employees, could disrupt projects. Compliance costs will also increase for sponsoring employers.","Donald trump's stricter h-1b visa rule hits indian talent, background check screening expanded.

In the bill's statement of objects it is highlighted that the 10th schedule in the Constitution, popularly known as the anti-defection law, was added by the Constitution (Fifty-second amendment) Act, 1985.It also stated that at present, the 10th schedule provides for disqualification of a member if he votes or abstains from voting in the House, contrary to any direction issued by the political party to which he belongs to.Tewari through this bill seeks an amendment to provide for a provision that an MP shall incur loss of membership only when the MP votes or abstains from voting in the House with regard to a confidence motion, no-confidence motion, adjournment motion, money bill or financial matters contrary to any direction issued by the party to which the member belongs to, and in no other case.The proposed amendment also calls for making room for a provision requiring the chairman or speaker of the House to make an announcement in the House regarding any direction issued by a political party in respect of the aforesaid motions. While making such an announcement, the chairman or the speaker shall also specifically inform members that defiance of the direction issued by a political party will result in automatic cessation of membership.He also proposed that a member should have the right to appeal against the cessation of membership to chairman or speaker, as the case may be, within 15 days from the date of such cessation and the appeal shall be disposed of within a period of 60 days from the date of its receipt.

: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Inaugurating 125 border infrastructure projects, including the key Shyok tunnel in Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said they will not only ensure faster mobility of troops & weapons, but also boost tourism, employment & stronger faith in democracy among people living in remote regions.The projects, the highest number to be inaugurated simultaneously, will significantly improve last-mile connectivity to remote villages & forward military locations, ensuring uninterrupted movement through landslide and avalanche-prone areas.From the site of the 920-metre Shyok tunnel on the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie Road in Ladakh, Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated 28 roads, 93 bridges & four other projects spread across Ladakh, J&K, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Mizoram, which were completed at a total cost of Rs 5,000 crore by Border Roads Organisation.He also inaugurated the Galwan War Memorial.Noting the Modi government’s “unwavering commitment” to keep strengthening border infrastructure & developing border areas in line with the vision of Viksit Bharat, Singh said these connectivity projects are lifelines for security, economy & disaster management. The speed with which India is strengthening its borders with roads, tunnels, smart-fencing, integrated command centres and surveillance systems is proof that connectivity is a backbone of security, and not a separate entity, he said.“Our government, armed forces and organisations like the BRO are working diligently for holistic development of our border areas. We must continue strengthening the bond between the border regions andthe national mainstream so that the relationship is not influenced by any external factors,” he said.Referring to the successful conduct of Operation Sindoor, he said, “Our armed forces launched the operation in response to the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Everybody knows what befell those terrorists. We could have done much more, but our forces, demonstrating both courage and patience, only did only what was necessary.”“Such a massive operation was possible due to our strong connectivity. Logistics were delivered to the armed forces in a timely manner. Our connectivity with the border areas was maintained, making the operation a historic success,” he added.","Rajnath singh virtually inaugurated 28 roads, 93 bridges & four other projects spread across ladakh, j&k, arunachal pradesh, sikkim, himachal.

Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Sunday called on the Punjabi diaspora in Seoul, South Korea to act as brand ambassadors of the state and encourage Korean companies to invest in Punjab, which he said has emerged as a preferred global investment destination.Interacting with members of the Punjabi community during his visit to South Korea, Mann said industry-friendly policies have already drawn investors to Punjab and urged the diaspora to further support the state's push for investment, according to an official statement.He said Punjabis are ""born entrepreneurs"" and stressed the need for collective efforts to place the state on a stronger industrial growth path. The chief minister said the state government has created conducive conditions for industries and said it was time for overseas Punjabis to contribute to their motherland.Mann said enhanced investments would create employment opportunities for youth and boost industrial growth, contributing to the vision of a 'Rangla Punjab'. He lauded the global achievements of Punjabis, noting their hard work, innovation and energy.He said his government aims to make Punjab a preferred global hub for industry by ensuring policy stability, speedy decision-making and a governance system that values investor trust. The state's approach is based on close partnership with industry and enabling growth by addressing investors' needs, he added.Mann further said Punjab has strengthened its infrastructure, expanded its industrial capacity and opened new avenues for investment.He highlighted governance and regulatory reforms, including the single-window system offering 173 services, auto-deemed approvals, PAN-based business identifiers and amendments to the Punjab Right to Business Act for time-bound clearances.More than Rs 1.4 lakh crore of on-ground investments have already been facilitated, the chief minister said.He said partnership between government and industry is key to success and the state government firmly believes that industrial growth can only be achieved when the two work as equal partners.Managing Director of Aran International Chodda Akash evinced interest in investing in the food processing sector, while eminent scholar Dr Lakhvinder Singh welcomed Punjab's initiative to hold an investment roadshow in South Korea, particularly in defence and aerospace.Meenakshi Pawar, chairperson of the Punjabi Association in Korea, said the high-level visit from Punjab after a long interval would open new avenues for long-term cooperation.Earlier, Mann met Ambassador of India to the Republic of Korea Gourangalal Das and outlined Punjab's vision to deepen economic and technological collaboration in sectors such as food processing, agri-tech, renewable energy, manufacturing, defence, aerospace and urban infrastructure.The chief minister highlighted Punjab's evolving industrial ecosystem, progressive policies, and competitive advantages that position the state as a strategic gateway to North India.On Monday, the Punjab delegation will hold meetings with major Korean firms including Daewoo E and C, GS E and C and Nongshim to explore opportunities in construction engineering, infrastructure and advanced food processing. Mann will later attend a roundtable on ease of doing business in Punjab with legal firms, investors and business associations.The chief minister is leading a delegation to Japan and South Korea as part of the state government's outreach ahead of the 6th Progressive Punjab Investors' Summit to be held in Mohali from March 13-15, 2026.","Punjabi diaspora urged to act as brand ambassadors of the state.

An unusual chatter on the Internet intercepted by the army alerted security agencies in the Kashmir valley, leading to the detention of a Chinese national who had entered Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir without permission, officials said on Sunday.Hu Congtai, 29, arrived in Delhi on November 19 on a tourist visa, which permitted him to visit Buddhist religious places in Varanasi, Agra, New Delhi, Jaipur, Sarnath, Gaya and Kushi Nagar.However, leveraging his resemblance to locals, he boarded a flight to Leh on November 20 and did not register at the Foreigners Regional Registration Office counter located at the Leh airport.During his stay, he toured the Zanskar region for three days and visited places of importance in the Himalayan town before landing in Srinagar on December 1, the officials said.A search of his phone history showed that he was looking for the deployment of CRPF in the valley, the officials said, adding he was being questioned by various agencies.According to the officials, he had arranged for an Indian SIM card from the open market.While in Srinagar, where he stayed in an unregistered guest house, the Chinese national went to a Buddhist religious place at Harwan, a place where an encounter had left one Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist dead last year.According to the officials and data extracted from his phone, he had also visited Awantipur ruins in South Kashmir, which is located near Victor Force headquarters of the army in South Kashmir.During his stay, he had also visited different areas of Srinagar, including Shankracharya hills, Hazratbal, and Mughal Garden along the Dal Lake.His phone history showed searches related to CRPF deployments and Article 370 of the Constitution which was abrogated in August 2019 to end the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the officials said.Hu has completed his graduation in Physics from Boston University and has claimed that he likes to travel. His passport shows that he has visited various countries, including the US, New Zealand, Brazil and Fiji, and Hong Kong.The officials said that he had violated the visa regulations and, at best, they could deport him back to his country.","Hu congtai, 29, arrived in delhi on a tourist visa, which permitted him to visit buddhist religious places in varanasi, agra, new delhi, jaipur, sarnath, gaya and kushi nagar.

Bottomline

US President Donald Trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting American workers and manufacturing, promoting it as a cornerstone of his ""America First"" agenda.Since returning to office this year, the Trump administration has overseen a historic surge in tariff collections. According to Fox Business, total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2025 (ending September 30). October alone brought in a record $34.2 billion. The Treasury also already reported $41.6 billion in tariff revenue in Fiscal Year 2026, and since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, monthly collections have climbed sharply—from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together adding $62.6 billion.Trump’s logic was– tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, encouraging manufacturers to relocate production to the United States while generating substantial government revenue.However, examination of economic data and analysis from world-leading institutions reveals a fundamental contradiction between Trump's claims and the consequences unfolding in the American economy.At the core of Trump’s tariff strategy is the belief that foreign producers will shoulder most of the cost.But the economic mechanics of tariffs rarely work that way. A tariff is, fundamentally, a tax on imports — and unless foreign exporters aggressively cut prices, which happens only to a limited extent, most of the burden shifts inward. Economists call this tax incidence, the real-world distribution of who ends up paying once markets adjust. In today’s globalised supply chains, where imported components sit inside everything from electronics to machinery, the incidence is overwhelmingly pushed down the chain.That pattern has been evident for months. Even in mid-2025, when the distribution looked slightly different, Americans were still paying the overwhelming share of tariff costs, according to Goldman Sachs.US consumers absorbed about 22 per cent, while American businesses carried roughly 64 per cent, leaving foreign exporters with only 14 per cent. But the burden is projected to tilt even more heavily toward households by year-end.According to the estimates from earlier this year, US consumers are likely to shoulder around 55 per cent of tariff costs, with American companies taking on 22 per cent.Foreign exporters’ contribution rises only modestly to about 18 per cent, reflecting the limited extent to which they cut prices. The remaining 5 per cent falls into routing adjustments and other leakages rather than any identifiable group escaping the tax.The bottomline is– despite political claims that tariffs make foreign producers pay, the economic weight has always landed — and will continue to land — primarily on Americans themselves.The Federal Reserve's real-time analysis of 2025 tariffs provides definitive evidence of how costs flow through the economy.The Federal Reserve Board examined tariffs implemented in February and March 2025 on imports from China and found that tariffs passed through fully and quickly to consumer goods prices within two months of implementation.Their theoretical analysis predicted that a 10 percentage-point tariff increase on imports from China raises consumer prices across a variety of goods categories, with a large share of goods categories experiencing at least a 1 percent price increase following such a tariff change.By August 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis quantified the cumulative effect: tariffs accounted for 0.5 percentage points of headline PCE annualized inflation and 0.4 percentage points of core PCE annualized inflation between June and August 2025. When measured over the 12-month period ending August 2025, tariffs explained 10.9% of headline PCE annual inflation.Former IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath directly addressed Trump's tariff strategy in October, stating that while tariffs have ""significantly boosted government revenue,"" the gains have come ""largely at the expense of domestic firms and households hitting American businesses and consumers."" She noted specifically that tariffs have ""contributed to higher prices, burdening households,"" with costs rising ""in several everyday consumer items"" including ""household appliances, furniture, coffee. ""Yale Budget Lab's comprehensive analysis of all 2025 tariffs found that consumer prices rise 1.2% in the short-run, equivalent to an average per household income loss of approximately $1,700 in 2025 dollars. This price increase represents a transfer of wealth from American consumers and businesses to the federal government through tariff revenue collection.As we talk about who bears the real burden of the tariffs, it's also important to understand the basics of what happens when tariffs are actually imposed as per the rules of economics.This has indeed been the dominant pattern. Yale Budget Lab's July 2025 analysis found that 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 40% higher shoe prices and 36% higher apparel prices in the short-run, with prices remaining 19% and 17% higher in the long-run respectively. The impact is regressive: lower-income households spend larger shares of income on these essentials, meaning tariffs function as a consumption tax that falls heaviest on those least able to absorb price increases.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose to 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, with core inflation rising to 2.8%—directly contradicting claims that tariffs wouldn't raise prices.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of 40 years of international tariff data found that following tariff increases, the unemployment rate increases by roughly 10 basis points for every 1 percentage point increase in tariff rates. This means that given Trump's tariff increases averaging 20-50 percentage points on major trading partners, unemployment would be expected to rise 0.5-0.6 percentage points—a substantial economic impact.Importantly, the analysis reveals that tariffs act initially as a demand shock—uncertainty causes consumers and businesses to reduce spending, which temporarily suppresses inflation while increasing unemployment. However, this dynamic reverses: ""Over time, the economy adjusts: The unemployment rate returns to its original level or even declines slightly, whereas inflation picks up and peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs, relative to the scenario where tariffs remain unchanged. ""Trump, who has long claimed that tariffs don’t hurt American consumers, ended up acknowledging the opposite — and his latest policy move proves it even further. When Fox News host Laura Ingraham recently pointed out that coffee prices are high, Trump said he would “lower some tariffs” to bring prices down “very quickly.”That admission became reality soon after, when the White House rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products — including coffee, beef, bananas and orange juice — following rising public frustration over soaring grocery bills. Coffee, which is almost entirely imported, has seen prices jump roughly 15 per cent since January, according to CNN, in part because of Trump’s own sweeping tariffs imposed earlier this year.By suggesting that cutting tariffs will reduce prices — and then issuing a sweeping set of exemptions that took effect retroactively — Trump has inadvertently conceded that tariffs function like taxes that raise costs for Americans. This contradicts years of his rhetoric insisting that “foreign countries pay” and that his duties do not fuel inflation.Economists, businesses, and multiple studies have long shown that US importers pay tariffs and often pass those costs on to consumers. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration expects prices for items like coffee and bananas to fall once tariff reductions are announced. Time will tell whether companies reverse the increases.This was not the only recent contradiction. A few days before the “coffee price admission”, Donald Trump acknowledged that American consumers “might be paying something.” The remark came after a reporter cited Chief Justice John Roberts ’ description of tariffs as taxes paid by Americans. Though Trump insisted the US still “gains tremendously,” his comment amounts to a rare admission that tariffs do raise costs for consumers — contradicting his previous statements insisting “foreign countries pay”.When American companies import components from abroad to assemble products domestically, they now pay tariffs on those inputs. A World Bank analysis examining the US-China trade war demonstrated that tariffs on imports of Chinese upstream intermediate goods negatively affect US downstream exports, output and employment. The effects are particularly severe in US industries that rely heavily on targeted intermediate goods.This creates a cascade of cost increases. When companies face tariffs on inputs essential for production—semiconductors, steel, or automotive components—they have limited ability to substitute domestically, amplifying cost pressures throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve's June 2025 Monetary Policy Report acknowledged this dynamic, noting that ""input cost pressures were widespread in manufacturing and retail, largely reflecting tariff-induced increases. ""Trump administration officials have claimed that tariffs are not driving inflation, pointing to specific data suggesting certain metrics have declined. This statement requires careful interpretation based on the timing of tariff effects discovered through rigorous economic research.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of historical international data reveals that tariffs initially create a negative demand shock that temporarily suppresses inflation even as prices for tariffed goods rise. The mechanism operates as follows: Uncertainty about future trade policy causes firms to delay investment and consumers to reduce spending. This demand contraction creates downward pressure on overall price levels that can temporarily mask the upward pressure from higher tariff costs. Foreign exporters, facing reduced demand, may lower their prices to maintain market share.However, this is a temporary phenomenon lasting approximately 1-2 years. Subsequently, inflation surges as supply-side pressures dominate. The San Francisco Fed found that inflation ""peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs."" The administration's statements about stable or declining prices capture data from early 2025—the demand-shock phase—while ignoring the cost-push inflation that follows.This timeline is critical for understanding the economic logic: immediately after tariff increases, weak demand may suppress overall inflation even while specific goods prices rise. But this represents economic contraction, not success. Americans reduce consumption not because they choose to but because they face economic uncertainty and potential job losses. The cost comes later in the form of persistent, elevated inflation years 2-3 after tariff implementation.Tariff revenues have surged in recent months. According to Fox Business, the US collected a record $34.2 billion in October alone. Total tariff receipts reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has already reported $41.6 billion in collections so far for fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs, monthly revenues have climbed sharply — rising from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, while August and September together generated $62.6 billion. Trump has repeatedly highlighted these figures, arguing that tariff revenues — now at historic highs — could finance his proposed one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.Yale Budget Lab's analysis quantifies this tradeoff: while all 2025 tariffs raise government revenue, they simultaneously reduce consumer welfare and economic output more than the revenue collected. As of November 2025, Yale estimates the short-run per-household income loss at approximately $1,700, with the post-substitution effect settling at a $1,300 loss per household.Furthermore, Trump's promise of $2,000 dividend payments faces a fundamental mathematics problem. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump's new tariffs would raise only $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026. But checks limited to tax filers with incomes below $100,000 could cost $279.8 billion—already exceeding two years of projected revenue. Expanding payments to include non-filers could push costs to $606.8 billion, nearly double the expected 2025–26 tariff revenue.The data points overwhelmingly in one direction: tariffs function as a tax on Americans, not on foreign rivals.As mounting evidence shows prices rising even as Washington records historic revenue, Trump’s strategy exposes a deeper dilemma — whether a policy can remain politically popular while imposing growing economic costs on the very households it claims to protect.How the administration navigates that contradiction may determine not only the trajectory of the economy but also the durability of its “America First” economic narrative.","Us president donald trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting american workers and manufacturing.

The bottom line





In the early 2000s, American factory towns began to empty out. In North Carolina, furniture makers who had worked three generations watched their mills close. Across the industrial centres– from Jakarta to Ohio, a quiet devastation spread—not from war or natural disaster, but from an economic force few had anticipated.In the spring of 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, few anticipated the seismic transformation that would follow. Over the next decade, a torrent of Chinese exports swept through global markets with such force that economists gave it a name:By the time the dust settled, an estimated 2.0 to 2.4 million American manufacturing jobs had vanished, wages in affected communities remained depressed for a full decade, and the political landscape of the industrialized world had been permanently altered.Now, twenty-four years later, the tremors have returned—but this time, they emanate not from factories churning out toys and textiles, but from gleaming facilities producing electric vehicles , lithium-ion batteries, solar panels, and semiconductors.Welcome to China Shock 2.0: a techno-industrial upheaval that threatens to be both broader in scope and deeper in consequence than its predecessor.To understand the magnitude of what's emerging, we must first distinguish between the two shocks clearly.The foundational research on the first China Shock comes from economists David Autor of MIT, David Dorn of the University of Zurich, and Gordon Hanson of Harvard. Their landmark 2013 paper in thedocumented how rising Chinese imports between 1990 and 2007 devastated local labor markets across the United States. The findings challenged orthodox economic thinking that assumed workers displaced by trade would smoothly transition to new jobs and industries.The researchers found that import competition explained approximately one-quarter of the aggregate decline in US manufacturing employment during this period. More troubling still, their follow-up work demonstrated that adjustment in affected communities was ""remarkably slow""—wages, labor-force participation rates, and unemployment remained depressed for at least a full decade after the shock commenced.Now, Autor warns of something far more serious. ""The US is in danger of losing the next great manufacturing battle, this time over advanced technologies to make cars and planes as well as those enabling AI, quantum computing, and fusion energy"", he told MIT Technology Review in July.The second is powered by technological leadership, industrial policy of unprecedented scope, and dominance across entire value chains. According to the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), China is now ""the world's sole manufacturing superpower""—a status reflected in hard data that would have seemed fantastical two decades ago.In 2024, China accounted for approximately 27.7% of global manufacturing output by value, producing $4.66 trillion worth of manufactured goods according to World Bank data compiled through the United Nations Statistics Division.By volume metrics, China's share rises even higher—some estimates place it at 35% of global gross manufacturing production, more than the combined output of the United States, Japan, Germany, and India.China's dominance in strategic sectors:""China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere"" Gordon Hanson, now a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, said earlier this year.The competition between Washington and Beijing has fundamentally shifted terrain. Where once the contest centered on textile quotas and steel dumping, today it revolves around semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence computing power, and electric vehicle supply chains.China leads in 57 of 64 critical technologies tracked by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, compared to leading in only three technologies two decades ago. These aren't peripheral capabilities—they include advanced aircraft engines, quantum computing, high-performance computing, and military-linked technologies like autonomous systems and radar with focus on innovation.The asymmetry in government support is staggering. China spends an estimated $450-500 billion annually on industrial subsidies—a figure confirmed by research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Rhodium Group.By contrast, the US CHIPS Act allocates $52 billion over five years. The European Union's Chips Act commits €43 billion. India's Production Linked Incentive schemes total $26 billion. Japan and South Korea have announced roughly $50 billion combined in semiconductor and battery support.Together, these efforts amount to approximately $100 billion per year—one-fifth of China's commitment.The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2025 annual report says ""China Shock 2.0 also threatens to complicate de-risking efforts, as China’s market share gained from export dominance can be quickly turned into leverage over the supply chain.""The report notes that China has begun producing higher-value-added goods at scale, the result of years of technology acquisition, massive government subsidies, and aggressive industrial policies.Yet Goldman Sachs Research remains bullish on China's trajectory. The investment bank raised its real GDP forecast for 2026 from 4.3% to 4.8% and for 2027 from 4.0% to 4.7%, citing the government's determination to advance manufacturing competitiveness and boost exports.""The approval of the new Five-Year Plan proposal highlights the government's determination and capability to keep advancing its manufacturing and boost its export market share"", Goldman Sachs noted in its November analysis.Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs' chief China economist, explained the resilience: ""Chinese exports of chips, semiconductors, autos, auto parts—they are growing steadily despite the fact that the US has imposed tariffs"".In 2024, China recorded the largest global trade surplus in economic history: $992 billion, according to official customs data. This figure beat the previous record of $838 billion set in 2022 and approached the symbolically potent $1 trillion mark.The IMF has documented how China's trade surplus rose substantially following the pandemic, driven by weak domestic demand from a property market downturn and elevated household savings rates. According to a September 2024 IMF analysis, China's trade balance stood between 2% and 4% of GDP. IMF data shows China's export volumes rose approximately 40% between 2019 and 2024, while import volumes increased by only 1%.A central point of contention in the China Shock 2.0 debate concerns the role of state subsidies. Multiple organizations have attempted to quantify the scale of Chinese industrial policy support, with estimates varying significantly.The OECD's Manufacturing Groups and Industrial Corporations (MAGIC) database found that Chinese firms receive ""four to eight times"" the subsidy rates of other firms. A recent IMF working paper estimated that the equivalent fiscal cost of Chinese industrial policy is approximately 4% of GDP per year.For India, the moment represents both peril and extraordinary opportunity.With 67 million manufacturing workers, a growing working-age population, and democratic governance, India could emerge as the critical counterweight to Chinese manufacturing dominance.“India must push manufacturing to grow employment and develop a stronger economy,” Kant said."" said Former Niti aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, India's G20 Sherpa. In September 2025.David Autor emphasized the stakes in his July interview: ""When we think about advanced manufacturing and why it's important, it's not so much about the number of jobs anymore. It's about economic leadership. It's about innovation. It's about political leadership, and even standard setting for how the rest of the world works"".The government's Production Linked Incentive schemes have shown promise. Electronics manufacturing has grown rapidly, with exports reaching $42 billion in 2024. But the scale remains insufficient.Yet India possesses unique advantages. Its demographic dividend is just beginning–the working-age population will continue growing even as China shrinks. The country has demonstrated capabilities in pharmaceuticals, IT services, and automotive manufacturing. Democratic governance provides political stability that reassures Western partners seeking to diversify supply chains.The fundamental question is not whether China Shock 2.0 occurs– but whether countries can coordinate an effective response at sufficient scale before Chinese dominance becomes irreversible.The clock is ticking.As the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission's 2025 Report makes clear:“In many ways, China Shock 2.0 is enabled by the limitations of that system—many countries are constrained in how they can respond to the deluge of China’s excess production despite the growing threat of damage to their labor markets and home industries.”The fundamental question facing policymakers in Washington, Brussels, Tokyo, Seoul, and New Delhi is not whether China Shock 2.0 is coming, but the only question is whether we are ready this time.For millions of workers in automotive plants, battery factories, solar installations, and electronics assembly, the answer will determine not just abstract national competitiveness, but the concrete reality of whether their jobs, communities, and livelihoods can survive the second great wave from the East.","China shock 2.0 may result in chinese producers taking over market share in countries all over the world. The competition between washington and beijing has fundamentally shifted terrain. Where once the contest centered on textile quotas and steel dumping, today it revolves around semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence, and supply chains.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125804046,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1041316,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Wayne Gretzky’s patriotic gesture comes after backlash tied to Trump friendship

Wayne Gretzky has spent a lifetime being celebrated as “The Great One,” but even legends aren’t shielded from public scrutiny. Over the past month, Canada’s most iconic hockey figure found himself unexpectedly caught in a political storm after he remained silent when Donald Trump teased the idea of making Canada the United States’ “51st state.”That silence, coupled with Gretzky’s long-standing friendship with Trump, led to anger from Canadian fans who accused him of abandoning his roots. Yet, when he stepped on stage at the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw, wearing a clear symbol of his heritage on his suit, Gretzky seemed to deliver his response without uttering a single word.Gretzky was one of four major sports celebrities assisting with the World Cup draw, joining Tom Brady, Aaron Judge, and Shaquille O’Neal. With Donald Trump watching on, Gretzky stood out not just because he was the only Canadian on stage, but because he proudly displayed a Canadian flag pin on his lapel. The subtle gesture followed weeks of backlash, and it echoed his recent remarks defending his loyalty to Canada.In a recent episode of 100% Hockey With Millard & Shannon, Gretzky confronted the criticism head-on. When asked whether he understood the disappointment over his silence, he said, “Oh, sure, because Canadians are proud but here’s the two factors.”He went on to explain that although many Canadian entertainers and athletes become U.S. citizens, he chose not to. “I never became an American citizen. I’m Canadian.”He also emphasized that his friendship with Trump is not political, saying, “Well, sure, but as I said to the prime minister, he wouldn’t tell me how to play hockey… I’m not going to tell him what to do in politics. Simple as that.” His comments and his pin, suggest that the hockey icon doesn’t feel he needs to shout his loyalty. For Gretzky, wearing his heritage on his chest says enough.Also Read: “A disgrace to hockey”: Toronto’s power-play plan faces scrutiny as Auston Matthews’ role sparks strong criticism","Hockey legend wayne gretzky faced backlash for his silence on donald trump's remarks about canada.

When will IndiGo normalise operations?





NEW DELHI: India's largest airline, IndiGo , continued to face a major operational breakdown on Friday as pilot-rostering issues escalated into massive flight cancellations for the fourth straight day.More than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports nationwide. The crisis, largely triggered by an unexpected pilot shortage under new duty-time rules, has forced the airline into emergency schedule cuts and triggered a regulatory intervention.Airports reported chaotic scenes, with passengers waiting over 12 to 24 hours, organising protests, and complaining about a lack of communication and even misplaced baggage. Some said they had boarded their aircraft only to be asked to deboard later when flights were abruptly cancelled.IndiGo, which usually operates around 2,300 flights daily with a fleet of over 400 aircraft, has seen its On-Time Performance collapse to 19.7%, down from 35% the day before.IndiGo announced a full-day suspension of all departures from Delhi Airport till 11:59 pm on Friday, intensifying disruption that had already seen more than 300 cancellations in 48 hours up to Thursday.Multiple airports — including Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Goa — also issued lists of cancelled flights as the ripple effect spread across the network.In a statement, IndiGo said, “We confirm that all IndiGo domestic flights departing from Delhi Airport (DEL) on Dec 5, 2025 stand cancelled till 11:59PM. We express our profound apologies to all our valued customers and stakeholders who have been significantly impacted by these unforeseen events.”Passengers across multiple airports expressed anger and helplessness as IndiGo’s massive delays and cancellations left thousands stranded with little clarity or assistance.Many said there was no proper communication, food, or water as they waited for hours. Staff shortages and new crew duty rules have pushed operations into disarray, resulting in nearly 1,000 flights being cancelled over the past few days, with disruptions now stretching into the fourth consecutive day.The airline however listed steps being taken to assist stranded travellers stating that:The airline issued a detailed public apology on Friday, acknowledging the scale of the crisis. In its statement, IndiGo said, “We do deeply apologize and understand how difficult the past few days have been for many of you. While this will not get resolved overnight, we assure you that we will do everything in our capacity to help you in the meantime and to bring our operations back to normal at the earliest.”IndiGo added that December 5 ""should be the day with the highest number of cancellations, as we are doing all that is necessary to reboot all our systems and schedules for progressive improvement starting tomorrow.""The airline also said its teams were working in coordination with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the DGCA to restore normalcy. ""Our teams are working to reinstate regular operations in alignment with the Ministry and DGCA,"" it added.IndiGo announced several support measures for affected passengers and promised automatic refunds. The airline said, “We will ensure that all refunds for your cancellations will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment. Full waiver on all cancellations/reschedule requests for bookings between 05 December 2025 to 15 December 2025.”IndiGo’s large-scale cancellations have triggered a sharp spike in domestic airfares, with last-minute ticket prices on major routes touching record highs as passengers scrambled for alternatives.According to MakeMyTrip (MMT) data, same-day non-stop flights from Delhi to several metros cost up to double the rates for nearby dates.IndiGo has urged passengers to check flight status before leaving home, as widespread cancellations continue. In its advisory, the airline said:IndiGo says it has been hit by multiple unforeseen operational challenges—including crew shortages, winter schedule changes, weather issues, tech problems, and airport congestion.However, the biggest trigger is the stricter Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) rules that came into effect on November 1. The new norms increased weekly rest, extended night-duty definitions and reduced permitted night landings from six to two, following years of pilot fatigue complaints.These rules were mandated by the DGCA after a Delhi High Court order. Airlines had lobbied for a delay, but DGCA enforced them with only limited relaxations.The latest DGCA FDTL rules mandate:The stricter night-duty limits reduced crew availability sharply—affecting IndiGo the most due to its massive network of late-night operations.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Friday it was temporarily relaxing specific provisions of the new Phase-II Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms for IndiGo’s A320 fleet, including rules on night duty between 0000–0650 hours and restrictions on night operations. The exemption is valid until February 10, 2026.The regulator emphasised that the exemption is being granted “in public interest” to ensure continuity of essential air services but warned that safety standards must be strictly followed and the approval could be withdrawn if safety is compromised.IndiGo is now required to submit fortnightly progress reports on crew utilisation and steps taken to improve availability. The airline also has to present a roadmap within 30 days to ensure full compliance with FDTL standards.IndiGo had approached DGCA citing severe operational difficulties following the rollout of new FDTL norms, which lowered the number of night landings allowed per pilot. According to details shared with the regulator, the airline is short of both captains and first officers for its A320 fleet.For December, IndiGo reported availability of 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers, lower than what the new rules demand. The requirement rose significantly after Phase-II norms were implemented.These numbers highlight what officials describe as a crew shortage that IndiGo underestimated, leading to cascading delays and cancellations. On Friday alone, more than 500 IndiGo flights were delayed or cancelled, severely disrupting travel across the country.DGCA noted that current disruptions stem from operational constraints, unpredictable weather and rising seasonal demand. “As we now approach the fog season, the peak holiday period and the marriage travel season, it is crucial that the industry prepares for even greater operational challenges,” the regulator said.Pilot unions have strongly criticised IndiGo’s resource planning.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) said the airline “enforced a hiring freeze even after knowing the impact of the new DGCA rules.”It added that while all other airlines planned ahead and hired adequately, IndiGo “inexplicably adopted a hiring freeze, entered non-poaching arrangements, maintained a pilot pay freeze through cartel-like behaviour, and demonstrated other short-sighted planning practices.”The Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA) said the disruptions point to a failure of proactive resource planning and alleged attempts to pressure the DGCA to roll back stricter duty-time rules.The Ministry of Civil Aviation has directed IndiGo and other airlines to act immediately to restore services. In its order, the ministry said:The ministry added that the government remains “fully alert to the woes of air passengers” and will take “every possible measure, including rule exemptions” to restore stability.IndiGo has said its operations will stabilise within 48 hours, noting that its teams are making “calibrated adjustments” to rotations and night schedules. The airline is redeploying crew on high-stress routes, pre-cancelling select flights and reorganising aircraft rotations.In its meeting with DGCA on Thursday, IndiGo assured that full operational stability will be restored by February 10, 2026, the deadline for which it has sought temporary exemptions.“Our frontline staff and the entire team remain dedicated to restoring normal operations and helping every customer with care and respect,” the airline said.While operations may improve in the short term, IndiGo’s long-term stabilisation now hinges on how quickly it can rebuild its crew strength and fully comply with duty-time regulations that the rest of the industry has already implemented.","More than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across airports nationwide.

Khamzat Chimaev, Pavel Durov and what comes next for ‘Borz’

Khamzat Chimaev posted on X this week asking Telegram founder Pavel Durov to be in his corner for his next fight. The message came while Chimaev is off the fight list for a foot surgery and a planned recovery that will stretch into and after Ramadan 2026.Khamzat Chimaev said he wants a big name with him when he steps back into the Octagon. The post read in part, “Brother @durov in my corner next …” and the invite quickly made headlines across MMA sites and social feeds. Promoters and media now watch to see if Durov, the billionaire Telegram CEO will accept.Khamzat Chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot, sources say. He told reporters he will pause full training until after Ramadan.That timing means he likely will not fight until late March or April 2026, depending on recovery. While he heals, Chimaev has named Nassourdine Imavov as a possible next challenger and has also answered calls for a superfight with Alex Pereira.Chimaev’s public invite to Pavel Durov adds a new twist. Durov is a tech billionaire (listed at about $17.1 billion by some outlets) and he has recently worked with former fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov on Telegram projects.Khabib sold digital papakha collectibles on Telegram and helped raise roughly $4–4.5 million in November 2025, showing how the platform can link fighters and rich backers. That history makes Durov a logical target for Chimaev’s request.There is also history between Chimaev and Team Khabib. The two sides had a near-brawl after UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi in October 2022 when Chimaev pushed Abubakar Nurmagomedov.Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Khabib later helped calm things down. Recently, Chimaev posted a message praising Islam Makhachev and showing he wants peace with the Dagestani group.That all makes a Durov cornering moment possible, since Khabib and Durov have worked together before.Chimaev’s X post and the reports appeared in late November to early December 2025.His surgery and plan to resume full training after Ramadan were reported during the same period by MMA outlets covering UFC offseason news.If recovery goes well, Khamzat Chimaev’s comeback fight could happen in spring or early summer 2026.Also Read: Joe Rogan Claims Jesus May Come Back As Artificial Intelligence And Sends Social Media Into Debate","Khamzat chimaev is injured and will have a small operation on his foot.

Shilo Sanders’ NIL earnings and legal issues under review





Shilo Sanders’ NFL career and bankruptcy case raise questions about NIL earnings





Shilo Sanders, the NFL free agent and son of legendary coach Deion Sanders, is at the center of a growing financial and legal storm. The former Colorado safety, who recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is now accused of making unauthorized transfers totaling $250,000. The controversy revolves around money earned from his college football name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, raising questions about compliance with bankruptcy law.The dispute has attracted significant media attention, as Shilo Sanders’ attorney strongly challenges the claims. Keri Riley, representing Sanders, insists the allegations are fundamentally flawed and argues that the funds in question were legitimately earned after the bankruptcy filing. According to Riley, the earnings, processed through companies created by Sanders, Big 21 LLC and Headache Gang LLC, should not be considered part of the bankruptcy estate.The trustee handling Sanders’ bankruptcy case claims the NFL player improperly transferred funds post-petition, potentially violating federal bankruptcy rules. These transfers, linked to Sanders’ NIL income during and after college, are now under legal review.Riley maintains that the money was generated legitimately and was separate from any pre-bankruptcy liabilities, emphasizing that Sanders’ NIL agreements are a modern revenue source increasingly used by college athletes.Adding complexity, Sanders faces a longstanding financial obligation stemming from a 2015 lawsuit. A former high school security guard in Dallas alleged Sanders caused injuries during an incident, and a default judgment of nearly $12 million was awarded. While Sanders filed for bankruptcy to manage this liability, the current allegations over NIL transfers complicate his path to financial resolution.Despite off-field challenges, Sanders briefly joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent. Reports indicate he signed a three-year contract worth roughly $2.97 million, although he earned just $1,572 in guaranteed money after being released during the preseason. His professional prospects now remain uncertain, with both legal and career questions looming.As this case unfolds, it highlights the intersection of bankruptcy law and modern NIL earnings, an emerging issue for athletes navigating financial and legal obligations. With Sanders’ attorney disputing the trustee’s claims, the outcome could set an important precedent for how post-bankruptcy NIL income is treated in the future.Also Read: “Never seen a call like that”: Dak Prescott slams referees after controversial penalty in Lions’ 44-30 win over Cowboys","Nfl free agent shilo sanders faces $250k nil transfer dispute amid bankruptcy case.

Conor McGregor and James Lawrence denied appeal as Nikita Hand responds

Nikita Hand has spoken out after the Supreme Court in Dublin refused to hear the appeals of Conor McGregor and James Lawrence in her long-running civil case. The decision was announced on Thursday, when the court confirmed that both men would not be allowed to challenge earlier rulings made in the High Court. The civil case began after an incident that took place in December 2018 at a hotel in south Dublin.Last year, Nikita Hand, also known as Nikita Ní Laimhín won her civil action and was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages. She also received a ruling that Conor McGregor must cover about €1.3 million in legal costs. After Thursday’s update, Hand posted on social media, saying she is relieved that this part of the process is over and grateful for the support she received throughout the case.The Supreme Court ruling came on Thursday morning in Dublin. The judges stated that Conor McGregor “had a fair hearing” during the original trial and found no reason to allow his appeal.McGregor’s appeal request focused on questions he was asked in court about his “no comment” answers during a Garda interview.The court looked at that claim and rejected it, stating the trial judge acted within legal rules. James Lawrence, who was also part of the original case, was not found liable for assault by the jury in the civil trial.However, the trial judge had ruled that Nikita Hand did not have to pay his legal costs. Lawrence appealed that decision, but the Supreme Court judges also rejected his request, saying the lower court followed “well-established principles.”After the ruling, Nikita Hand shared a short message online. She wrote that she was “thankful this step is now closed” and that she hopes to continue moving forward.Her message was posted shortly after news outlets in Dublin published the decision. In the High Court Nikita Hand received €214,994 in damages last year at the termination of the original case.In December 2018 at a hotel in south Dublin, the event central of the case took place.During the civil case, the jury heard extensive evidence; the ultimate decision demanded McGregor to pay the damages as well as about €1.3 million in legal expenses.The Supreme Court's ruling marks the most recent update in a years-long case.
