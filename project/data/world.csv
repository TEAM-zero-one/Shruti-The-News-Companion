NEW DELHI: The India-US interim trade deal looks more like a “pre-committed purchase agreement” that overturns every principle of reciprocity, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday, adding that Union ministers S Jaishankar and Piyush Goyal have avoided giving clear answers regarding the scale, timeline or fiscal impact of agreement with the US.Initiating a discussion in LS on the Budget, Tharoor termed it as “underwhelming” and a “squandered opportunity, equivalent to rearranging the airbags on a crashing car, while assuring the passengers that the chassis is sturdy and they will feel better afterwards”.On govt’s claim that India secured a “better deal” with the US than other Asian economies, he said the assertion does not withstand scrutiny. “It appears less like a FTA and more like a pre-committed purchase that overturns the very idea of reciprocity,” he asked.He said while India may have received tariff reductions of 1-2 percentage points, no East Asian economy has agreed to deliberately erode its trade surplus with the US through guaranteed purchase obligations.Targeting govt, Tharoor said this is not governance but headline management where “promises are loud, Budgets are grand, but delivery is conspicuously absent”.

Key highlights from the fact sheet:

Both governments plan to work on rules of origin so that the advantages negotiated under arrangement accrue mainly to two countries.

The White House release claimed that India will end its digital services taxes and has agreed to pursue an ambitious set of bilateral digital trade disciplines aimed at discriminatory or burdensome measures and other impediments, including rules preventing customs duties on electronic transmissions.

The two sides also signalled closer coordination on economic security. ""The United States and India committed to strengthen economic security alignment to enhance supply chain resilience and innovation through complementary actions to address non-market policies of third parties as well as cooperating on inbound and outbound investment reviews and export controls,"" the release stated.

A significant rise in two-way trade in technology products and broader joint cooperation in the sector is expected.

What's next for India-US trade deal?

India-US trade deal: Washington on Tuesday issued a fact sheet outlining the ""path forward"" for the newly concluded ""historic trade deal"" with India. The agreement was announced last week after a telephonic conversation between PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump when they agreed on a framework for an Interim Agreement.Under the arrangement, India will benefit from lower duties on a broad range of exports, including textiles and garments, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber products, organic chemicals, home decor items, artisanal goods and certain categories of machinery.In return, New Delhi will eliminate or cut tariffs on US industrial goods, along with a large group of agricultural and food products. These include dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum used as animal feed, tree nuts, fresh as well as processed fruits, soybean oil, and wine and spirits.As part of the exchange, Trump agreed to withdraw the additional 25% duty imposed on Indian imports, pointing to New Delhi's commitment to halt purchases of oil from the Russian Federation.An Executive Order formalising the rollback was signed the same day. Washington further added that in light of India’s ""willingness to align with the United States to confront systemic imbalances in the bilateral trade relationship and shared national security challenges"", the reciprocal tariff will be brought down from 25% to 18%.India will scrap or cut duties on American industrial products and on a wide basket of agricultural and food exports. Among the items listed are dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, selected pulses, soybean oil, wine and spirits, along with other goods.Alongside, India will also be importing more goods from the United States, targeting purchases exceeding $500 billion across energy, information and communication technology, farm goods, coal and additional categories.The Joint Statement also records a commitment from India to deal with non-tariff obstacles that affect bilateral commerce in priority areas.The White House statement further claimed that India has historically applied some of the steepest duties faced by the United States among major economies, with agricultural tariffs averaging as high as 37% and levies topping 100% on certain automobiles. Washington also pointed to what it calls a pattern of protectionist non-tariff measures that have shut many American products out of the Indian market.Implementation work on the newly agreed framework is expected to begin in the coming weeks, as both countries aim to finalise the Interim Agreement and ultimately conclude a BTA that would secure lasting benefits for US workers and companies.Negotiations will continue in line with the BTA Terms of Reference. This includes unresolved tariff issues, non-tariff and technical barriers, customs and trade facilitation, regulatory practices, trade remedies, services and investment, intellectual property, labour, the environment, government procurement and practices considered trade-distorting or unfair involving state-owned enterprises.""Today’s announcement provides a tangible path forward with India that underscores the President’s dedication to realizing balanced, reciprocal trade with an important trading partner,"" the release said.","India-us trade deal announced last week after telephonic conversation between pm narendra modi and us president donald trump.

NEW DELHI: Discussion on the no-motion confidence against Lok Sabha Speaker is likely to take place on March 9, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after opposition parties put in motion the process to oust Om Birla as Lok Sabha speaker, alleging that he had acted in a ""blatantly partisan"" manner in the House and prompting him to step aside from chairing the proceedings till the matter is settled.Meanwhile, Lok Sabha secretariat officials said that Birla has decided not to sit in the Speaker's chair until the no-confidence motion moved against him is settled.In its motion, opposition also accused the speaker of making certain false claims against the Congress members when he spoke of some ""unexpected action"" in the Lok Sabha and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to come to the House to reply to the debate in the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address.Article 94C of the Constitution deals with provisions for the removal of the speaker or the deputy speaker of the Lok Sabha.Article 96 of the Constitution gives the speaker an opportunity to defend himself or herself in the House.The speaker can cast his vote when the motion for his removal is moved in the House.

In an unprecedented move, the Motion of Thanks was passed on February 5 without the customary speech by the prime minister. The speaker read out the Motion of Thanks to the President for her address, and it was passed by a voice vote amid sloganeering by opposition members.Birla said he received concrete information that many Congress MPs could carry out an ""unexpected act"" by reaching the spot where PM Modi sits and, therefore, he asked him not to come to the House to deliver his address.","Lok sabha speaker om birla likely to face no-confidence motion after naravane memoir row.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies have been made available to the public by Penguin Random House India. Any copies currently in circulation constitute an infringement of PRHI’s copyright and must immediately be ceased. PRHI shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. ”The memoir is yet to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence.The excerpt was published by an online portal. In it, Naravane, who was the 28th Chief of Army Staff from December 2019 to April 2022, quotes defence minister Rajnath Singh as conveying Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s message: “Jo uchit samjho woh karo” (take whatever action you deem appropriate).The purported remarks were made in August 2020, at the height of the India–China military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Opposition has claimed that the vagueness of the alleged instructions amounted to an “abdication” of responsibility by PM Modi during the crisis.","Former army chief gen naravane endorses penguin statement on his ""unpublished"" memoir.

"Top astrophysicist Duncan Lorimer says ‘universe is expanding’, lauds role of 2 Indians in studies on fast radio burst",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/top-astrophysicist-duncan-lorimer-says-universe-is-expanding-lauds-role-of-2-indians-in-studies-on-fast-radio-burst/articleshow/128175320.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: World-renowned astrophysicist Prof Duncan Lorimer, who led the discovery of the first Fast Radio Burst (FRB) as among the brightest and most mysterious radio pulses in the universe, said here on Monday that the “universe is expanding” and that with “new and improved telescopes coming up in the US and Canada, we can find out more deep mysteries of this universe”.A fast radio burst (FRB) is an intensely bright, millisecond-long flash of radio waves originating from deep space, often from billions of light-years away. These fleeting, high-energy events emit as much energy in a fraction of a second as the sun does over several weeks.The first FRB was discovered by Lorimer and his student David Narkevic in 2007 when they were looking through archival pulsar survey data, and it is, therefore, commonly referred to as the ‘Lorimer burst’.During a discussion on ‘The Brightest Pulses in the Universe’ at the PM Museum and Library (PMML), Nehru Planetarium here, Lorimer, a fellow of the Royal Society, and professor of physics and astronomy at West Virginia University, USA, lauded two Indian researchers and his colleagues— Shamil Chatterjee and Shriharsh Tendulkar — for playing significant roles in identifying the host galaxy and origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts .Duncan Lorimer and his wife Maura McLaughlin had received the Shaw Prize, described as the “Nobel Prize of the East”, for helping discover FRBs.Whenasked the astrophysicist of any possibility of aliens trying to contact humans from other parts of the universe through different radio frequencies, Lorimer said, “There is a possibility that some fractions of fast radio burst might have an unexpected phenomenon. If we dig deeper into the data as we get tens and thousands of signals, we might find some that are anonymous. There might be some components in future (with links to aliens). I might not have seen it directly till now.”On the divided opinion of scientists about the real characteristics of alleged interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS that had entered the Milky Way galaxy last year, Lorimer stayed away from the controversy, saying, “I did not follow that story, so I don’t have an opinion on it.”While interacting with students, Lorimer explained to them the origin and characteristics of neutron stars, deep holes and radio bursts from different galaxies.Highlighting the significance of the event, Ashwani Lohani, director, PMML, said: “It is a great privilege for PMML and Nehru Planetarium to host Prof. Duncan Lorimer. This interaction is a wonderful opportunity for students, young researchers, and the wider public to engage directly with a scientist whose work has transformed our understanding of the universe. Such events inspire curiosity, scientific temper and a deeper appreciation of India’s growing engagement with global science. ”","World-renowned astrophysicist prof duncan lorimer led the discovery of the first fast radio burst (frb) a fast radio burst is an intensely bright, millisecond-long flash of radio waves originating from deep space.

Age relaxation: The ability to deduct the years of military service plus three years from their actual age for civil job eligibility,” the ministry said. Under rule 2, clause (c) amendment, the definition of ‘ex-servicemen’ now explicitly lists 'Military Nursing Service of the Indian Union alongside Regular Army, Navy, and Air Force, it said.On April 17, last year, a Supreme Court division bench, comprising Justice PS Narasimha and Justice Manoj Misra, had passed the aforementioned order while upholding the ruling of a division bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Feb 2024.The matter came under judicial scrutiny following a petition filed by Captain Gurpreet Kaur of MNS, who had cleared the examination for Punjab Civil Services in 2021, but her candidature was rejected on the ground that she was not an “ESM (ex-servicemen)”. She had then approached the HC, pointing out that MNS was an “Armed Force of the Union” under the statute and that the Punjab ESM rules covered short service officers released on completion of terms of engagement with gratuity under the definition of ESM.",The notification of ex-servicemen (re-employment in central civil services & posts) amendment rules 2026 under article 309 of the constitution came into effect on feb 9.

Is India less alarmed by Donald Trump than the West? Here's what survey says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-india-less-alarmed-by-donald-trump-than-the-west-heres-what-survey-says/articleshow/128155646.cms,"Zero Tariffs For No Russian Oil? White House’s India-US Trade Deal Factsheet Clarifies What’s Real

What the report says

Era of 'wrecking-ball politics'

As much of the Western world recoils from Donald Trump ’s return to the White House, India’s reaction looks strikingly different. The Munich Security Report 2026 presents Indian public opinion on US President Donald Trump as distinct from that of most Western democracies, marked by relatively higher approval of his policies, rising concern about US economic coercion, and declining belief in the necessity of US global leadership.Around 38% of Indian respondents agreed that Trump’s policies were good for India, and approximately 36% agreed they were good for the world. These levels of agreement are significantly higher than in Canada, France, Germany, and Japan, where agreement typically remains in the low teensAccording to the MSI, India ranks among the more favorable countries when respondents were asked whether “Donald Trump’s policies are good for my country” and “good for the world.”The report noted that Indian respondents were less critical of Trump than Western public and more likely to express conditional or partial approval of his approach, even when uncertainty remains about its global impact.While Indian views of Trump’s geopolitical impact were comparatively less negative, the report recorded greater concern regarding his economic policies. Trump administration imposed 50% tariffs on India.With the recent India-US trade deal, the additional 25% tariffs was brought down to 18%.The report stated that the US risk score for India increased by 18 points between 2024 and 2025, the largest increase recorded among all risks in the Indian profile. Despite this rise, the US did not rank among India’s top perceived threats; China remained a higher concern, while Russia was viewed as comparatively low risk.The findings are based on the Munich Security Index (MSI), which surveys public attitudes across G7 and major Global South countries.The report framed Trump as a central figure in what it called an era of “wrecking-ball politics,” characterized by challenges to multilateral institutions and the post-1945 liberal order.In the Indian case, the report highlighted long-standing skepticism toward the Western “rules-based order,” which policymakers have criticized for selective application and double standards.The report cited external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assessment that the existing order has often appeared “anarchic and permeated by double standards” from a Global South perspective. Within this context, the report suggested that Trump’s challenge to established institutions was not uniformly perceived as negative in India.","The munich security report 2026 presents indian public opinion on us president donald trump as distinct from that of most western democracies.

'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

AI in classrooms

AI in content writing: Efficient or shallow?

Can we trust AI?

AI's side of the story

ChatGPT: The commonly used bot emphasised on the important aspect discussed by people as well, that it’s not about the AI itself but how it’s used that determines if it’s affecting human thinking . “It’s a tool—it can be a brain booster or a crutch,” it said.

Grok: Grok stood firm stating that “AI isn't inherently ""making us dumber"" or ""killing"" critical thinking in some irreversible, universal way”. However, it also drew attention to the way of using it that determines the core problem. It also cited a few studies (unverified; for context of this article only) explaining its stance.

Perplexity: Perplexity also gave a balanced view. Like others, it listed the pros and cons. “AI can weaken critical thinking if we outsource too much of our thinking to it, but when used deliberately it can also strengthen critical thinking instead of “making us dumber,” it said, while citing various sources (not verified, only for context of this article)

Meta AI: Rather than giving a definitive answer, it gave various viewpoints of people, pointing out both sides of the debate, while also highlighting that intention and way of using that actually decides if AI is making us dumber. “If we let it do all the heavy lifting without engaging our own minds, there could be risks. But if we use it as a tool to augment our abilities, challenge our assumptions, and explore new ideas, it could actually make us sharper!” it said.

Ally or hurdle; choice is ours

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a handy tool these days. It helps us think faster, clearer in moments of confusion, and often offers a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic digital world. For many, AI tools like ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity etc. are no longer optional aids but daily companions.There was a time when being stuck meant slowing down. Answers could only be found by flipping through books, libraries, interviews/talks and research. The process could often be frustrating, but it forced engagement. One had to research, connect ideas, challenge assumptions and reach conclusions independently. Critical thinking was not an optional skill that could be outsourced.Today, a single prompt can generate an instant answer. Tasks that once took hours now take minutes. Quantitative productivity has undeniably improved. But speed comes with trade-offs. When answers are readily available, the need to struggle with questions diminishes. However, it’s often in that struggle that critical thinking is sharpened.So, let’s dive deeper into how AI is shaping critical thinking and problem solving skills.When we refer to artificial intelligence, we must start from the time critical thinking is in the process of development – the school age. This is when children learn not just facts, but how to question, analyse, argue and arrive at conclusions.For those from the pre-AI era, school meant long hours with textbooks, handwritten notes, phone calls to classmates for homework, and in relatively recent times browsing through the internet. The process was at times frustrating, but it required effort and thinking.Today, the school age looks very different. A single prompt on ChatGPT, Meta AI, or similar platforms can generate structured answers within seconds. Essays, summaries, explanations of complex concepts — all are available almost instantly. The efficiency is undeniable. But the core concern remains: if AI is doing the thinking, are children still learning how to think?Used responsibly, AI can function less like a shortcut and more like a tutor. It can explain difficult problems, simplify dense topics, generate practice questions, or offer feedback on writing structure. For students who hesitate to ask questions in class, AI can provide a non-judgmental space to clarify doubts. In that sense, it may democratise access to academic support.Although there is a risk of passive consumption. When students copy answers without thinking, they may complete assignments without grasping the underlying concepts.This was explained by Tulikaa, a high school teacher in Georgia, US. “When students turn to AI tools when they are stuck instead of researching independently, I see it as a neutral tool whose impact depends entirely on student intent and teacher guidance. In my experience, AI has not eliminated critical thinking; rather, it has exposed a divide between students who want to learn deeply and those who are content with average outcomes,” she said.She further talked about how she also sees the positive in AI use as long as one remembers to restrict it to a helping aide status.Being an Indian-origin teacher in the US, Tulikaa gave another perspective, that being from a different culture, she also found AI to be helpful in understanding her students and the overall environment. Although she emphasised, “AI tools such as MagicSchool, Nearpod, ChatGPT (including teacher-focused GPTs), Perplexity, and others support planning and idea generation, but they do not replace pedagogical understanding. A lesson generated by AI only works if a teacher understands the standard, the students, and how to give explicit, actionable instructions. Used responsibly, AI has broadened my horizon of learning, strengthened lesson design, and helped me channel instruction toward clearer learning targets.”Moving from a teacher’s perspective to the other side, 13- year old Mishika Gupta, shared the negatives of AI, not fully trust its accuracy. Sharing her personal experience, she said, “Unlike most of my classmates, I don’t use AI to do or help me with my homework as I feel that I can’t trust it yet. I have seen on multiple occasions that it doesn’t give the right answers. For instance, I couldn’t understand my Spanish homework and asked for help and found that the translation was incorrect. ”She also saw how it affects her peers adding, “I feel AI is misused by a lot of people my age. They use it to do their homework everyday. Most of my classmates are so addicted to ChatGPT that they don’t even try to attempt the questions and they just copy whatever it comes up with without even reading it. I feel like it has killed the creativity of the kids my age. Some of them literally chat with it like it’s their bff. They share their feelings with it and ask it to solve their life problems. ”Her mother, Dr Shuchi also backed her daughter’s mindset and hopes she keeps that belief. Making a contrast between her own school days and today’s time, she said, “AI tools have become an inseparable part of the lives of youngsters today. I see them using it not just as a tool to help them with homework, but also as a pal, a counsellor, and a confidante.”“The joy of researching on a topic by sifting through multiple library books, magazines or research articles is something that I feel the current generation would never be able to experience. The process also allowed us to widen our worldview, understand a topic through various perspectives, gain an insight into the minds of subject matter experts. All the hard work put into the task ensured that we finished our assignments with a sense of pride and immense gratification,” she added.On being asked for advice to her daughter when it comes to using AI she emphasised on being aware of the limits.Meanwhile, Om Prakash Bhatia, another parent, had his own reservations on AI, believing it’s killing children’s creativity.Thus, the AI and homework debate is not black and white. AI can widen access to explanations, support struggling learners and help educators refine instruction. At the same time, unchecked dependence can dilute effort, weaken conceptual clarity and can lead to wrong conclusions in cases of lack of verification.Ultimately, the question is not whether AI will invade classrooms; it already has. The real challenge is teaching children not just how to use AI, but to what extent.One of the fields where AI is widely used is content writing. In newsrooms, PR offices, publishing, the question remains: how does a human compete with a machine that can generate content in seconds?AI undeniably accelerates production. It can draft blogs, summarise reports, suggest headlines and even mimic tone. But writing is not merely about grammatically correct sentences. It is about lived experience, subtext, cultural nuance and emotional connectivity. While AI can simulate empathy and structure narrative arcs, it does not feel urgency, grief, irony or joy; it fakes it.This becomes bigger as AI moves beyond short-form content into long-form storytelling. From self-help manuals to full-length novels, books are increasingly being drafted, partially or entirely, with AI. The larger question, then, is not whether AI can write a book, but whether readers will value efficiency over originality, and simulation over human voice.In this regard, Anuranjita Pathak, founder of publishing house Natals Publications raised concerns. “Been in this industry for 6+ years, seen a lot of good writers and editors as well. The time in delivery of content/novels has shrunk drastically. I know someone who wrote a book in 4 years- the depth of those 4 years, cannot be written with AI. So there's a definite decline in original thoughts and critical depths.”Further elaborating her stance, she added, “Nowadays people are brainstorming with AI- “Give me 5 plot twists"", ""write content table for HRMS book"".”Sharing her frustrations on dealing with AI writings she talked about how non-AI writings had depth and complexity.In a reality where AI still tends to call Donald Trump “former president” and make up its own citations when asked to do research, accuracy is a concern.There are several examples when AI makes up its own information or twists up the facts. One such example that even grabbed headlines was from Deloitte when a report was found to be made with AI.Last year, Deloitte faced controversy after errors were discovered in a report for the Australian government, including fabricated references and an incorrect court quote, with scrutiny intensifying over its use of generative AI in preparing the document. Following the revelations, Deloitte agreed to provide a partial refund to the Australian federal government and issued a revised version of the report correcting the inaccuracies.Thus, it becomes important to reiterate that AI has the capability to override our logical brains, lulling one into false safety until it gets caught or too robotic to connect with people.Since we are talking about AI, it’s important to hear what the bots have to say too.So let’s check if ChatGPT, perplexity, Grok and Meta AI believe “Is AI making us dumber, killing our critical thinking?Looking at the insights of humans and bots, it becomes clear that the impact of AI on human thinking is not simply about using AI. In fact it depends on how we choose to use it. In itself, it is a neutral tool.When relied upon blindly, it risks killing creativity, problem-solving, and independent thought.On the other hand, when used responsibly, AI can augment human intelligence. It can help organise ideas, provide new perspectives, simplify complex concepts, and inspire creative solutions that we might not have considered on our own.The key to that is balance, using AI as a helper rather than a substitute, a partner rather than a replacement for original thoughts.The fact is, we aren't made smarter or dumber by artificial intelligence but by our choices about how we interact with it. We're given a chance to think, to wonder, and to decide: will we let it think for us, or let it help us become even smarter? The answer will shape the future of learning and creativity in an AI-driven world.","Artificial intelligence (ai) has become a handy tool these days.

Full implementation expected to follow once technical, security and biometric systems are linked across all member states.

Who is eligible to apply for the GCC Unified Visa?



A valid passport with sufficient remaining validity (typically six months minimum).

Supporting documents like proof of accommodation and return/ onward travel.

Travel insurance covering all GCC states may be required.

Why the GCC Unified Visa matters



Seamless multi-country travel: Visit multiple member states without applying for separate visas, a huge boon for global travellers.

Biometric and border control integration across all six nations. Common digital application and data-sharing platforms. Security and immigration protocols to ensure regional safety and streamlined entry.





The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprising of Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman is moving forward with a long-planned Unified Tourist Visa that could transform travel across the Gulf region. This initiative, often described as a “Schengen-style visa” for the Gulf, aims to let visitors enter all six member states on a single travel permit, eliminating the need to apply for separate visas for each country.Officials sometimes refer to this new permit as the GCC Grand Tours Visa or Unified GCC Tourist Visa. Travel and tourism authorities have repeatedly emphasised that this is not just a travel document but a key step in deeper regional economic integration and tourism growth.Although the unified visa was originally expected to start as early as late 2025, plans have been pushed to 2026 due to the complexity of aligning immigration systems, security protocols and data-sharing across six sovereign states. According to travel industry reporting, the rollout will unfold in stages:No exact day or month has been publicly confirmed yet as authorities have only reiterated that the visa will go live in 2026 (at latest early 2027 according to some officials).The unified GCC visa will be designed primarily for non-citizen visitors (tourists, business travellers, conference attendees and multiple-destination holidaymakers) who want to explore the Gulf without the hassle of applying for individual visas for each country. Key predicted eligibility criteria include:Authorities are expected to launch an online application portal where travellers can submit their details digitally and receive the visa electronically, similar to e-visa systems in other regions.Official fee structures have not yet been confirmed by GCC authorities, but industry sources and draft proposals indicate that the unified visa could cost in the range of US $100–$150 (approx. AED 367–550). This price range would make the unified GCC visa competitive with other regional multi-country visas, and far simpler than paying for six separate tourist visas for each member state.The digital process and single-application design are expected to reduce administrative overheads and processing delays, helping travellers plan trips without multiple embassy visits.While final rules are still pending official publication, proposals for the unified visa include several options:The exact structure (single entry vs multi-entry, extension rules, etc.) will be published when the official visa framework and application system launch, but authorities have emphasized flexibility to accommodate both short holidays and longer multi-destination itineraries.The GCC Unified Visa is considered a game-changer for travel and tourism in the Middle East Officials have drawn inspiration from the European Schengen visa model, though the GCC’s version will be adapted to regional needs and security standards. Before the visa becomes fully operational, GCC member states need to finalise:If pilot testing in late 2026 goes smoothly, widespread availability could follow in early 2027 though authorities remain optimistic about a 2026 launch for general applications.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 promises a major shift in how travellers explore the Gulf. It's launch is expected in 2026 (pilot late-year, full rollout to follow), eligibility includes tourists and other visitors with valid travel credentials, fees is estimated at US $100–$150 range with validity of likely 30–90 days, with single or multiple entries. This unified system could be a milestone for regional travel and a boost for the Gulf’s tourism, business and investment landscape.","The gulf cooperation council is moving forward with a long-planned unified tourist visa that could transform travel across the gulf region.

Central government employees and pensioners have reason to cheer with the website for the 8th Pay Commission going live, seeking feedback and inputs from concerned individuals.The 8th Pay Commission was first announced in January 2025, and it was formally notified later through a Ministry of Finance notification issued on November 3, 2025. The government has already approved the 8th Pay Commission’s Terms of Reference (ToR), giving it a period of 18 months to submit its recommendations on revisions to salaries, pensions, and other allowances of government employees and pensioners.With the 8th Pay Commission now constituted, the government has introduced its official website (https://8cpc.gov.in/). With the launch of the website, the 8th Pay Commission has now invited suggestions and feedback from ministries, departments, central government employees, and other stakeholders.In a statement published on the new website, the Commission said it is seeking views, opinions, and inputs to help it make well-informed recommendations. The final date for submitting responses to the questionnaire is Monday, March 16, 2026. The website reads:The 8th Pay Commission has clarified that the identities of respondents will remain confidential, and the feedback received will be examined and presented only in an aggregated and non-attributable form.The 8th Central Pay Commission is expected to have an impact on restructuring pay scales, allowances, and pension benefits for millions of central government employees and pensioners.The questionnaire is open to a wide range of participants, including:In December 2025, four Members of Parliament raised questions in the Lok Sabha regarding the timeline for implementing the 8th Pay Commission, seeking clarification from Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, according to an ET report.In his response, the minister did not specify an implementation date. He said that the government would decide when the 8th Central Pay Commission recommendations would come into effect and that suitable financial provisions would be made once the recommendations accepted by the government are implemented.According to Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, Director – Payroll Services at Nexdigm, arrears under the 8th Pay Commission may be estimated by multiplying the difference in monthly salary by the number of months for which implementation is delayed.The revised pay is calculated by applying the approved fitment factor to an employee’s existing basic pay under the 7th Pay Commission.Krishnamoorthy explained that arrears generally consist of:The overall arrears amount depends on the duration of the delay, which could typically range between 18 and 24 months.","The 8th pay commission was first announced in january 2025, and it was formally notified later through a ministry of finance notification issued on november 3, 2025.

(AI image)



Gold, Silver Prices Today: Top 10 Things To Know

In global commodity markets, gold prices were around the $5,000-an-ounce mark. Prices climbed up to 1.7% on Monday, recovering nearly half of the losses incurred after retreating sharply from the record high recorded on January 29. Silver continued to display greater volatility, with price movements intensified by speculative activity and relatively limited over-the-counter trading volumes. After dropping by more than one-third from its peak level, the metal gained as much as 5% on Monday, moving back above $80 per ounce. According to Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart, gold is likely to maintain support near $4,555 per troy ounce on a closing basis, while silver could hold above $65 per troy ounce. On the MCX, he estimates gold support at Rs 1,54,000–Rs 1,51,800 and resistance at Rs 1,57,700–Rs 1,60,000. Jain advises accumulating gold within the 154,000–152,000 band, keeping a stop loss below 150,500, with upside targets of 156,800–159,000. For silver, he suggests buying in the 250,000–244,000 range, placing a stop loss below 236,600, and aiming for targets of 2,55,500–2,62,000 and 2,65,500. Market analysts are of the view that the recent sharp surge in silver prices was not primarily driven by industrial demand. Instead, it was largely fuelled by speculative buying, as investors rushed in amid fears of missing further gains. A report by Mirae Asset Mutual Fund noted that while the rally initially rested on familiar and previously credible themes, silver eventually moved well beyond its underlying fundamentals. For years, silver has remained in gold’s shadow, with gold continuing to dominate as the preferred safe-haven during periods of geopolitical uncertainty and concerns over weakening fiat currencies. Both investors and central banks largely favoured gold during such phases. According to Chirag Mehta, CIO at Quantum AMC, the decline in the US dollar and growing doubts surrounding its long-term reserve currency role have been key factors supporting gold’s ongoing rally. Why did gold, silver prices crash in the last few days? The steep rally in recent months encouraged investors to book profits in both metals, adding to the downward pressure on prices. Multiple factors have been linked to the recent sharp correction seen in both gold and silver. The immediate trigger was US President Donald Trump’s backing of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his preferred choice to replace current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Markets view Warsh as a policy hawk inclined toward stricter control over inflation and tighter monetary policy. The dollar strengthened against major global currencies, reducing the appeal of such assets and weakening the dollar-debasement narrative.

Keion White shot at San Francisco nightclub; Lil Baby was present before gunfire, police say

Super Bowl LX was supposed to be a night of celebration for San Francisco, but for 49ers defensive lineman Keion White, the party ended with a literal bang. Just hours after the Seattle Seahawks hoisted the trophy at Levi's Stadium on February 8, 2026, White found himself trading his jersey for a hospital gown after a heated confrontation at a club.Around 4:00 a.m. on Monday, February 9, Dahlia, a popular nightclub in San Francisco’s Mission District was buzzing with the usual post-Super Bowl energy and floors literally carpeted in dollar bills, according to police reports.White was hosting an exclusive, private party in the club’s basement. Enter rapper Lil Baby (Dominique Jones), who tried to crash the downstairs VIP section. What followed wasn't a friendly ""Who’s Who"" of the Bay Area, but a heated verbal sparring match between the 6'5"" lineman and the Grammy winner’s crew.As the argument reached a boiling point, the music was interrupted by two gunshots. White was struck in the left ankle, causing the crowd to scatter in what witnesses described as ""utter pandemonium.""When the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) arrived, they found a 9mm and a .45-caliber shell casing, evidence that at least two guns were in play. But here’s where it gets interesting, despite being the victim, Keion White has been famously ""uncooperative"" with investigators.When asked who pulled the trigger, White reportedly kept his lips sealed, sticking to a strict ""no-snitch"" code that has left police scrambling for surveillance footage to identify the shooter.The good news? White underwent successful surgery at San Francisco General Hospital, and the 49ers expect a full recovery before the 2026 season kicks off.As for Lil Baby, while he was physically present and involved in the argument, he has not been named a suspect or charged. For now, the shooter remains an ""unknown suspect"" lost in the sea of post-game revelry.It’s a bizarre, high-stakes reminder that sometimes the most dangerous hits don't happen on the turf, they happen after the clock hits zero.","49ers defensive lineman keion white was shot in the ankle at a san francisco nightclub.
