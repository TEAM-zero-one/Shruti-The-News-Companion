NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday welcomed the signing of a treaty between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius on the return of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia.In a press statement by the ministry of external affairs (MEA), India described the agreement as a milestone achievement and a positive development for the region.""We welcome the signing of the treaty between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius on the return of Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia. The formal resolution of the longstanding Chagos dispute through this bilateral treaty is a milestone achievement and a positive development for the region. This is further to the understanding between the two sides reached in October 2024, and marks the culmination of the process of decolonisation of Mauritius in the spirit of international law and rules-based order,"" the statement said.India has consistently supported Mauritius's legitimate claim over the Chagos Archipelago, reiterating its position on decolonisation, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.The statement added, ""India has consistently supported Mauritius's legitimate claim over the Chagos Archipelago in keeping with its principled position on decolonisation, respect for sovereignty, and the territorial integrity of nations. As a steadfast and longstanding partner of Mauritius, India remains committed to working closely with Mauritius and other like-minded countries to strengthen maritime security and regional stability and ensure peace and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region.""Earlier in March, foreign secretary Vikram Misri reaffirmed India's support for Mauritius on the Chagos sovereignty issue, stating, ""We have supported Mauritius in its stance on its sovereignty over Chagos. And this is obviously in keeping with our longstanding position with regard to decolonisation and support for sovereignty and territorial integrity of our other countries. And its only fitting for us to articulate this support for partners such as Mauritius. "" Misri emphasised that India had made substantial contributions to Mauritius's maritime safety and security, and highlighted ongoing technical and development cooperation.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's previous visit to Mauritius, several agreements were signed on enhancing maritime security, technical cooperation, ocean observation, and capacity building. India has provided vessels and assistance for maritime surveillance, and supports a range of projects from infrastructure to education, health, and the blue economy. ""These facilities have also been assisting Mauritius in its maritime surveillance and patrolling of its vast Exclusive Economic Zone and in safeguarding the assets of its blue economy ecosystem from traditional and non-traditional maritime challenges,"" Misri said.India reaffirmed its commitment to deepening its partnership with Mauritius and contributing to the peace and prosperity of the Indian Ocean region, in line with international law and support for decolonisation.","India welcomes uk-mauritius treaty on chagos, reaffirms support for sovereignty.

Amid Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigrants, the US Embassy in India has released a strong advisory warning Indian citizens that they could face a permanent ban on travelling to the US in future. ""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future,"" the post read.This is applicable to Indians who are traveling to the US on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc which have their own authorized period of stay.Immigration is the most contentious issue of the Donald Trump administration with the president making his intent clear on the very first day in the office in his first executive order. He targeted the Citizensip Clause of the 14th Amendment that granted US citizenship to almost everyone born on American soil. While the executive order is now facing legal hurdles, the administration id deporiting illegal immigrants, arresting them, encouraging them to self-deport.All foreign nations staying the in the US for over 30 days are now required to register with the federal government -- in a new immigration rule change.Two deportation cases involving Indians became very high profile in the last few months.

They should be more involved They should stay neutral Their involvement is unnecessary

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar pointed to the “extreme religious outlook” of Pakistan army chief Asim Munir that influenced the Pahalgam terrorists who killed 26 civilians on April 22 after identifying them by their faith."" ... It was triggered by a very barbaric terrorist attack in the Indian Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir where 26 tourists were murdered in front of their families after ascertaining their faith. And it was done in a way in which it was intended to harm tourism, which is the mainstay of the Kashmir economy and to create a religious discord deliberately, an element of religion was introduced,"" Jaishankar told Dutch broadcaster NOS.""And to understand that, you've got to also see that on the Pakistani side, you have a Pakistani leadership, especially the army chief, who's very driven by extreme religious outlook. So there is clearly some connect between, you know, the views that were expressed and the behavior that was done,"" he said.Just days before the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, now promoted to field marshal, stoked tensions by invoking the two-nation theory, the ideological foundation of Pakistan's creation.He urged Pakistani citizens to teach their children that they are ""different from Hindus"" and referred to Kashmir as Pakistan’s ""jugular vein"".Jaishankar also explained how the de-escalation unfolded following the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 26 civilians and prompted India’s Operation Sindoor.“Yes, we have a mechanism to talk to each other - a hotline,” he said. “On May 10, it was the Pakistani Army that first sent a message expressing readiness to stop firing, and we responded accordingly,” Jaishankar said.While Jaishankar acknowledged that several countries, including the United States, reached out during the crisis, he made it clear that the resolution was entirely bilateral, not mediated by any third party.""The US was in the United States,"" he remarked when asked about President Donald Trump’s claim of brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan.Jaishankar acknowledged that US secretary of state Rubio and vice president Vance had reached out during the conflict.“Rubio spoke with me, and Vance spoke with our Prime Minister. They shared their views, and they were in communication with both us and the Pakistani side — as were some Gulf nations and other countries,” he said.He explained that such outreach is expected during moments of high tension between two countries.“When two nations are engaged in a conflict, it’s natural for others around the world to call, express concern, and offer help,” he said.However, Jaishankar stressed that the actual cessation of hostilities was negotiated directly between India and Pakistan.“We made one thing very clear to everyone, not just the United States, that if Pakistan wanted to stop the firing, we needed to hear it directly from them. Their general had to call our general and make that clear. And that’s exactly what happened.”His remarks came shortly after Trump again claimed credit for ending the standoff, stating he had “settled it through trade”, a claim firmly rejected by the Indian government.","S jaishankar says pakistan army chief asim munir influenced the pahalgam terrorists.

How India rendered Turkish drones, Chinese missiles useless

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday said it expects Turkey and China, both countries with close ties to Pakistan, to urge Islamabad to end its support for cross-border terrorism. Addressing a question about India-Turkey relations, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, said that ""relations are built on the basis of sensitivities to each other’s concerns. ""Pakistan used Turkish drones and China-made missiles during its repeated attempts to escalate tensions after India's Operation Sindoor.""We expect Turkey to strongly urge Pakistan to end its support to cross-border terrorism and take credible and verifiable actions against the terror ecosystem it has harboured for decades. Relations are built on the basis of sensitivities to each other’s concerns,"" Jaiswal said during his weekly briefing.He also said that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval spoke to Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on May 10, days after India had launched Operation Sindoor targeting terror infrastrucutre in Pakistan and Pakistan-occuiped Kashmir. Jaiswal added that the NSA had conveyed to China ""India’s resolute stance against cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan"".""Our NSA and the Chinese Foreign Minister and Special Representative on Boundary Issue Wang Yi had spoken to each other on 10th May 2025, when NSA conveyed India’s resolute stance against cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.The Chinese side is well aware that mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity remain the basis of India-China relations,"" he said. During Operation Sindoor, India had successfully intercepted Turkish drones and Chinese missiles mid-air , nullifying the strategic advantage Pakistan had hoped to gain by deploying them in swarms.While the drones supplied to Pakistan by Turkiye were not of the same quality as it sends to Ukraine, it was significant that many were downed by lower-cost, Indian-made drones, dealing a symbolic blow to President Erdogan’s ambitions of regional Islamic leadership. Reflecting its frustration, Turkiye had sent only a junior representative to India’s post-operation briefing.India had also deployed Israeli Harop drones, so-called ""loitering munitions"" which lock onto targets and self-destruct on impact. These proved effective in disabling Pakistani air defences and critical military sites during the 7–10 May conflict.“Our integrated air defence (AD) systems stood like a wall and they (Pakistan) could not breach it. Whether it’s a Turkish drone or anything else, it fails in front of the technology of India,” said Air Marshal A K Bharti, Director General of Air Operations. “The sky remains ours,” he added, highlighting the effectiveness of India's relatively impregnable AD shield.During a joint briefing with Lt-General Rajiv Ghai and Vice Admiral A N Pramod , officials had presented evidence of Pakistan’s use of Chinese PL-15 long-range air-to-air missiles and Turkish-made Byker Yiha and Songar drones , most of which were shot down or neutralised by Indian systems. “Whenever Pakistan Air Force attacked us, it failed in front of our AD grid,” said Lt-Gen Ghai.","Pakistan used turkish drones and china-made missiles during its repeated attempts to escalate tensions after india's operation sindoor.

'Jab Sindoor Bana Barood...': PM Modi’s Powerful Message To Pakistan After Op Sindoor Strikes

Poll Should countries outside of India and Pakistan play a role in mediating their conflicts? Yes, they can help facilitate peace. No, it should be resolved bilaterally.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has firmly rejected US President Donald Trump's claims of brokering peace between India and Pakistan, asserting that the recent cessation of hostilities was achieved through direct communication between the two nations.In an interview with Netherlands-based NOS, Jaishankar detailed how the de-escalation actually occurred. ""Yes, we have a mechanism to talk to each other as a hotline. So, on the 10th of May, it was the Pakistani army which sent a message that they were ready to stop firing, and we responded accordingly.""This came after India launched "" Operation Sindoor ,"" in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 civilian lives. While acknowledging that various countries, including the US, reached out during the crisis, Jaishankar affirmed that the actual resolution was bilateral.""Well, the US was in the United States. Obviously, US Secretary of State Rubio and Vice President Vance had called up, Rubio had spoken to me, Vance had spoken to our Prime Minister, they had their view and they were talking to us and they were talking to Pakistani side as indeed were some other countries. There were some countries in the Gulf, there were some others as well,"" Jaishankar said.""That happens naturally, when we know when two countries are engaged in a conflict, it is natural that the countries in the world call up, sort of indicate their concern and what they can do in such a situation but the cessation of firing and military action was something which was negotiated directly between India and Pakistan.We made one thing very clear to everybody who spoke to us, not just the United States, but to everyone, saying look if the Pakistani want to stop the firing, they need to tell us, we need to hear it from them, their general has to call our general and say this and that is what happened,"" he added.Earlier today, Trump once again claimed credit for brokering India and Pakistan ceasefire stating that he ""settled it through trade"".""If you take a look at what we just did with Pakistan and India, we settled that whole thing, and I think I settled it through trade.

Okay, I accept that may not be the policy of the earlier government. But, our government is very clear, if there is such an attack, there will be response. The response was there, the response targeted these nine places, where the terrorist centres, as I said, they are all, the places are all shown in the UN list, I mean this is where the terrorists work and live and operate from,"" the EAM said.""After that, the Pakistani military chose to fire on us and we responded, this went on four days and after that, the decisive day was the 10th of May. On the morning of 10th May, in response to an attack which they had launched on us earlier that morning, we had hit eight airbases. We basically made these bases non-functional, you know, we hit their runways, we hit their command centres,"" he added.On May 7 India launched 'Operation Sindoor' targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir , eliminating over 100 terrorists from various groups including Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. Pakistan's subsequent retaliation led to crossborder shelling and attempted drone attacks, before both nations reached an understanding on May 10.Jaishankar asserted that while active hostilities have ceased, Operation Sindoor's strategic message remains: ""The operation continues because there is a clear message in that operation, that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22nd, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists. If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are.""(With ANI inputs)",Us president donald trump claimed credit for brokering peace between india and pakistan.

NEW DELHI: A soldier was killed in an encounter with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar on Thursday.""During the ongoing operation, fierce gunfight is continuing. One of our bravehearts sustained grievous injuries in the exchange of fire and has succumbed despite best medical efforts,"" White Knight Corps posted on X.Meanwhile, four terrorists are said to be trapped in the area as the operation continues in the Valley.Earlier, the officials said that joint security forces launched a cordon and search operation (CASO) after receiving specific intelligence about the presence of a group of three to four terrorists.“The cordon was tightened to engage the terrorists and to ensure that they are unable to escape. As the joint forces came closer, the hiding terrorists opened fire, triggering an encounter which is now going on. Three to four Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists are reported to be holed up,” an official told news agency IANS.Naming the operation “Op Trashi,” the White Knight Corps of the Indian Army said in a post on its X handle: “Contact has been established with #terrorists during a joint #operation with @JmuKmrPolice at #Chhatru, #Kishtwar today morning. Additional troops have been inducted, and operations are ongoing to neutralise the terrorists.”Joint forces have intensified operations against terrorists, their overground workers (OGWs), and sympathisers in Jammu and Kashmir.The operations intensified after April 22, when Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists segregated tourists based on religion and killed 26 civilians, including 25 tourists and a local resident, at the Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam.The cowardly terrorist act outraged the entire nation. In response, India launched Operation Sindoor by carrying out precision-guided strikes targeting terrorist infrastructure in Muridke near Lahore, Bahawalpur, Kotli, and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK).However, India agreed to pause the military operations after Pakistan reached out at the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) level for the ceasefire.Last Thursday, security forces shot dead three Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists during a gunfight in Tral area of south Kashmir, which was the second clash in the region in 48 hours after three Lashkar-e-Taiba men were killed.Terrorists Asif Ahmad Sheikh, Amir Nazir Wani, and Yawar Ahmad Bhat — all three Kashmir natives — were killed after forces launched an operation in Nader Tral based on intelligence inputs. Drones were deployed during the operation to locate hideouts.“Sharing such content can unintentionally promote extremist propaganda and may affect ongoing investigations,” a police spokesperson said. The public was also asked to stay away from the site.The Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, including local commander Shahid Kuttay, were killed on May 13 in Shopian.

PM Modi's stern warning to Pakistan



NEW DELHI: As India marks one month since the deadly Pahalgam terror attack , the series of events that unfolded since April 22, have dramatically altered the landscape of India-Pakistan relations and regional security dynamics.On April 22, Jammu and Kashmir witnessed one of the deadliest terror attacks in recent years when four terrorists of The Resistance Front,an offshoot of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, opened fire at point-blank range on tourists in the scenic Baisaran Valley, just 6 kilometres from the resort town of Pahalgam. The attack claimed 26 lives.The incident occurred on the same day that Prime Minister Narendra Modi departed for Saudi Arabia on an official visit, and US vice president JD Vance happened to be in India with family on a private trip.As soon as the news reached PM Modi, he cut short his Saudi visit and returned to New Delhi. Union home minister Amit Shah, without further ado, flew to Srinagar and later visited the attack site in Anantnag district to assess the situation and meet the victims' families.The attack set off a chain of unprecedented diplomatic and military actions between India and Pakistan, culminating in India's largest crossborder operation in recent years.On April 23, just a day after the terror strike, the central government suspended the long-standing Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)- a landmark 1960 water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan.The treaty regulates the use of six rivers in the Indus basin.The Indus River system includes the main Indus and six major tributaries. Five of these - the Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Chenab, and Jhelum - lie on the left bank, while the Kabul River is the only right-bank tributary. Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej are categorised as eastern rivers; Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab as western rivers. The Kabul River does not pass through Indian territory. The treaty had long been seen as a symbol of cooperation amid tense bilateral ties.In a retaliatory move, Pakistan announced a suspension of the 1972 Simla Agreement on April 24, along with all other bilateral accords with India - citing India's “non-adherence to international law, cross-border aggression, and fomenting terrorism inside Pakistan.”Pakistan’s Foreign Office declared that the agreements would remain suspended until India reverses its “aggressive behaviour.”The Indian Chargé d’Affaires in Islamabad was summoned to formally receive this notification.Speaking at a public rally in Madhubani, Bihar - his first after the Pahalgam attack- Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a strong statement, declaring, “We will identify, track, and punish every terrorist and their backers.” In a rare English remark, he added, “Every effort will be made to ensure justice. The entire nation stands united.”Following the breakdown of two key bilateral agreements, India went on high alert. Civil and military drills were ramped up along the India-Pakistan border.Blackouts were practiced in sensitive districts on Indo-Pak borders, and emergency preparedness drills were held at key infrastructure sites across the country.In the early hours of May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor, a bold and coordinated military operation targeting total 9 terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation was a direct response to the Pahalgam massacre.Utilising advanced weaponry, air-launched cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and long-range drones - India struck nine high-value terror hubs, including Muridke and Bahawalpur, the ideological and operational centres of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Pakistan retaliated with drone swarms and missile strikes, but India’s air defence systems successfully neutralised the threats, preventing significant damage or casualties.Drones were spotted over cities like Amritsar, Pathankot, Jammu, Srinagar, Jaisalmer, Jalandhar, Ferozepur.Daily briefings were conducted by foreign secretary Vikram Misri, flanked by Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh , to provide updates on the situation.In the days following the May 7 strikes, Pakistan continued airspace violations. India responded with precision airstrikes that reportedly destroyed 11 Pakistani airbases, including critical facilities - Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The Nur Khan Airbase, formerly PAF Chaklala, was a strategic nerve centre for Pakistan's Air Mobility Command.At a press conference, Air Marshal AK Bharti presented visual evidence of the destruction, said, “We have targeted the length and breadth of the adversary.”On May 10, after several days of crossborder hostilities, the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) of Pakistan called his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire. The agreement was accepted and formally announced that evening by foreign secretary Vikram Misri.However, the calm was short-lived. Pakistan violated the ceasefire soon after by launching new drone swarms, which were promptly intercepted and neutralised by Indian forces.US President Donald Trump claimed that the ceasefire was brokered by the United States. Since May 10, Trump has repeatedly taken credit for what he calls a ""peace agreement between two nuclear powers.""To consolidate international support, the Indian government has launched a massive diplomatic campaign beginning May 23, deploying seven all-party delegations to 25 key global capitals.A total of 51 political leaders, including sitting MPs and former ministers, and 8 former ambassadors are part of the outreach.These delegations are visiting nations including permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and other influential global players.This step by the Centre aims to present a united Indian stance against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and reaffirm the country's commitment to international peace and security.PM Modi, during a public rally in Rajasthan's Bikaner on Thursday, delivered a strong message on national security, counterterrorism, and India’s stance on Pakistan. Referring to the recent counterterror action under Operation Sindoor in retaliation of Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Pahalgam, he said India had given its armed forces a “free hand,” which led to a swift and decisive strike in early hours of May 7.“In response to the attacks on the 22nd, within just 22 minutes, our forces destroyed nine of the biggest terrorist bases,” PM Modi said. “The enemies of India, both within and outside, have now seen what happens when sindoor turns into gunpowder,” (jab sindoor barood ban jata hai, to kya nateeja hota hai.)","India marks one month since the deadly pahalgam terror attack.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in his first public address since the launch of Operation Sindoor , delivered a fierce message to Pakistan , declaring that ""not blood, but sindoor (vermilion) flows through my veins"" and warning that India’s enemies now know what happens when ""sindoor turns into gunpowder.""Speaking at a rally in Rajasthan's Bikaner on Thursday, PM Modi praised the armed forces for their swift and strategic response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. He said that in retaliation, India ""destroyed nine of Pakistan’s biggest terror hideouts in just 22 minutes.""“The world and the enemies of the country have seen what happens when sindoor turns into barood (gunpowder). Those out to wipe out sindoor were reduced to dust,” he said to loud applause.""Pakistan can never win a direct war against India. Whenever there has been a direct confrontation, Pakistan has had to face defeat again and again. That is why Pakistan has made terrorism a weapon to fight against India. This has been going on for several decades since independence. Pakistan spreads terror, kills innocent people, and tries to create an atmosphere of fear in India,"" PM Modi said.""But Pakistan forgot one thing, now Modi, the servant of Mother India, stands here firmly.Modi’s mind is calm, it remains cool, but blood runs hot. And in Modi's veins, it’s not blood that flows it’s hot, sacred sindoor,"" he said.The prime minister reiterated that India will no longer be restrained in its response to terrorism, saying that if India is attacked, ""a strong retaliation will follow, at a time and in a manner of the armed forces' choosing.""Reiterating his government's tough stance, PM Modi said: ""There will be neither trade nor talks with Pakistan. If talks happen, it will only be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.”He asserted that Pakistan can never win a direct war against India, and that is why it resorts to terrorism. “Every time they fight directly, they are defeated. So, they made terrorism their tool — but this time, they were met with fire,” he said.Taking a swipe at Pakistan PM Modi said that Pakistan's attempt to target the Nal airbase in Bikaner failed to cause any damage. In contrast, Pakistan’s Rahimyar Khan airbase was severely hit in India's retaliation.“No one knows when it will open again. It’s in the ICU,” PM Modi said.""Our government gave a free hand to all three forces. They laid such a trap that Pakistan was forced to go down on its knees,” he added.","Prime minister narendra modi delivered a fierce message to pakistan.

'Sleepless night': PM Modi's 'Tharoor' swipe at Congress

Repeat 'offender'?

NEW DELHI: For several times in the last few months we have heard the Congress ""distance"" itself from Shashi Tharoor 's remarks. But now, in an interesting turn of events, it appears that Shashi Tharoor is ""distancing"" himself from the Congress.The gap between Congress and Tharoor, that first appeared on the surface in February this year when the Thiruvananthapuram MP openly praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit, seems to have widened in the last few days. The government's move to nominate Tharoor for its global diplomatic outreach post Operation Sindoor, bypassing the Congress leadership, has perhaps brought the differences to a tipping point.Congress veteran P J Kurien's recent remark: ""If people suspect Tharoor is leaning towards the BJP, no one can blame them for thinking so"" sums up the visible strain in the relationship. It has raised the obvious question: Is Tharoor on his way out of the Congress?Well, we may not have a clear answer to this question right now. But there are enough hints to suggest that Congress and Tharoor are drifting apart.Here's what they had to say about each other after the latest round of stand-off trigerred by the government's nomination move.Tharoor, when asked about not being nominated by the party, said, ""My party leadership is entitled to its opinion of my abilities or lack thereof, and I think that is really for them to explain. I have absolutely no comment to make on that. I am honoured to have been entrusted with the responsibility, and I will fulfil that responsibility just as I have fulfilled every responsibility entrusted to me in my rather long working life, whether at the United Nations or in the Congress Party. ""When asked if the party was trying to insult him by releasing the names suggested by it for the delegation, Tharoor said that he cannot be insulted so easily. ""I know my worth,"" he asserted.Tharoor also echoed the government line and said ""To my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics. It's all to do with what our country has been through in recent times and the need for us to present a united front. It is a good reflection of national unity at a time when unity is important.""The Congress, unhappy with Tharoor's ready acceptance of the responsibility ignoring the party stand, said: ""There is a difference between being in the Congress and being of the Congress. The Congress is like the mighty Ganga, which has many tributaries… Some of them dry up and some get polluted.""That Shashi Tharoor and the Congress were not on the same page on several issues in the last few months was an open secret. There were several instances when Tharoor praised PM Modi 's policies without bothering much about the party line.""PM Modi's US visit has yielded some positive outcomes for the Indian people. I welcome the fact that there is now an agreement to have a negotiation for the next 9 months on trade and tariffs. It's far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian. We can't always speak only in terms of party interests. I am not a party spokesman. I am an MP elected by all the people of Thiruvananthapuram, and on that basis, I speak as a responsible stakeholder in Indian democracy.""""India's diplomatic approach had given the Prime Minister a unique position to hug both the president of Ukraine and the president of Moscow two weeks apart and be accepted in both places. I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one person in the parliamentary debate who actually criticised the Indian position at the time back in February 2022.""""India’s vaccine diplomacy during the Covid pandemic stands out from amid the horrors of that time as a powerful example of international leadership rooted in responsibility and solidarity. By delivering made-in-India vaccines to over 100 nations, India demonstrated its capacity to extend a helping hand when it mattered most. ""This initiative during the dark days of the Covid pandemic reinforced India’s standing as a force for good in the world, reflecting its humanitarian spirit and adding to the allure of its soft power. It carried the values of compassion, cooperation, and global partnership to the world, building goodwill, strengthening diplomatic ties, and elevating India’s global stature.""""Obviously, there was no full proof intelligence. There was some failure... But we have got the example of Israel, the world's best intelligence services according to everybody, which were taken by surprise on October 7, just two years ago. It seems to me, just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through and then demand accountability from the government. No country can ever have a foolproof 100 per cent intelligence.'Clearly, Tharoor's praise for PM Modi and his policies was not an one-off transgression, but a sustained campaign to perhaps send across some message to the Congress leadership. When pointed out that his remarks were at variance with the party's stand, Tharoor strongly defended his position.""For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it,"" Tharoor said in February when objections were raised to his praise for PM Modi's US trip.The differences between Congress and Tharoor were so obvious that Prime Minister Modi took swipes at the grand-old-party when he shared stage with the Thiruvananthapuram MP at a function in Kerala.In his address during the public event, PM Modi had said, ""I want to tell Chief Minister (Pinarayi Vijayan), you are a strong pillar of INDI alliance, Shashi Tharoor is also sitting here. Today's event is going to disturb the sleep of many.""When the translator failed to deliver the exact translation of Prime Minister's message from Hindi to Malayalam, PM Modi said, ""The message has gone wherever it has to go.""Interestingly, this is not the first time that Tharoor has landed in trouble with the Congress over his praise for PM Modi. In February 2015, Tharoor had called PM Modi ""master communicator at work.""""In the Prime Minister, we are all seeing a master communicator at work. The Prime Minister is very effective in speech-making, comes up with slogans, sound bites, photo ops in quite an unparalleled way,"" Tharoor had then said.Tharoor's repeated praise for Modi then had prompted Kerala Congress to remind him that he had been elected on a Congress ticket. The state unit had then warned Tharoor of disciplinary action if he kept on lauding Modi's initiatives.When Kerala Congress objected to Tharoor's endorsement of PM Modi's ""Swachh Bharat"" campaign, Tharoor had said that it did not mean that he even remotely endorsed the BJP's ""core Hindutva"" agenda and that he continued to be a ""proud Congressman"".""I am astonished that anyone would suggest that I am pro-BJP. I have a 30-year paper trail of published writings on my idea of India and my profound belief in India's pluralism,"" Tharoor had then said in a Facebook comment.""Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party's core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short, not pro-BJP, just pro-India,"" the former UN diplomat had said.In 2015, Tharoor was clearly defensive about his views and statements which were at variance with the party. 10 years later, he appears to be aggressive about his stand and has justified his views. So, the question is: ""Is Shashi Tharoor now forcing his way out of the Congress?"" Well, we will have to wait and see how this saga unfolds.","Congress veteran p j kurien's recent remark: ""if people suspect tharoor is leaning towards the bjp, no one can blame them for thinking so"" sums up the visible strain in the relationship. There are enough hints to suggest that congress and throor are drifting apart. ""to my mind, this has nothing to do with party politics.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121321736,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45454,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In an interview in the Netherlands, Jaishankar said the fighting with Pakistan was halted after its army sent a message saying it's ready to stop firing, and India responded accordingly.The rejection of Trump's mediation claim for the first time at the political level followed repeated doubling down by Trump and his team that he brought the conflict to an end by forcing a ceasefire. Asked where the US was during the negotiations, EAM S Jaishankar said ""in the United States"", driving home his point that it wasn't American intervention that led to a pause.""They (vice-president Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio) were talking to us and to Pakistanis as indeed were other countries. The US was not alone. When there is a conflict, it's natural for countries to call up and indicate their concerns..., but the cessation of firing was something negotiated directly between India and Pakistan. We told everybody that if Pakistanis want to stop firing, their general has to call us and say that.And that's what happened,"" Jaishankar said. He added that India is ready to discuss issue of terrorism with Pakistan and reiterated New Delhi's point on the Kashmir issue that it will only negotiate the return of POK to India.Jaishankar said Operation Sindoor continues because of its clear message that if there are more terror acts like Pahalgam, India will hit terrorists. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan we will hit them where they are... So, there is a message in continuing the operation but continuing the operation is not the same as firing on each other,"" he said.On the religious profiling of Pahalgam attack victims, Jaishankar said, ""Pakistani leadership, especially their army chief, is driven by an extreme religious outlook... So, there is clearly some connect between the views that were expressed and the behaviour that was done.""Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, too, had earlier drawn a link between the religious profiling by terrorists and Pakistan army chief Asim Munir's anti-India speech on April 16 in which he had stressed the differences between Hindus and Muslims.The minister warned against falling for the narrative that Pakistan does not know what is going on. ""Most notorious terrorists on UN sanctions list are in Pakistan. They operate in big cities, in daylight. Their addresses are known. Their activities are known. Their mutual contacts are known. So let's not pretend that Pakistan is not involved. The state is involved. The army is up to its neck in it,"" he added.","S jaishankar said the cessation of military action was negotiated directly between new delhi and islamabad.

Poll What is the key factor in preventing espionage and terror attacks? Proactive intelligence operations Strong legal action and prosecution

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies dismantled a high-stakes espionage ring in a meticulously planned three-month-long covert operation, dealing a significant blow to ISI's attempts to carry out a terrorist strike in the national capital. The operation culminated in the arrest of two highly trained individuals, including Ansarul Miya Ansari , a Pakistani operative tasked with gathering sensitive information about Indian armed forces, sources said.The probe also points a finger of suspicion at some staffers of Pak High Commission in Delhi. It's suspected that ISI officers Muzammil and Ehsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish who had been cultivating Indian Youtubers and influencers were in on the plot.The operation kicked off with a vague tip in Jan that a spy had been dispatched by ISI to collect sensitive documents/pictures/Google coordinates and was to arrive in Delhi via Nepal. The sleuths then developed the tip which revealed that an attack in Delhi was being planned and classified information about the armed forces was to be used to plan a terror attack.Despite the high stakes, intelligence officials had to wait till mid-Feb to make headway.The ISI agent had arrived in Delhi and had collected confidential military documents, sources said. The trap was set, and on Feb 15, Ansari was apprehended in central Delhi with sensitive documents while he was on his way back to Pakistan via Nepal.The operation, sources said, was a masterclass in espionage craft, with the agency officials staying one step ahead of the spy at every turn. ""Our men were making efforts to collect information about Pak-backed terror outfits active in different parts of India and sleeper cells providing logistic support to them. After some grenade attacks outside police establishments in Punjab were carried out by ISI-backed terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa Internation (BKI), the agency suspected a larger plot to threaten public safety in north-western India,"" said the source.""In view of this, proactive steps were taken to prevent any such planning of terror attack in Delhi-NCR. Sources were activated which culminated in the tip about this suspect's travel plans.""Ansari was subsequently handed over to the police who then booked him for possessing and attempting to supply confidential documents related to the Indian Armed Forces to his Pakistani handlers. An FIR under the Officials Secrets Act was registered.The investigation also uncovered the role of Akhlaque Azam, a resident of Ranchi, who was providing logistic support to Ansarul in India. The two were in constant communication with their Pakistani handlers, and their conversations were laced with suspicion and intrigue, sources said. Azam was subsequently arrested in March.The analysis of their mobile devices uncovered suspicious conversations between both the arrested accused and their Pakistani handlers, which suggested a larger conspiracy. A few days ago, a chargesheet was filed in court against the two suspects even as further investigation is underway to identify more individuals involved in the conspiracy.But who was Ansari? A deep dive into his background revealed a complex web of deceit and radicalisation. During interrogation, Ansari revealed that he originally belonged to Nepal but had been living and working as a taxi driver in Qatar since 2008, where he was recruited by an ISI operative. Money was the first incentive and the brainwashing about the 'bigger cause' followed. He was asked to go to Pakistan and meet his handler in Rawalpindi.""In June 2024, he visited Pakistan for a month, where he was introduced to high-ranking officials of the Pakistani Army and radicalised by discussing issues like the Babri Masjid demolition and the implementation of CAA/NRC in India. Ansari was also trained in espionage and tasked with procuring secret documents from Delhi,"" a report filed in court reads.The trial is about commence shortly with the court having taken cognisance of the chargesheet. The two arrested men are lodged in high security wing of Tihar jail. A special watch is being kept over them so that they may not attempt to brainwash other inmates, sources said. ""We are on high alert to prevent any threats to national security. It may be a cat-and-mouse game, but India's agencies want to be the ones holding the reins,"" said a top officer who didn't wish to be named.","Sleuths stay one step ahead of spy at every turn.
