NEW DELHI: The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) on Wednesday raised serious concerns over the preliminary findings and public commentary surrounding the crash of Air India Flight AI171, which went down in Ahmedabad shortly after takeoff en route to London.In an official statement, the FIP said, ""We register our dissatisfaction with the exclusion of pilot representatives from the investigation process. We also firmly object to how the preliminary report has been interpreted and presented publicly.""The federation criticised the report for lacking comprehensive data and relying heavily on ""selectively paraphrased cockpit voice recordings"" that appear to imply pilot error and question the competence of the flight crew. ""This approach is neither objective nor complete,"" the FIP said, urging members and the public not to draw conclusions prematurely.""Assigning blame before a thorough, transparent, and data-driven investigation is both premature and irresponsible. Such speculative commentary undermines the professionalism of highly trained crew members and causes undue distress to their families and colleagues,"" the statement added.The 15-page preliminary report, released a month after the crash, outlines initial findings from the accident that claimed 240 lives out of the 241 people on board.

NEW DELHI: Reminiscing 'Sholay' in times of conflict, the Consulate General of Iran in Mumbai Tuesday took to X (formerly Twitter) to post about an Iranian newspaper's coverage on the iconic Bollywood film awaiting its 50th anniversary.The Iranian embassy joined in, posting ""Sholay turns 50 and Iran still remembers."" While this nostalgic tribute highlighted the film's timeless appeal and cross-cultural resonance transcending borders, the gesture was also pleasantly surprising at a time when the country is recovering from a war.'Sholay' was released on Aug 15, 1975, when India was under the Emergency.The Consulate General's post recalled how an Iranian newspaper dedicated a full-page tribute to 'Sholay', noting that the film's unforgettable story of friendship has become a cornerstone of cinematic memory in Iran. Interestingly, the iconic villain Gabbar Singh is known as Jabbar Singh in Iran. The post also mentioned Iranian actor Navid Mamza, who drew inspiration from Gabbar Singh's looks and menacing mannerisms.This gesture is significant given the historical and cultural ties between India and Iran. The two countries enjoyed a long-standing relationship rooted in their shared border until India's partition in 1947.Indian cinema has been a common thread between the two nations, with films like 'Shree 420' and 'Sangam' gaining immense popularity in Iran. Raj Kapoor's visit to Iran for the premiere of Shree 420 was met with a grand welcome, with fans showering him with affection.A newsletter on the website of the Hinduja group - which played a role in the film's distribution in Tehran - quotes SP Hinduja saying that it was the eldest of Hinduja siblings, Girdhar, based in Iran in the 1950s, who came up with the idea of promoting Indian films in Iran.

Poll How do you view India’s latest step in human spaceflight? A proud milestone in our space journey A stepping stone to greater ambitions like Gaganyaan

Re-entry & splashdown

Recovery operations

Learning For Gaganyaan

With Grace’s gentle splash into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego at 3.02 pm (IST) on Tuesday, Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) ended his mission, wrapping up months of training, experiments in orbit, and India’s latest stride in human spaceflight participation.When Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma soared into space aboard a Soviet spacecraft in April 1984, Shux wasn’t even born. It would be another year and a half before he entered the world. Forty-one years later, Shux’s Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission comes at a time India is making a deeper entry into human spaceflight, expanding ambitions beyond satellites and rockets.And this hasn’t escaped Shux, who in his last speech from the International Space Station (ISS), had said: “As this journey completes… India’s human spaceflight journey is both long and challenging. But I assure you, if we decide, even the stars are attainable.”PM Modi, while welcoming Shux back, said as India’s first astronaut to the ISS, he has inspired a billion dreams through his dedication, courage and pioneering spirit. “...It marks another milestone towards our own Human Space Flight Mission - Gaganyaan ,” the PM said.Grace, the Dragon capsule carrying Shux, mission commander Peggy Whitson, mission specialists Tibor Kapu and Slawosz Uznanski, had undocked from the ISS at 4.45 pm Monday.As part of the re-entry and splashdown operations, around 2.07 pm on Tuesday, Grace began the 18-minute de-orbit burn, and by 2.27 pm, Grace jettisoned the trunk (with solar panels and radiators), and the nose cone was closed by 2.33 pm.Around 2.57 pm, Grace deployed the drogue parachutes and about a minute later, the four main parachutes got deployed at an altitude of 1,000 metres. In a three-minute operation, these parachutes together reduced Grace’s velocity from 563kmph to 23kmph as altitude dropped to 800m, 600m and 400m, before the splashdown.At 3.07 pm, Peggy radioed to mission control that the crew was ready for recovery and by 3.10 pm, the recovery boats reached Grace. The recovery personnel, wearing PPE suits, first checked for hazardous gases around Grace before beginning rigging the capsule at 3.15 pm, as flight surgeons stood by for the initial medical tests to be conducted.Between 3.29 pm and 3.30 pm, Grace was nested on recovery ship “Shannon”, when the recovery teams began some routine leak checks and de-rigging and ensured it was safe for the crew to egress or exit from the side hatch.By 3.37 pm Grace was being moved from its initial place on Shannon to a deck where the crew was expected to be recovered. Between 3.40 pm and 3.41 pm, the recovery personnel opened the side hatch and began preparations to allow the crew to egress.At 3.49 pm, Peggy slid out of the capsule with a smile, followed by Shux at 5.52 pm and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski and Tibor Kapu in the next couple of minutes. The crew was then taken to land by a helicopter. Following medical checks, they will be taken to Houston for de-briefing and other procedures.Just as Shux, Isro too has acknowledged the importance of the mission that has cost India Rs 548 crore. “...Ax-4 is one small step in orbit, but a giant leap in India’s pursuit of human spaceflight and scientific discovery,” the agency had said post-launch.Isro chairman V Narayanan, while stressing that learning outcomes — spanning astronaut training (for two), mission operations, and hardware-software-human interface — cannot be measured purely in monetary terms, had told TOI that benefits from Ax-4 far outweigh the cost.Indian Space Association director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt said: “This is a stepping stone for India’s future crewed space journeys, including Gaganyaan and goals of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. It’ll not only support Isro but also give impetus to both global and Indian private space industries.”Satcom Industries Association-India president Subba Rao Pavuluri, echoing Bhatt’s views, said: “...While our ancestors explored Planets with intuition, we’ll be exploring planets with experimentation and going there. Shukla’s mission is the first step to realise ‘Bharat’s Space ambitions’ .”Also read | Minister Jitendra Singh: India has found a lasting space in world of space; hints at Shubhanshu Shukla's India return","Shubhanshu shukla returns safely, next mission: helping gaganyaan.

NEW DELHI: The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has busted an ISI-China-Canada linked international drug cartel and arrested a notorious Indo-Canadian gangster, Opinder Singh Sian aka Thanos, running a global fentanyl and methamphetamine trafficking ring from British Columbia.According to court documents reviewed by TOI, Sian was arrested in Arizona on June 27 after his role in smuggling methamphetamine to Australia and chemicals for fentanyl into the US via Canada was established.The investigation, which kicked off in 2022, and a recently unsealed affidavit in a US court, has revealed that Sian, had operational ties with chemical suppliers linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) besides the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico.The DEA had mounted an undercover operation to trap Sian after his dubious ties came to fore in 2021-2022 in the aftermath of a preliminary inquiry conducted regarding a tip from a Turkish intelligence agency.Singh was at the time a known senior member of the notorious ISI-backed 'Brothers Keepers' gang which mostly has foot soldiers from Punjab in India, many of whom are Canadian citizens.The gang, which has lent its support to the cause of so-called Khalistan on many occasions, was also seen active in commemorations rallies in support of Air India bombing mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar and others, sources said.According to Canadian police, the group deals in bulk trafficking of cocaine, MDMA, heroin, fentanyl and methamphetamine besides arms trafficking, murder, extortion and armed robbery.In his early days, Sian was wounded in a shooting in Aug 2008 that left his friend Gurpreet Sidhu dead and survived another bid on his life in May 2011, marking his rapid rise in Canada's underworld. The now-released court documents state that Sian had arranged for a meeting between a confidential US undercover source, known as ""Queen"", and a Chinese cartel man named Peter Peng Zhou in Vancouver in 2023. Zhou, ran a trucking company with an Indo-Canadian associate, revealed that he could ""receive fentanyl precursor chemicals from China into Vancouver and ""send 100 kilos of chemicals per month to Los Angeles"" using his trucking company.Sian and Queen, the DEA said, held multiple meetings and were in contact through chat application Threema to coordinate multiple deliveries. Specifically, Sian made four drops of methamphetamine (over 500 pounds) in southern California before the DEA moved for his arrest.The DEA agents were subsequently able to identify multiple characters involved in the network, which ranged from Turkey to Dubai. Sian, the DEA submitted, was also found linked to the notorious Kinahan crime family which is linked to Hezbollah",The us drug enforcement agency (dea) has busted an isi-china-canada linked international drug cartel.

Poll Do you believe that India's military should focus on developing indigenous weapons technology? Yes, it's essential for national security. No, we should rely more on imported technology.

NEW DELHI: Chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday said India cannot win modern wars with outdated weapons, stressing the need to adopt future-ready technology, with a focus on indigenous weapons. The CDS also offered new insights into Operation Sindoor , describing how India successfully thwarted Pakistan’s use of drones and loitering munitions without sustaining any damage.Speaking at a defence workshop in Delhi, Chauhan said, “During Operation Sindoor, on 10th May, Pakistan used unarmed drones and loitering munitions. None of them inflicted any damage to the Indian military or civil infrastructure. Most were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means, and some were even recovered in almost intact condition.”“Yesterday’s weapons can’t win today’s wars, tomorrow’s technology is needed to fight today’s battles,” he said, as reported by PTI.""Can't rely on imported niche tech crucial for our missions; dependence on foreign tech weakens preparedness,"" the CDS further added.Operation Sindoor was India’s military response to the Pahalgam terror attack and involved airstrikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK).India also repelled subsequent aggression and targeted Pakistani airbases.Chauhan also addressed the strategic use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the need to develop indigenous counter-drone technologies.“When we talk about drones, what do you think these are — are they bringing an evolutionary change or a revolutionary change in warfare?” he said. “I think their development is evolutionary and their employment has been very revolutionary in warfare. As the realisation of their deployment and scope increased, the Army started using drones in a revolutionary manner — you have seen this in a number of wars fought by us. ”Chauhan was speaking at a workshop and exhibition titled ‘Indigenisation of critical components currently being imported from foreign OEMs in the areas of UAV & C-UAS’, organised by the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff and the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.Highlighting the broader historical shift in warfare, Chauhan added, “Evolutionary changes have made weapons and war fighting equipment smaller, faster, lighter, more efficient, more affordable… We had large, weighty rifles; now they are shorter, lighter, with longer ranges. The same applies to tanks and aircraft — they are now lighter, faster, and offer greater protection.”Also Read: India’s Operation Sindoor not just a warning to Pakistan, but a signal to the world about India’s military strength, says international security expert John Spencer A defence ministry statement had said the event aims to align with India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and is expected to produce a strategic policy document focused on indigenisation. Chauhan’s remarks reinforced the urgent need to build indigenous systems suited to Indian terrain.""Recognising the importance of reducing the dependency on OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for critical UAV and C-UAS components, the upcoming workshop-cum-exhibition aims to bring together all relevant stakeholders, including defence experts, policymakers, military leaders, scientists, and private industry, to develop a strategic roadmap for indigenisation,"" the ministry said.","Chief of defence staff general anil chauhan said india cannot win modern wars with outdated weapons.

'Committed To Peace': Pak Calls for Dialogue With India at SCO After Pahalgam Attack, Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Stressing on acquiring the most advanced but indigenous defence technologies to have an upper hand over adversaries, chief of defence staff general Anil Chauhan said that “in today’s warfare, you cannot win with yesterday’s weapon systems”. “Today's warfare has to be fought with tomorrow’s technology,” he said.The CDS advocated for accelerated development of homegrown drone technology and counter-UAS grids, cautioning that outdated technology cannot be relied upon in modern battlefields.In his address at an event held at the Manekshaw Centre in Delhi, CDS Chauhan also pointed out that during Operation Sindoor, Pakistan had used unarmed drones and loiter munitions on May 10 but “none of them could actually inflict any damage to Indian military or civilian infrastructure, and most of them were neutralised through a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic means”.Laying stress on self-reliance in drone and UAV technology, he said, “Our 'Operation Sindoor' has shown us why we must not depend on imported drone or counter-drone technology. Indigenous systems are critical. Foreign systems come with limitations — their specifications are widely known, allowing adversaries to anticipate tactics.”Gen Chauhan said recent conflicts globally have demonstrated how drones can “shift tactical balance disproportionately”.Asserting that self-reliance in UAVs and Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) is a “strategic imperative” for India, he said Operation Sindoor has shown why indigenously developed Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and C-UAS “built for our terrain and our needs are crucial”. “Asymmetric drone warfare is making large platforms vulnerable and driving militaries to rethink the conceptual aspects of air doctrines, development of C-UAS and adaptive moves of engagement,” he said.“In the history of warfare, we have witnessed revolutionary changes — from heavy rifles to lighter, more sophisticated long-range weapons. But the biggest shift is the emergence of drones and unarmed aerial systems. Their utility has grown multifold — from basic surveillance tools to becoming effective force multipliers on the battlefield,” Gen Chauhan said.He explained that drones, despite being smaller and less aerodynamic, are reshaping conventional warfare. “They are cheaper, harder to detect and yet sophisticated. This defies traditional military thinking,” he said. Operation Sindoor, he said, clearly demonstrated the need to secure lower airspace and develop integrated counter-UAV systems.His statement comes amid a global shift towards drone-dominated conflicts, like in the case of the Israel-Iran conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war, where hundreds of drones are being used for bombing strategic targets, individuals and even key installations.","Can’t win today's warfare with yesterday’s weapons, desi drone tech must: cds general anil chauhan.

Poll Should the Indian government take stronger measures against Pakistan-based terrorist organizations? Yes, absolutely Diplomacy should be the focus

NEW DELHI: The April 22 terrorist attack in J&K’s Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, was a closely guarded conspiracy hatched by Pakistan spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) on the directions of the country’s political and military brass, and executed exclusively by Pakistani terrorists , according to sources in the security establishment.In what sources described as an LeT-ISI joint project akin to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) gave specific directions to Pakistan-based Lashkar commander Sajid Jutt to deploy only foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings in Pahalgam’s Baisaran valley. To ensure complete secrecy, no Kashmiri terrorists were taken on board, and instead, LeT foreign terrorists operating in J&K for sometime were told to execute the killings while ensuring minimal local involvement on a “need-to-know” basis.The Pahalgam attack squad was led by Sulaiman, a suspected former Pakistani special forces commando, who had trained at the LeT Muridke hub in Pakistan’s Punjab province before crossing the LoC in 2022 with his M-4 weapon to enter the Jammu region. Two other Pakistani terrorists were members of the squad.Satellite phone analysis has revealed that Sulaiman’s location on April 15 was in Tral forest, indicating he was in the vicinity of the attack site at Baisaran for almost a week before the incident.Sulaiman was also involved in the April 2023 attack on an Army truck in Poonch, in which five soldiers were killed. However, he laid low for the next two years, before carrying out the ISI-LeT mission. Sources did not reveal the identities of the two other Pakistani terrorists who selectively gunned down the 26 civilians — all men and 25 of them being Hindus.Even though the J&K Police had earlier suspected the role of Pakistani terrorists Hashim Musa and Ali Bhai, probe has only confirmed Sulaiman’s role till now. There is no corroboration of the role of local Kashmiri terrorist Adil Hussain Thoker as a facilitator, either.“No local terrorist had participated in the gruesome killing or was in the loop on exact details of the terror plot,” a senior official told TOI. Even the two locals arrested by the NIA in the case last month — Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar from Batkote, Pahalgam, and Bashir Ahmad Jothar from Hill Park, Pahalgam — are believed to have had a limited role, having provided the armed Pakistani terrorists food, shelter and other logistics in return for a few thousand rupees. They have also denied any knowledge of the terrorists’ plan to hit tourists in Baisaran.The attack in Baisaran was unexpected as terrorists are not known to target tourists in the Kashmir Valley. The area where the attack took place is an open meadow. There was no facility or room for security forces to be present there. Tourists had started visiting Baisaran only three days before the incident after rains stopped. The J&K Tourism Development Corporation had leased the site for three years to a private operator, but full payment had not been received. Hence, all necessary permissions had not been given to open up the site to tourists.There are currently about 68 foreign terrorists and three local terrorists active in the Valley. Only one local terror recruitment has been reported so far this year.","The april 22 terrorist attack in j&k’s pahalgam claimed the lives of 26 civilians.

Samantha Ponder Breaks Her Silence Since ESPN Firing (FIRST Interview) | The Sage Steele Show

More than a year after her unexpected exit from ESPN, former NFL Countdown host Sam Ponder is finally sharing the behind-the-scenes truth—and it’s nothing like the “budget cuts” explanation viewers were fed in 2023. In a candid appearance on The Sage Steele Show, Ponder claimed that her support for female athletes and her cautious views on transgender participation in women’s sports led to internal pushback, quiet censorship, and ultimately, her departure.The tipping point came in July 2023, when Ponder retweeted a video of Paula Scanlan—a former teammate of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas—sharing her experience at UPenn. Ponder’s comment was mild: she simply encouraged followers to “listen.” But that act alone sparked a warning from a higher-up at ESPN. She recalled receiving a private email urging her not to “misgender people,” which she interpreted as a veiled threat. “I knew I was on the clock,” Ponder admitted.The network reportedly flagged more of her online activity, including a “liked” tweet from Megyn Kelly joking that “men don’t need gynecologists.”Ponder didn’t think it was controversial. “It was just a favorite,” she said. “I didn’t think that was a big deal.”While ESPN cited cost-cutting as the official reason behind her departure—lumping her in with figures like Robert Griffin III—Ponder believes her limited role on Sunday NFL Countdown wasn’t actually draining company resources. Instead, she feels her open support for female athletes like Riley Gaines made her an internal liability.She even mentioned avoiding coverage of Gaines during Women's History Month out of fear of backlash. “I knew I was supposed to talk about Riley,” Ponder confessed. “But I didn’t.”Despite the fallout, Ponder doesn’t feel bitter. She called her firing “one of the best things that’s ever happened” to her, saying, “I was on the hamster wheel. I wasn’t going to jump off on my own.” Her final message was clear: “I wasn’t trying to be controversial. I just wanted people to hear stories I wasn’t seeing on SportsCenter.”Also Read: Joy Taylor’s FOX Sports scandal: Everything about the backstage drama, show cancellations, and lawsuit that led to her exit With the debate around inclusion in women’s sports only growing louder, Ponder’s revelations have reignited a culture war ESPN may not be able to sidestep much longer.",Former nfl countdown host sam ponder was fired from espn in 2023.

A 7.3-magnitude earthquake jolted the coast of the US state of Alaska on Wednesday, prompting a tsunami warning , as per the US Geological Survey (USGS).The earthquake struck at approximately 12:37 pm local time (2037 GMT), with its epicentre located about 54 miles (87 km) south of Sand Point, near Popof Island, at the centre of the Alaska Peninsula.The depth was recorded at 20.1 km, making it a relatively shallow quake, which can often be more damaging.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami warning for an area covering much of the Alaska Peninsula and extending into the southernmost portion of mainland Alaska, reaching toward Anchorage.According to the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) in Palmer, Alaska, “a tsunami has been confirmed and some impacts are expected.” The warning specifically applied to the Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance (40 miles southwest of Homer) to Unimak Pass (80 miles northeast of Unalaska).Based on initial assessments, tsunami warnings were not issued for regions beyond Alaska, the NTWC added.A major earthquake is considered to have a magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9 and is capable of causing serious damage. On average, about 10 to 15 such strong earthquakes are recorded globally each year.Alaska lies on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and has experienced powerful quakes in the past. The most significant was a 9.2-magnitude earthquake in March 1964, the strongest ever recorded in North America, which devastated Anchorage and triggered a tsunami that hit the US West Coast and Hawaii, killing over 250 people.In July 2023, a 7.2-magnitude quake had also struck off the Alaska Peninsula, though no major damage was reported then.","The earthquake struck at approximately 12:37 pm local time (2037 gmt) its epicentre was 54 miles (87 km) south of sand point, near popof island.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s divorce shocked fans, but one symbol sparked lasting controversy—the MAGA hat in Brady’s locker. As speculation swirled linking Donald Trump to their split, Bündchen finally addressed the rumors in a revealing interview, offering emotional clarity on what really ended their 13-year high-profile marriage.Back in 2015, a red “Make America Great Again” hat quietly sitting in Tom Brady’s locker triggered a wave of controversy that would follow the NFL icon for years. As Donald Trump’s presidential campaign gained momentum, Brady’s casual display of support—paired with public comments calling Trump a “good friend”—sparked heated debate among fans and media.But after Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce in October 2022, nearly a decade into a marriage that once looked like a fairy tale, the MAGA moment resurfaced once again. Online speculators claimed the quarterback’s ties to Trump may have contributed to the couple’s split. However, in a 2023 Vanity Fair interview, Bündchen finally addressed the issue—and made it clear the narrative had spun far from reality.Speaking candidly about her divorce, the Brazilian supermodel became emotional when reflecting on their 13-year marriage. “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” she said, tearing up.But when asked directly if Trump or the MAGA hat incident played any role in the split, she didn’t hesitate to shut it down: “Never.”Her answer not only challenged the popular theory but also offered a rare glimpse into the deeply personal nature of the couple’s separation. The truth, as Bündchen explained, was far more human and less political. “You give a hundred percent of yourself, and it’s heartbreaking when it doesn’t end up the way you hoped for… but you can only do your part.”Despite being one of the highest-paid models in the world, Bündchen had stepped away from the runway in 2015 to prioritize family life. She poured herself into their home, their children, and Brady’s relentless football career. Though the marriage eventually ended, she harbors no resentment.“Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever,” she said warmly. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him… I want him to achieve and to conquer.”Also Read: Is Tom Brady quietly backing Donald Trump?

Veteran NHL analyst John Shannon has weighed in firmly on the swirling trade rumors involving Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby. Appearing on the Sekeres & Price podcast, Shannon made his stance crystal clear: he does not believe a Crosby trade is on the table.

The veteran broadcaster and former Hockey Night in Canada executive emphasized that despite ongoing rumors, there is no realistic scenario where Crosby is moved.Shannon’s dismissal of the trade chatter is a major statement given the growing uncertainty in Pittsburgh.

Goldman Sachs to the halls of power: Rishi Sunak’s journey from finance to political leadership



Leading the UK through crisis

A return to finance, but with a new mission

The full circle of a modern career





Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ’s latest career move surprised many. After serving as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister during one of its most turbulent periods, he is now returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. This is the very firm where his professional journey in finance began more than two decades ago.“Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of COVID still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilized energy markets and supply chains over the world.”I pledge to govern with integrity, professionalism, and accountability, and promise, “Trust is earned, and I will earn yours.”Said Rishi Sunak, as he took oath as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 25 October 2022, under looming clouds of uncertainty, and water as well, outside 10 Downing Street, London.Now, two and a half years later, Rishi Sunak prepares to return to the private sector as a senior adviser at Goldman Sachs, the very firm where his journey in finance began.From a young investment banker at Goldman, to leading the UK through political and economic turbulence, and now rejoining the financial world, Sunak’s path has come full circle, blending boardrooms, ballots, and comeback at Goldman Sachs.Rishi Sunak’s early career was rooted firmly in finance.After graduating from Oxford and Stanford, he joined Goldman Sachs as a summer intern and then worked as an analyst from 2001 to 2004. This experience gave him a foundation in global markets and investment banking, skills that would later shape his approach to economic policy. However, Sunak’s ambitions extended beyond finance. He entered politics, winning the Richmond parliamentary seat in 2015. His rise was rapid, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he managed the UK’s economic response to the COVID-19 crisis. His leadership during this period was widely noted for balancing fiscal support with a commitment to economic stability.Now, as he re-enters the private sector, many will watch to see how Sunak’s unique blend of political insight and financial expertise influences Goldman Sachs’ global strategy. His move also raises broader questions about the crossover between public leadership and corporate influence in a post-pandemic world.Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister in October 2022 following the resignation of Liz Truss, whose short-lived premiership collapsed under the weight of economic turmoil triggered by her government’s mini-budget. As the Conservative Party scrambled to restore stability, Sunak was chosen as a unifying candidate and became the party leader unopposed.When Sunak became Prime Minister, the UK was grappling with a profound economic crisis. The pandemic’s aftershocks still reverberated through public health and the economy, while war in Ukraine had disrupted energy supplies and global trade. Sunak’s government faced soaring inflation, energy price shocks, and political instability. His promise to govern with integrity and accountability was tested daily. Despite the challenges, he sought to restore confidence both at home and abroad, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and international cooperation.Despite efforts to stabilize markets and promote fiscal responsibility, Sunak struggled to unite a deeply fractured Conservative Party. Mounting internal tensions, declining public support, and a series of backbench rebellions eventually eroded his authority. In July 2024, facing mounting pressure and a leadership challenge, Sunak announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader, bringing his tenure as Prime Minister to an end.Rishi Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser is notable not only because it marks a return to his roots but also because of the role’s unique nature. He will advise clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, drawing on his extensive experience in government and global affairs. Importantly, Sunak will not receive a salary for this position. Instead, any earnings will be donated to the Richmond Project, a charity he co-founded to promote numeracy and education in his constituency. This arrangement reflects a commitment to public service even as he re-engages with the private sector.Rishi Sunak’s comeback to the private sector is not just a career move; it’s an inspiring example of how public service can continue even after leaving office. Unlike many politicians who often retire into comfort, relying on accumulated wealth or government benefits, Sunak is choosing to re-engage professionally in a meaningful way. His decision to take on an advisory role at Goldman Sachs without drawing a salary, and instead donating any earnings to charity, reflects both integrity and a deep sense of responsibility. It sets a strong precedent for how former leaders can remain active contributors to society, not for personal gain, but for a greater public good.Rishi Sunak’s journey embodies a rare blend of high finance and high politics. Few have navigated the worlds of global banking and national leadership with such prominence. His career trajectory, from a young banker in New York to the UK’s highest political office, and now back to the financial sector, illustrates the increasingly interconnected nature of finance and governance in the 21st century. As he steps into this advisory role, Sunak brings a wealth of experience shaped by crises and leadership, poised to influence global economic discussions from a new vantage point.In a world where the lines between public service and private enterprise often blur, Sunak’s return to Goldman Sachs is a vivid example of how careers can evolve in unexpected ways, reflecting both personal ambition and a broader narrative of resilience and adaptability.","Former uk prime minister rishi sunak is returning to goldman sachs as a senior adviser.

Attorney Tony Buzbee blames mutual agreement for missing high-profile Las Vegas court appearance

Legal miscommunication or strategic legal posturing?

Public fallout and media retreat

The already controversial sexual assault lawsuit against NFL Hall of Famer and media personality Shannon Sharpe took another dramatic turn last week when the accuser’s legal team failed to appear at the initial court hearing in Las Vegas. The no-show left observers stunned and the presiding judge visibly disappointed—only for attorney Tony Buzbee to issue a statement days later that added more questions than clarity.“We are apologizing to the Court by letter for wasting the Court’s time,” Attorney Tony Buzbee told Pro Football Talk. “There was a mutual agreement among counsel to postpone the motion scheduled for July 9.
