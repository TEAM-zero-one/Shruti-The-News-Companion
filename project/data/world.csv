India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his debut on Truth Social on Monday and was quick to respond to US President Donald Trump, who had shared a link to Modi’s recent podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman.In his reply, PM Modi thanked Trump and highlighted the broad themes he covered in the podcast, including his personal journey, India’s civilisational outlook, and global issues.“Thank you, my friend, President Trump. I’ve covered a wide range of topics, including my life journey, India’s civilisational outlook, global issues, and more,” PM Modi wrote on Truth Social.Trump had earlier posted a YouTube link to PM Modi’s extensive conversation with Fridman, which lasted nearly three hours.In the podcast, the Prime Minister Modi spoke at length about his experiences with Trump, their close working relationship, and his admiration for Trump’s leadership style. He recalled key moments such as the grand ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston in 2019 and shared how Trump had personally taken him on a guided tour of the White House, detailing historical facts without notes.PM Modi also commended Trump’s resilience after the recent assassination attempt, stating that his unwavering commitment to America reminded him of his own “Nation First” principle.PM Modi’s arrival on Truth Social is significant, as the platform is primarily associated with Trump’s supporters and conservative voices in the US. His first post read, “Delighted to be on Truth Social! Looking forward to interacting with all the passionate voices here and engaging in meaningful conversations in the times to come.”Trump has often praised PM Modi, calling him a “tough and better negotiator,” a remark the Indian leader addressed in the podcast, saying that while he appreciated the compliment, his focus has always been on India’s interests in any negotiations. PM Modi also noted that Trump appeared more prepared for his second presidential term, suggesting that he had a clearer roadmap and well-defined goals.The exchange between the two leaders comes at a crucial time, as India and the US are engaged in negotiations over trade tariffs.Trump has previously criticised India’s high tariff rates, while the Indian government has assured a parliamentary panel that no firm commitments have been made yet, with discussions ongoing.","Prime minister narendra modi responds to us president donald trump on truth social.

In 7 charts: Indian-Americans concerned about India-US ties under Trump 2.0; bullish on India's trajectory under PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-7-charts-indian-americans-concerned-about-india-us-ties-under-trump-2-0-bullish-on-indias-trajectory-under-pm-modi/articleshow/118973218.cms,"On India's trajectory

BJP, PM Modi's popularity



Although Indian-Americans shifted to the right politically ahead of the 2024 US election, many remain concerned about what the future holds for US-India ties under a second Trump administration, as per the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS).Donald Trump's economic policies, particularly his protectionist stance and focus on ""reciprocal taxes"", have put India-US trade relations under strain. Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly criticised India's high import duties, which he has said are ""unfair"" to American exporters.His proposed tariffs on Indian exports could severely impact sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, which rely heavily on the US market.Additionally, his administration's stricter immigration policies, such as tightening H-1B visa requirements, could further affect India's tech workforce in the US, thus further straining ties.As per the IAAS report — conducted before the US presidential election results — many Indian-Americans are concerned about bilateral relations under the Trump administration. In fact, Indian-Americans rate the Joe Biden administration 's record on India slightly better than the first Trump administration.Thirty-four percent of respondents identified Biden as doing a better job, and 28 percent said Trump handled bilateral relations better during his first term. Roughly the same proportion, 26 percent, felt the presidents' performances were generally the same.In addition, respondents said bilateral relationship would have been more likely to prosper under a putative Kamala Harris administration compared to a second Trump administration.The survey also asked respondents which American political party does a better job managing US-India relations .A total of 41 percent of respondents said the Democratic Party while 24 percent named the Republican Party. One-quarter of all respondents perceived no difference between the two parties.As the 2024 IAAS was fielded before the US election, it also asked two questions about the prospects for US-India ties under a putative Kamala Harris or second Trump administration. A total of 53 percent of respondents said US-India ties would become stronger if Harris had been elected, 15 per cent state they would get worse, and 32 percent reported they would not change.Respondents were somewhat less bullish on prospects under a second Trump presidency. Forty percent reported ties would improve, 26 percent felt they would worsen, and 34 percent opined they would be unchanged.Compared to 2020, Indian-Americans are more bullish on India’s trajectory, said the IAAS report. Forty-seven percent of Indian-Americans believed that India is headed in the right direction, a 10 percentage point increase from four years ago.The same share approved of Modi's prime ministerial performance. Four in ten respondents said that India’s 2024 election made the country more democratic.Forty-seven percent of respondents felt India is politically on the right track, 32 percent felt it is on the wrong track, and 21 percent cannot say.These numbers represent a significant shift from the 2020 IAAS. Four years ago, respondents’ assessments were markedly more pessimistic, with 36 percent believing India was on the right track and 39 percent reporting it was on the wrong track.The survey also asked about Indian-Americans’ views of India’s current policy direction.Forty-six percent of respondents report that they are either strongly or somewhat supportive of the present government’s policies.Thirty-six percent report they are somewhat or strongly critical of the government’s policies. Eighteen percent express no opinion. These numbers are broadly in line with respondents’ “right track/wrong track” assessments.As per the report, one possible explanation for the relatively more bullish assessment of India in 2024 is that respondents were heartened by the results of the 2024 election, which resulted in a more evenly divided Parliament and greater dispersion of political power. Indeed, some observers interpreted the result of India’s 2024 general election as giving a fillip to democracy since the outcome produced a coalition government and more robust opposition in Parliament.Four in ten members of the Indian American diaspora agree with this sentiment. Forty-one percent of respondents said the 2024 election made India much or somewhat more democratic. On the other hand, 28 percent took the opposite view — that India is much or somewhat less democratic in the aftermath of the general election. Fourteen percent of all respondents did not view the 2024 election as changing India’s democratic character in either direction.The BJP remains the most popular party among Indian-Americans, with 28 percent of respondents identifying with the party.Twenty percent identified with the Congress party, and just 1 percent identified with a third party. In the 2020 IAAS, 32 percent of respondents supported the BJP, 12 percent supported the Congress, and 11 percent identified with a third party.The data suggest that the BJP remains the diaspora’s favored party, but the gap with the Congress, has narrowed compared to 2020.The survey further found that 47 percent of respondents approve of PM Modi’s job in office (36 percent strongly approve and 11 percent approve), while 34 percent disapprove (23 percent strongly disapprove and 11 percent disapprove). An additional 19 percent express no opinion either way.PM Modi’s approval ratings among the diaspora have not budged much in four years. In 2020, 50 percent approved of the job PM Modi was doing (35 percent strongly approved and 15 percent approved) and 31 percent disapproved (22 percent strongly disapproved and 9 percent disapproved).","Donald trump's economic policies, particularly his protectionist stance and focus on ""reciprocal taxes"", have put india-us trade relations under strain.

'Pragmatic approach'

NEW DELHI: China on Monday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent remarks on India-China relations , praising his emphasis on dialogue over discord .Beijing described the relationship between the two nations as a ""ballet between the dragon and the elephant"" that must continue for mutual success.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning acknowledged PM Modi ’s ""positive"" comments and highlighted the progress in bilateral ties since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia. ""China noted Prime Minister Modi's recent positive statement on China-India relations and appreciates it,"" Mao said at a media briefing. She reiterated that their meeting had provided strategic direction for both countries.Furthermore, she underlined the historical interactions between the two nations, stating, ""In the 2000-plus years of history, the two countries have maintained friendly exchanges and learned from each other, contributing to civilisational achievements and human progress."" Stressing the importance of mutual growth, she added, ""The two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success, and a 'cooperative pas de deux,' a ballet between the dragon and elephant, is the only choice for both sides.""During his nearly 3-hour conversation with podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi expressed optimism about ties between the two countries, highlighting their shared history and the importance of ensuring that ""differences do not turn into disputes."" He noted that India and China once contributed over 50% of the global GDP and stressed that cooperation between the two nations is beneficial and essential for global peace and prosperity.The Global Times , a Chinese state-run daily, also praised PM Modi’s remarks, acknowledging his push for dialogue despite past tensions. The publication featured an article quoting experts who viewed PM Modi’s statements as a ""pragmatic approach"" towards balancing cooperation and competition with China. Qian Feng, director at Tsinghua University’s National Strategy Institute, noted that since the Kazan summit , both countries have taken ""positive strides"" in implementing key agreements, improving diplomatic and military communications, and maintaining border stability .Addressing past conflicts, including the 2020 standoff in eastern Ladakh, PM Modi acknowledged in the podcast that tensions had existed but said his talks with President Xi had led to progress. ""After my meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border. We are working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020,"" he said.Earlier this month, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi also said that India and China should not allow their differences to dictate bilateral relations. ""As two ancient civilisations, we have enough wisdom and capability to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas, pending a fair and reasonable solution to the boundary issue,"" Wang said.He added that both nations should prioritise broader cooperation and avoid letting disputes define their relationship. ""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question or specific differences to affect the overall picture of our bilateral ties.

On Trump's tariff war



(With inputs from ANI)

Newly appointed US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday revealed the profound impact of the Bhagavad Gita on her life and career. Gabbard, who has been a long-time admirer of the ancient Hindu text, emphasised how Lord Krishna's teachings to Arjuna have been a source of strength and guidance for her, whether in the midst of war zones or facing the complex challenges of her current role.In an interview with ANI, Gabbard said: ""Whether serving in war zones in different parts of the world or the challenges that we face now, it is (Lord) Krishna's teachings to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that I turn to in the best of times and the worst of times.""Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has often talked about her deep connection with the Bhagavad Gita.In 2020, she urged Hindu students to explore the concepts of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga as outlined in the Gita, emphasiding the importance of service to society as a path to true success. Her daily practice includes meditation, yoga, and reading the Gita.Tulsi Gabbard, currently visiting India as part of a multi-nation trip, also emphasised the importance of direct dialogue between India and the United States on tariff issues.Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the think-tank Observer Research Foundation's annual Raisina Dialogues in Delhi, she highlighted opportunities to strengthen economic ties between the two nations.Gabbard noted that conversations with Indian officials revealed optimism about enhancing economic relations.""There is significant potential for strengthening our economic partnership. It’s encouraging to see a more positive outlook on this issue rather than focusing solely on tariffs,"" she said, acknowledging that both PM Narendra Modi and President Trump are prioritising their respective nations' economic interests but are also working towards mutually beneficial solutions.""What I have heard from the Indian government officials that I've spoken to over the last few days, there is an opportunity here to see. There is more potential for strengthening of our economic relationship and I'm glad to see that they're looking at it in a more positive light than just one that is focused in a negative way, when we look at tariffs. Obviously Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interest of India's economy and the opportunities available for the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the United States, our economic interests and the interests of the American people "" she added.Gabbar also praised the leadership of PM Modi and Trump, describing them as pragmatic leaders seeking effective solutions. Gabbard pointed out that high-level dialogues, along with discussions among cabinet members and secretaries, are crucial for charting a forward path. She also expressed excitement about the private sector's keen interest in fostering bilateral economic engagement.""What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders who have common sense and who are looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is happening at the very top in both of our countries, but also at the different secretaries and the cabinet members is going to be key to lay down what that path forward really looks like. And I personally am excited because there's keen interest in the private sector here in India and in the United States,"" she said.Additionally, Gabbard highlighted the strong personal rapport between PM Modi and Trump as a solid foundation for deepening the US-India partnership. She referred to PM Modi's earlier visit to the White House as instrumental in setting a collaborative tone for future engagements.Reflecting on her meetings with Indian officials, Gabbard underscored the broad scope of cooperation, spanning intelligence, commerce, trade, defense, and education. She concluded by expressing optimism about the immense opportunities available for advancing the US-India relationship across multiple domains.""The tone and the relationship with our new administration under President Trump and Prime Minister Modi was set during Prime Minister Modi's visit to the White House. As you know, they are already good friends.

NEW DELHI: Visiting director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the US was concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump admin was committed to defeating ""Islamist terrorism "" globally.

""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.The two stressed that strategic security remained a vital pillar of the comprehensive global strategic cooperation between India and the US.

Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements. The successful meeting between President Xi and PM Modi in Kazan last Oct provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties.

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","Us immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

In addition to joint exercises, training and port visits, a roadmap for bilateral defence industry collaboration will be developed, he said.With an eye on China, the PM also said in his media statement after the meeting that India believed in the policy of development and not expansionism. Presence of Khalistani separatists in the Five Eyes, English-speaking countries that share an intelligence alliance, and their efforts to hurt Indian interests remain a major concern for India. After raising that issue, Modi took Luxon to Rakabganj Gurdwara for a tour of the Sikh shrine.PM Modi said both sides would continue to cooperate in combating terrorist, separatist and extremist elements. He said India had shared its concerns about anti-India activities by certain illegal elements in New Zealand. ""We're confident that we will continue to receive full cooperation of New Zealand govt against such illegal elements,"" he said. ""We stand united against terrorism. Whether it is Christchurch terrorist attack of March 15, 2019, or Mumbai attack of Nov 26, 2008, terrorism in any form is unacceptable. Strict action must be taken against those responsible for such attacks,"" he said.On FTA, Modi said it would increase the potential for bilateral trade and investment. ""Mutual cooperation and investment shall be encouraged in fields such as dairy, food processing and pharma. We have given priority to mutual cooperation in the areas of renewable energy and critical minerals,"" the PM said. ""Indian community living in New Zealand is making a valuable contribution to the country's social and economic development. We have agreed to work swiftly on an agreement to simplify the mobility of skilled workers and address issues related to illegal migration,"" he added.In a joint statement, the two leaders reaffirmed right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as also the need to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes. New Zealand joined India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative. Luxon strongly reiterated New Zealand's support for a permanent seat for India in a reformed UN Security Council both in the meeting with Modi, and also while speaking as the guest of honour at the Raisina Dialogue.Both endorsed increasing defence engagements, including through participation in military exercises, staff college exchanges, regular port calls by naval ships, and exchange of high-level defence delegations. They referred to upcoming port call in Mumbai by Royal New Zealand Navy Ship HMNZS Te Kaha. Modi and Luxon backed territorial integrity and sovereignty in the Indo-Pacific, and also expressed support for a just and lasting peace based on respect for international law in Ukraine war. They also backed a two-state solution for Gaza.The two reiterated their ""absolute condemnation"" of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and the use of terrorist proxies in cross-border terrorism.

He was responding to a question about US President Donald Trump's allegation that USAID spent $21 million to boost voter turnout in India's elections.Govt had earlier said that Indian agencies were probing the issue.""While there is some open-source information available on this matter, govt understandably expects an official response from the US govt on this matter,"" he said.Publicly available information about beneficiary individuals/organisations has also been redacted in certain cases apparently in line with the exceptions outlined in US Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016.As per that legislation, exceptional redactions include information that would jeopardise health or security of an implementing partner or programme beneficiary. Another justification is a determination that the information online would be detrimental to the national interests of US, added the minister.On steps being taken to prevent Trump's remarks on tariffs from affecting India-US ties, the minister said both sides remain engaged to address all issues of concern including the issue of trade and tariffs in a constructive manner.Singh said Modi's visit to Washington DC on Feb 13 offered an opportunity for both the leaders to reaffirm the strength of India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership that is anchored in mutual trust, shared interests, goodwill and robust engagement of their citizens.",India has formally asked us embassy to urgently furnish details of expenditure incurred on all usaid-assisted or funded projects in india over the past 10 years.

NEW DELHI: The ISI has come under fire after firebrand cleric Mufti Munir Shakir , a known critic of the Pak state was killed in an IED attack in Peshawar two days ago. At his funeral, Mufti's son directly blamed Pakistani intelligence for his death and thousands chanted slogans against the military and the Pak army, accusing them of targeting Pashtuns .A video of the funeral surfaced on X on Monday showing the funeral ground echoing with slogans like ""Yeh Col, General...dehshatgard...Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai iske piche vardi hai...

UK royal Prince Harry once again is facing deportation possibility as a US court has ruled that Prince Harry's immigration files be disclosed by Tuesday.Judge Carl Nichols has directed the release of documents pertaining to the Duke of Sussex's US visa application, following a Freedom of Information (FOI)request. The conservative Heritage Foundation, a US think-tank, initiated the FOI request, suggesting the duke potentially omitted previous drug use which could have affected his visa eligibility. Court documents dated 15 March show Judge Nichols instructed the US Department of Homeland Security to provide a redacted version by Tuesday, as reported by Sky News.Despite the same judge ruling in September last year that public interest in Harry's immigration records was not substantial, the judge has now revised his position.The Heritage Foundation sought this reversal, questioning Harry's 2020 US entry following his admissions about cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book Spare. In his autobiography, Harry revealed: ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", and added: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""The foundation argued that his visa application responses regarding past drug use could raise concerns about governmental procedures. The Department of Homeland Security's lawyers agreed in February to release censored versions, despite previously denying the FOI request. Department lawyer John Bardo stated in court documents that they would remove information deemed withholdable by the Court.Even US President Donald Trump had addressed these concerns surrounding the UK prince and stated to The New York Post in February that he wouldn't deport Harry, saying: ""I'll leave him alone."" He further took a jab at his wife saying, ""He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""

Trump trolls Biden's alleged autopen use

In a scathing attack on former President Joe Biden , US President Donald Trump declared that presidential pardons issued by are ""VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT""—alleging they were signed using an autopen without his predecessor's knowledge or direct approval.Trump's statement, posted to his Truth Social account, specifically targeted members of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th Capitol riot , whom he dubbed the ""Unselect Committee of Political Thugs."" Trump claimed that any pardons associated with the committee are illegitimate due to their alleged use of the autopen, a device that reproduces a person's signature. ""The “Pardons” that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!"" said Trump.""The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime,"" Trump wrote. He further alleged that members of the January 6th committee ""destroyed and deleted ALL evidence"" from their investigation and suggested they could face legal scrutiny while continuing his jab at Biden. ""Those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden!"" added Trump to his statement.Before the social media statement, Trump shared an image featuring three images: his official presidential portrait from his first term, a picture of Biden's autopen, and a portrait representing a second Trump term. He pinned the post to his account, amplifying the message to his followers.""The person who was the real President during the Biden years was the person who controlled the Autopen!"" Trump quipped in another post.The use of the autopen by US presidents is not new.
