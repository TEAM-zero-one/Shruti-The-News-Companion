NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday filed an FIR against BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for allegedly spreading false information, police said.The case, registered at High Grounds police station, was based on a complaint by Shrikant Swaroop B N, head of the Indian Youth Congress's legal cell.The two have been booked under Sections 192 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) and 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Swaroop accused Malviya and Goswami of ""masterminding a heinous and criminally motivated campaign to disseminate patently false information.""He said they ""maliciously propagated the fabricated claim"" that the Istanbul Congress Centre in Turkey is the office of the Indian National Congress.Earlier on Tuesday, Malviya posted an image comparing Rahul Gandhi to Pakistan's military leadership, accusing him of undermining India’s military and echoing Pakistan’s stance on Operation Sindoor.""This act was executed with clear and undeniable criminal intent to deceive the Indian public, defame a major political institution, manipulate nationalist sentiments, incite public unrest, and undermine national security and democratic integrity,"" Swaroop said.He also pointed out that the incident comes amid strained India-Turkey ties, worsened by Turkey’s perceived support for Pakistan.""The actions of Malviya and Goswami represent an unprecedented attack on India's democratic foundations, public safety, and national security. Their calculated misuse of influence to spread falsehoods with criminal intent demands the harshest response,"" the complaint alleged.Swaroop urged the Press Council of India, ministry of information and broadcasting, CBI, and other agencies to treat the complaint as an emergency.","The congress on tuesday filed an fir against bjp it cell chief amit malviya and republic tv editor-in-chief arnab goswami.

""If you remain in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay, you could be deported and could face a permanent ban on traveling to the United States in the future,"" the post read.This is applicable to Indians who are traveling to the US on their various time-bound visas like work visas, student visas, tourist visas etc which have their own authorized period of stay.Immigration is the most contentious issue of the Donald Trump administration with the president making his intent clear on the very first day in the office in his first executive order.

Indian Army’s Ferocious PoK Action; ‘All Pakistani Military Positions Smashed In Leepa Valley’

NEW DELHI: A district court on Tuesday sent Ashoka University professor Ali Khan Mahmoodabad to judicial custody over his post on Operation Sindoor. The next date of hearing in the case is May 27.Mahmudabad was arrested on Sunday after two FIRs were filed against him. He had been granted two-day police custody based on a complaint by the Haryana state commission for women.In the post, he said: ""Strategically, India has actually begun a new phase in terms of collapsing distinction between military and terrorist (non-state actors) in Pakistan. In effect, the response to any terrorist activity will invite a conventional response and so this puts the onus on the Pakistani military to make sure that it cannot hide any longer behind terrorists and non-state actors. In any case, the Pak military has used militarised non-state actors to destabilise the region for far too long while also claiming to be victims on the international stage. It has also used the same actors - some of whom were targeted in the recent strikes - to foment sectarian tension in Pakistan. Operation Sindoor resets all received notions of Indo-Pak relationships as the response to terrorist attacks will be met with a military response and removes any semantic distinction between the two.Despite this collapse, care has been taken by the Indian armed forces to not target military or civilian installations...""He clarified that his remarks were misinterpreted. He explained that his intention was to criticize war-mongering narratives and draw attention to civilian suffering during conflicts, while stressing the importance of safeguarding all Indian citizens, including minorities. He also expressed support for the Indian military’s restrained approach and condemned Pakistan’s use of terrorism.The arrest came after the Haryana women’s commission issued a notice over Mahmudabad’s social media posts, despite his clarification that his remarks were misinterpreted and were within his fundamental rights. His posts had raised concerns over the treatment of lynching victims and commented on media coverage involving Col Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh.His arrest drew strong criticism from students, colleagues, and political leaders.

NEW DELHI: The Chinar Corps of the Indian Army has fully destroyed military infrastructure in Leepa Valley , located in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK), news agency PTI reported, quoting officials. Indian Army officers believe it will take Pakistan between 8 to 12 months to rebuild the damaged sites.According to the PTI report, the destruction took place during Operation Sindoor ""We completely destroyed at least three posts, an ammunition depot, fuel storage facility, and gunnery, among other targets. Our retaliation was so devastating that it will take Pakistan at least 8-12 months to rebuild, possibly longer,"" a senior Indian Army official was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.Another official said that the Pakistan Army used heavy weapons, including aerial platforms, to hit Indian positions, but was not able to cause any damage.""Our indigenously developed Akashdeep radar system performed brilliantly while our air defence guns neutralised their aerial platforms. Our military infrastructure remains intact, while the enemy's has been decimated,"" the second official was quoted by the PTI.Officials said that although there were several empty military buildings in Leepa Valley, the Indian Army chose to hit locations where the most damage could be done.Based on information gathered from different sources, Indian Army officers said that 64 Pakistani military personnel were killed and 96 were injured during the Indian strikes led by the Chinar Corps in the second week of May.""The message was clear – our retaliation follows a 1:3 ratio, meaning the Indian Army will strike three times as hard for every Pakistani ceasefire violation,"" a top Chinar Corps official was quoted as saying by the PTI.Giving more information about a 25-minute operation near Muzaffarabad in PoK on May 7, part of Operation Sindoor and in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, officials said the strikes were so strong that the commander of PoK's 75th Infantry Brigade told troops to focus on saving lives.""Intercepted communication revealed how a Pakistan Army commander, hiding inside a mosque, was instructing troops to save lives first. One message was 'save lives first, offices can reopen later',"" a senior Chinar Corps official said.On May 7, under Operation Sindoor, India also destroyed nine terror camps in Pakistan and PoK.This was in response to a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir ’s Pahalgam last month, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. Following India’s strike, Pakistan retaliated with shelling across the Line of Control and Jammu and Kashmir, along with attempted drone attacks along the border.After Pakistan's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. Both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on May 10.","The chinar corps of the indian army has fully destroyed military infrastructure in leepa valley, located in pakistan-occupied kashmir.

'Jaishankar's Silence Is Damning': Rahul Gandhi Again Questions EAM On Op Sindoor, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) launched a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday, and accused him of undermining nation's military operation and echoing Pakistan 's narrative in his recent comments about Operation Sindoor BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya posted an image comparing Gandhi with Pakistan's military leadership.""It is not surprising that Rahul Gandhi is speaking the language of Pakistan and its benefactors. He hasn’t congratulated the Prime Minister on the flawless Operation Sindoor, which unmistakably showcases India’s dominance. Instead, he repeatedly asks how many jets we lost—a question that has already been addressed in the DGMO briefings,"" Malviya said in a post on X.""Curiously, he hasn’t once inquired about how many Pakistani jets were shot down during the conflict, or how many were destroyed while parked in their hangars when Indian forces pounded Pakistani airbases. What’s next for Rahul Gandhi? The Nishan-e-Pakistan?” he added.The controversy intensified after Rahul Gandhi questioned external affairs minister S. Jaishankar 's remarks on Operation Sindoor, which was conducted in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Rahul Gandhi suggested that advance warning to Pakistan might have compromised the operation's effectiveness, calling it ""not just a lapse, but a crime.""“EAM Jaishankar’s silence isn’t just telling — it’s damning. So I’ll ask again: How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew?” Gandhi posted on Monday, reiterating allegations that the government’s forewarning allowed Pakistan to prepare. ""This wasn’t a lapse. It was a crime. And the nation deserves the truth,"" he added.Congress leader Pawan Khera countered Malviya's criticism by referencing historical instances of BJP leaders' interactions with Pakistan, including mentions of former Prime Minister Morarji Desai's Nishan-e-Pakistan award and other diplomatic engagements.""We want to ask the political leadership of this country that you informed Pakistan beforehand, is this the reason why Azhar Masood and Hafiz Saeed could escape?...As far as Nishaan-e-Pakistan is concerned, their leader, Morarji Desai, was the only Indian politician who was awarded it,"" Congress leader Pawan Khera said.""Some more people deserve Nishan-e-Pakistan, like Lal Krishna Advani and the person who went to eat biryani with Nawaz Sharif without being invited. We think he will get Nisha-e-Pakistan. There is another person who deserves Nisha-e-Pakistan- the one who said 'at the start of the action'. These are the words of EAM Dr S Jaishankar, who informed Pakistan that we are taking action only on terrorist hideouts. He has very close relations with America. So now let's see what award he gets from which country,"" he added.Meanwhile, the ministry of external affairs had firmly rejected Gandhi's allegations about prior notification to Pakistan. The MEA clarified that communication with Pakistan occurred only after Operation Sindoor was underway, dismissing claims of advance warning as ""misrepresentation of facts.""",'jaishankar's silence is damning': rahul gandhi again questions eam on op sindoor.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday aggressively retaliated to Rahul Gandhi's continuing charge that foreign minister S Jaishankar had ""forewarned"" Pakistan about strikes on terror targets under Operation Sindoor , saying the Congress MP was ""a new age Mir Jafar"".The marked escalation in BJP's attack on the issue led Congress to call Jaishankar a ""Jaichand"" - the medieval period ruler of Kannauj who is depicted as a ""traitor"" after he allied with Muhammad Ghori against Prithviraj Chauhan.Rahul is ""a new age Mir Jafar"", BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said on X while sharing an image juxtaposing Rahul's photo with that of Pakistan army chief Asim Munir and captioning it, ""What's next for Rahul Gandhi?

He said that Rahul never asked about Pakistani jets downed or destroyed in the operation but instead focused on Indian losses, a question already addressed in DGMO briefings.Malviya shared another cartoon on X depicting Rahul Gandhi, backed by Pakistan, questioning IAF jet losses.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of the just-settled controversy triggered by Congress' objections to govt picking its members for global outreach on Pakistan-sponsored terror , senior MP Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday called for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism - a line also echoed by Congress MP Manish Tewari Tharoor, who announced he would be heading a multi-party delegation despite Congress not recommending his name, has sought pan-political consensus on terror, in what could be seen as a message to his party. The post-Pahalgam row has intensified with Congress seizing upon the video comment of foreign minister S Jaishankar to accuse him of informing Pakistan in advance about the military action.In a media article, Tharoor started with a lament over political parties ""weaponising grief for electoral advantage rather than forging a unified front"" and mentioned how India's swift retaliation over the Pulwama attack in 2019 became part of the election campaign narrative - a swipe at the governing BJP. But his call for political consensus in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and the row over delegations can be seen as an appeal to Congress to eschew political and procedural issues for larger national goal.Like Tharoor, Tewari too had signalled that he would do ""national duty"" by being part of the delegation, irrespective of what Congress decided. On Sunday, as the dust settled with Congress announcing that all its members would be part of the delegation despite being picked by govt, Tewari posted on X a Hindi movie song ""Dekho veer jawaanon apne khoon pe yeh ilzaam na aaye, Maa na kahe ke mere bete waqt pada to kaam na aaye"" - implying the sense of not being found wanting in national duty.The issue of delegations, where govt picked all four members from Congress despite the parliamentary affairs minister asking Congress to submit its choices, has created bitterness.","Senior mp shashi tharoor calls for bi-partisanship on matters of security like terrorism.
