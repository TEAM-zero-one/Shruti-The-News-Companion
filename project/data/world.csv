: Rubio

NEW DELHI:“Indians deserved it,” an exultant Tahawwur Rana told fellow jihadi David Coleman Headley aka Daood Gilani, his words dripping with venom, as he spoke about the 26/11 carnage. Unsurprisingly, the remark celebrating the massacre of 166 innocent civilians found mention in the US justice department’s statement explaining his extradition to India.Justice department also released photographs of Rana being handed over by US Marshals to NIA in Los Angeles. The photos show Rana in prison browns, shackled with chains around his waist and legs.“In an intercepted conversation with Headley, Rana allegedly commended the nine LeT terrorists who were killed committing the attacks, saying they should be given Nishan-e-Haider — Pakistan’s highest award for gallantry in battle, which is reserved for fallen soldiers,” the statement further said, something which served to underline yet again the nexus between Lashkar-e-Tai ba terrorists who traumatised Mumbai and Pakistan’s military-intelligence complex.It was perhaps due to Rana being such a high value asset for Pakistan that the aircraft transporting him from the US steered clear of Pakistani airspace. Sources said the plane flew over Iran to come to India.Even in NIA’s custody, Rana hasn’t shown an iota of remorse, a source said. “He has been calm and composed, without any tantrums,” he added.The prosecution by India is not a first for Rana who has been accused of conspiring to commit violent acts of terrorism. In 2013, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison following his conviction in the Northern District of Illinois, US, for conspiring to provide material support to LeT and to a foiled LeT-sponsored terrorist plot in Copenhagen, Denmark.“As part of those same criminal proceedings, Headley had pleaded guilty to 12 federal terrorism charges , including aiding and abetting the murders of six Americans in Mumbai and later planning to attack a Danish newspaper, and was sentenced to 35 years in prison,"" the US justice department statement said.The US extradited Tahawwur Rana to India to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack , secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Friday. “Together, with India, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six Americans, who lost their lives in these attacks. I'm glad that day has come,” he said on X.His counterpart S Jaishankar responded, appreciating the counter-terrorism cooperation between the countries. “This is indeed a big step in ensuring justice for victims of 26/11 attacks ,” he said.The state department said, “The US has long supported India’s efforts to ensure those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice. As President Trump has said, the US and India will continue to work together to combat the global scourge of terrorism.” TNN","The us extradited tahawwur rana to india to face charges for his role in planning the 2008 mumbai terrorist attack. “together, with india, we’ve long sought justice for the 166 people, including six americans, who lost their lives in these attacks.

"Tahawwur Rana arrested on arrival in India, appears before NIA court, sent to 18-day custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tahawwur-rana-arrested-on-arrival-in-india-appears-before-nia-court-sent-to-18-day-custody/articleshow/120177280.cms,"NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , who played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives, was arrested by NIA here on Thursday after his arrival from US on a special flight.The Pakistani-Canadian terrorist was produced before special NIA judge Chander Jit Singh, who held an in-camera hearing on NIA counsel and special public prosecutor Narender Mann's plea for a 20-day remand. Rana was represented by Piyush Sachdeva, provided to him by Delhi Legal Services Authority. After the hearing, the court sent Rana to 18-day NIA custody.Rana's extradition process was nothing short of a nail-biter with fears of sabotage looming till the flight touched down at Palam airport's technical area. The home ministry and the office of NSA, along with Intelligence Bureau, constantly monitored the flight ferrying Rana, taking precautions to thwart any attempt to stop him from landing in the grasp of Indian agencies.Exercising utmost caution in extraditing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a dummy code was generated for the chartered aircraft, a Gulfstream G550, ferrying him to India to avoid detection on public flight trackers and alleviate threats of an attack. The aircraft took off from Los Angeles in the early hours of Wednesday and landed in New Delhi around 6 pm, after a pit stop in Romania.Rana, along with his close school friend and fellow jihadi Daood Gilani aka David Coleman Headley, had left Mumbai on Nov 19, 2008, just a week before a gang of jihadi terrorists belonging to and motivated by LeT and trained by serving officers of Pakistan army landed on the Worli shore to carry out an attack in which 166 people were killed and which left the nation traumatised. The massacre marked the execution of a plan that Rana and Headley helped draw by selecting the targets to be struck.As Rana stepped on the tarmac in prison browns with NIA personnel clinging to him, he looked far from the unassuming businessman he had posed as when he checked into a Powai hotel in Mumbai in 2008. He had also visited Agra, Hapur, Kochi and other cities during this trip, supposedly to promote his immigration business, though NIA suspects the trips may have been a cover to scout for potential terror recruits for LeT.Rana, for long a strategic asset for Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan's military intelligence complex, was placed under arrest at the airport, made to undergo a medical examination and whisked to court through a green corridor amid heavy security comprising a 20-vehicle cavalcade and SWAT commandos.On the plane back to India, Rana was seated in the middle with NSG commandos on all seats surrounding him, followed by senior NIA officials. Just after touchdown, the NIA acknowledged the assistance of US Sky Marshals who are assigned with secure transportation of federal prisoners, including inmate transfers via air.In a statement, the NIA termed Rana a key conspirator and confirmed his extradition. ""Rana was being held in judicial custody in the US pursuant to proceedings initiated under the India-US extradition treaty. The extradition finally came through after Rana exhausted all legal avenues to stay the move. The district court for the Central District of California had ordered his extradition on May 16, 2023. Rana then filed multiple litigations in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which were rejected,"" it said.Extradition proceedings were initiated between the two countries after India eventually secured a surrender warrant for the wanted terrorist from the US govt.The extradition finally came through after Rana's various litigations and appeals, including an emergency application before the US Supreme Court, were rejected with the active assistance of the US department of justice's Office of International Affairs, US Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, US Marshals Service, FBI's Legal Attache Office in New Delhi, and US department of state's Office of the Legal Adviser for Law Enforcement, the NIA said.For NIA investigators, the challenge will be to get Rana to reveal more than what he has already told US authorities. His interrogation will be aimed at getting to the bottom of the Mumbai attack conspiracy and exposing the role of Pakistan-based LeT masterminds like Hafiz Saeed, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and others in planning and remote-controlling one of the deadliest terror strikes against India.",Tahawwur hussain rana played a key role in plotting the 2008 terror attack on mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that India would ""never negotiate at gunpoint"" after US President Donald Trump hit a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition on countries including India.""Trade talks proceed when both sides are sensitive to each other's concerns and requirements. All our trade talks are progressing well, in the spirit of India First, and to ensure our pathway to Viksit Bharat @ 2047 in the Amrit Kaal,"" Goyal said speaking on the sidelines of the Italy-India business, science and technology forum.""We never negotiate at gunpoint. Favourable time constraints motivate us for quicker talks, but till the time we are not able to secure the interest of our country and our people, we do not hurry,"" he added.Donald Trump had, on Wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on India, except China.""Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers , Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump had declared.""Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,"" he said, exempting China from the pause period.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar remarked that India's trade negotiations were quite complex, noting that the United States had high expectations and the global environment has changed significantly compared to a year ago.""This time around, we are certainly geared up for a very high degree of urgency. I mean, we see a window. We want to see stuff. So our trade deals are really challenging. And we are really, when I look at the trade deals, I mean it's not my direct credit, but we have a lot to do with each other. I mean, these are people very much on top of their game, very ambitious about what they want to achieve,"" he said.""We talked for four years during the first Trump administration. They have their view of us, and frankly, we have our view of them. The bottom line is that they didn't get that. So if you look at the EU, often people say we've been negotiating for 30 years, which is not entirely true because we had big blocks of time and nobody was even talking to each other. But they have tended to be very protracted processes,"" he added.India is taking a measured approach to the matter, with the government actively pursuing the US-India trade agreement that was announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States earlier this year. While the 26% tariff imposed on India is higher than what many experts expected, it remains lower than the rates imposed on other countries. For instance, China initially faced a combined tariff of 54% (20% plus a 34% discount), which has now been raised to 125% following its retaliatory actions.","Commerce minister piyush goyal said that india would ""never negotiate at gunpoint"" donald trump had, on wednesday, announced a 90-day pause period on tariff imposition including 26% on india, except china.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Hussain Rana , the 64-year-old Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, arrived in India on Thursday following his extradition from the United States. He faces trial for his alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that claimed 166 lives. Rana, a former Pakistan Army medical corps officer turned immigration consultant, is accused of facilitating the attacks by providing logistical support to his childhood friend and co-conspirator, David Coleman Headley.According to a statement released by the US Department of Justice, Rana allegedly told Headley after the attacks that the Indians ""deserved it"" and praised the nine Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists who died during the assault, suggesting they should be awarded Pakistan's highest military honour, the Nishan-e-Haider. These statements were reportedly captured during intercepted conversations between the two.""After the attacks were complete, Rana allegedly told Headley that the ""Indians deserved it.” In an intercepted conversation with Headley, Rana allegedly commended the nine LeT terrorists who had been killed committing the attacks, saying that “[t]hey should be given Nishan-e-Haider”—Pakistan’s “highest award for gallantry in battle,” which is reserved for fallen soldiers,"" the statement read.Rana's extradition follows a lengthy legal battle in the United States, where he had been held in custody since 2020. After exhausting all legal avenues, including appeals to the US Supreme Court, his extradition was finalised. He arrived in Delhi on Thursday evening aboard a special flight from Los Angeles, escorted by officials from India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the US Marshals Service. Upon arrival, he was formally arrested and presented before a special NIA court, which granted the agency 18 days of custody for interrogation.Rana is accused of conspiring with Headley and operatives of designated terrorist organisations Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami (HUJI), along with other Pakistan-based co-conspirators, to carry out the devastating terror attacks in Mumbai in 2008. A total of 166 persons were killed and over 238 injured in the deadly attacks. Both LeT and HUJI have been declared as terrorist organisations by the Government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.The extradition has been hailed by Indian authorities as a significant diplomatic achievement. Home Minister Amit Shah described it as a ""major step"" in bringing the perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks to justice. Former Israeli Ambassador to India, Mark Sofer, praised the Indian government's efforts, stating he had ""nothing but praise"" for the successful extradition.Rana's extradition is expected to provide Indian investigators with crucial insights into the planning and execution of the Mumbai attacks, as well as the involvement of Pakistan-based terrorist organisations. The NIA has indicated that Rana's interrogation will focus on uncovering the full extent of the conspiracy and identifying any additional individuals involved.","Tahawwur hussain rana, 64, arrived in india on thursday following his extradition from the united states.

A US court certified it in May 2023, and Rana’s petitions were rejected by the Ninth Circuit and the US Supreme Court — his final plea being dismissed on April 4, 2025. On April 9, the US Marshals Service “executed the Secretary’s surrender warrant by surrendering Rana to Indian authorities for transportation to India,” the press release stated.Rana, 64, is charged with multiple offences in India, including conspiracy, murder, and commission of terrorist acts. He is accused of helping his childhood friend and Lashkar-e-Taiba operative David Headley scout locations in Mumbai by facilitating his travel and setting up a business cover in the city. “On two separate occasions, Rana allegedly helped Headley prepare and submit visa applications to Indian authorities that contained information Rana knew to be false,” the US said.After the attacks, Rana allegedly told Headley that the victims “deserved it,” and praised the slain terrorists saying they “should be given Nishan-e-Haider.”The 2008 attacks, carried out by 10 LeT terrorists, targeted key locations in Mumbai including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, CST station, restaurants, and a Jewish centre. Six Americans were among the 166 killed, and the attacks caused damage worth more than $1.5 billion.","Tahawwur hussain rana, 64, is charged with multiple offences in india, including conspiracy, murder, and commission of terrorist acts.

Just as the sun scorches the boneless creature,

So does virtue burn those without love.

Recently, I visited an old teacher of mine who had been hospitalised. Her children had made the heart-wrenching decision to admit her to a palliative care centre. With quiet resignation, he told me, “She has become immobile—her bones are too weak. Caring for her has become difficult.”As I looked at her, my eyes welled up. I could still hear the echo of her footsteps as she did the rounds in the corridors of our school—that struck fear and respect in equal measure.To now see her curled up in a bed, frail and still, was painful.My mind wandered back to her voice as she brought Julius Ceaser’s fall to life for us—“ O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I, and you, and all of us fell down.”Those words, once recited with such power, now felt prophetic.As people live longer, we seem to be shifting our gaze fromto. The question is no longer, but. At the heart of this lies the quiet strength of bones and muscles.Medical professionals and evolutionary scientists alike regard bones—particularly the spine—with reverence. The moment the human species stood upright, something shifted in the great story of evolution. The feat freed our hands for creating tools and crafting civilizations.Our skeleton does far more than give us shape—it shields, supports, and enables. And unlike what many think, bones are not static. They are in a constant dance of regeneration—replacing themselves every decade, keeping us upright, quite literally, in body and spirit.I find it deeply poetic is that Thiruvalluvar, the sage of profound brevity, refers to bones in the chapter on(love). And it wasn’t poetic convenience of rhyming(love) and(bone).Valluvar , the master craftsman of thought, equated bones to the soul's scaffold, just as love gives shape and meaning to human existence.“The unloving belong only to themselves. But the loving belongs to others—to their very bones.”Commentators often draw on the tale of Rishi Dadhichi, who gave up his bones to forge the divine weaponthat defeated evil. The very design of India’s Param Vir Chakra—our highest military honour—bears the mark of this ultimate sacrifice.In another verse, Valluvar says:“The throb of life is love. Without it, humans are but skeletons draped in skin.”And my favourite couplet,Here, he paints a haunting image: a boneless creature, like a worm, writhing under the harsh sun—symbolic of those without love being consumed by the very ethics they fail to uphold. In his verse, ethics is not a code—it is the omnipotent God that can destruct, and love is the only shelter.As I sat beside my teacher, soon to be left in the care of strangers, I couldn’t help but wonder—are we slowly becoming a spineless society? One that cannot bear the weight of its own elders? Have we let love become so brittle that it fractures under the demands of convenience?Perhaps that’s the reason Valluvar tried to connect bones and bonds – not once but thrice, in his chapter on love.","Bharathi bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text ‘thirukkural’ written by tamil poet and philosopher thiruvalluvar, the kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

How did the helicopter crash?



The pilot of the private helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday was identified as 36-year0old Sean Johnson, who was a Navy SEAL veteran and a former celebrity bodyguard. The pilot died along with the five members of the family of Agustin Escober, an executive of Siemens who came to New York from Barcelona to celebrate one of his children's birthday.Johnson, who recently moved to New York City to continue his aviation career, was operating a Bell 206 on Thursday as part of a sightseeing tour for a family of five from Barcelona.

Podcast survey stirs up controversy with Taylor Swift references

Brandon Graham on Retirement, Rookie Jason Stories, Art of Trash Talking & The Brady Sack | EP 133

Fan backlash highlights tensions between fame and privacy



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has found himself at the center of controversy—not for something he said, but for what fans think he and his podcast team might be implying. A listener questionnaire tied to his hit show New Heights, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor Swift ’s fanbase, who believe the show is veering too far into her territory.The Kelce brothers' New Heights podcast has enjoyed sky rocketing popularity over the past year. While much of that success is thanks to their NFL credentials and brotherly banter, the show has also benefited from Travis’s high-profile relationship with global pop icon Taylor Swift. But a recent listener survey—distributed by podcast network Wondery—has made some fans feel uncomfortable with how that relationship is being used.The survey featured response options directly referencing Swift, such as: ""I was drawn to the prospect of hearing details and clues about Taylor Swift's life and her relationship with Travis,"" and ""I like feeling like a part of the community that supports Taylor's happiness outside of her music."" These choices struck a nerve with many Swifties, who accused the podcast of using her name for marketing gain.Swift’s fans didn’t hold back online. Some labeled the survey “gross,” “pathetic,” and “embarrassing.” One user asked pointedly, “Why did you let Wondery ask about Taylor in relation to your podcast?” The criticism quickly snowballed, with others accusing Kelce and his team of “clout-chasing” and relying too heavily on Swift-related content to boost the show’s visibility.Though Travis Kelce has previously spoken respectfully about Swift and organically shared moments from their relationship on the podcast, this overt data-gathering move appeared to cross an unspoken boundary.Neither Kelce nor Wondery has commented publicly on the backlash, but the uproar highlights a tricky balancing act: navigating fame while maintaining personal boundaries. With Taylor Swift’s fan base being one of the most passionate and protective in the world, even small missteps can trigger major reactions.Also Read: “Nonsense”: Travis Kelce shuts down breakup and false community service rumors in latest podcast appearance As New Heights continues to grow, this incident serves as a reminder that not every aspect of a public relationship needs to be leveraged for clicks—even if fans are already listening.",Kansas city chiefs tight end travis kelce has found himself at the center of controversy.

Amid the continuing grounding of 330 ‘Dhruv’ advanced light helicopters (ALHs) after a crash three months ago, which has hit operations in the armed forces, Hindustan Aeronautics on Friday publicly lashed out at some serving military officers, former pilots, “so-called defence analysts” and “armchair critics” for spreading “malicious” and “speculative” narratives on the indigenous 5.5-tonne chopper.“These stories are written without offering HAL’s perspective, and arguments are one-sided and biased. HAL would like to reiterate it’s working with all its customers including IAF and is confident of handling the critical issues that are innate to the defence aeronautics and com plex flying platforms,” the defence PSU said.Critics were quick to respond and demand complete transparency on flight safety issues. “The interests of your (HAL) stakeholders are best served if you welcome criticism, work with greater transparency, stop shooting messengers and hallucinating about malafide intent. Your worst critic is not your enemy; just as a sycophant is not your best friend. Learn to differentiate,” former naval aviator and test pilot Commander K P Sanjeev Kumar (retd)said.HAL has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters as well as the grounding of all the twin-engine ALHs, designed and produced by the PSU, since the crash in Porbandar on Jan 5.","Hal has been facing tremendous flak in recent months due to the huge delays in production of indigenous tejas mark-1a fighters.

White House explains why Donald Trump's tariffs were 'necessary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-explains-why-donald-trumps-tariffs-were-necessary/articleshow/120222161.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The White House strongly defended former President Donald Trump’s tariffs, saying that they were a long-overdue response to decades of economic policies that devastated American workers and hollowed out the country’s industrial base.In a detailed statement, the administration compared previous trade policies to “insanity,” suggesting it was irrational to continue down a path that had already led to soaring trade deficits and widespread job losses. “The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,” the statement read, recalling a 2005 New York Times editorial that warned of “dangerous deficits” when the monthly US trade deficit hit $58.3 billion.""It’s cliché, yet true — the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and expecting a different result. The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,"" the statement read.Citing the remarks of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the statement said these persistent deficits helped trigger the Great Recession and have continued to erode America’s economic self-sufficiency. Since 1990, manufacturing jobs in New York have dropped by 59%, and by 35% in Ohio. “The loss of these jobs killed innocent Americans and destroyed towns,” the statement claimed, adding that job losses from bad trade deals have been linked to rising drug overdoses.Critics of Trump’s tariffs, particularly among liberal commentators, were called out in the White House statement for dismissing efforts to reshore American industry. CNN’s Nia Malika-Henderson was singled out for asking whether it was “worth it to upend the global economy for HVAC jobs,” to which the White House responded pointedly, “Apparently, Nia Malika-Henderson thinks preserving low-wage jobs in China is more important than creating high-wage jobs in America.”The statement listed a wave of recent investments from both US and international firms in American manufacturing as proof that Trump’s trade approach is yielding results. Companies including Nvidia, Apple, Novartis, TSMC, Hyundai, and Eli Lilly have all committed billions to new or expanded US-based facilities. These investments, the White House s, vaidalidate Trump’s strategy to restore domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains—a matter described as a “national security emergency.”Yet, Trump’s tariff strategy has not come without disruption. His sudden imposition—and equally abrupt suspension—of new global tariffs in April shocked financial markets and unsettled businesses. Since President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement last week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has fallen 5.2%. While Trump insisted the 90-day pause was part of a broader negotiation strategy, many saw it as a reaction to market turmoil and criticism from allies and corporate leaders.The initial tariff plan involved a 10% baseline duty on most imports, followed by higher “reciprocal” tariffs on countries with perceived unfair trade practices. China faced the harshest penalty, with tariffs raised to a staggering 145% after Beijing announced retaliatory measures.Despite the turbulence, the White House maintained that the transition is necessary. “There will be a transition cost and transition problems,” Trump had previously admitted, “but in the end it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”","The white house strongly defended former president donald trump’s tariffs, saying they were a long-overdue response to decades of economic policies.

Russia's justice ministry said on Friday that it has designated Andrei Kozyrev — a former foreign minister and prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin — as a ""foreign agent"". The Yeltsin-era minister responded to this labelling by calling it ""the stupidity of the regime.""According to Reuters, Kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-Soviet Russia , serving under President Boris Yeltsin in the early 1990s when the country maintained relatively warm ties with the West. Now residing in the United States since 2010, Kozyrev has become an outspoken critic of Kremlin policies and Russia’s military actions in Ukraine .In 2022, after the start of the war in Ukraine, Kozyrev publicly called on his former colleagues in the Russian foreign ministry to resign in protest.The justice ministry accused Kozyrev of spreading false information about Russian government policies and military activities. It also cited his opposition to the war—referred to by Moscow as a ""special military operation""—and his alleged collaboration “with foreign platforms.”Responding to the move, Kozyrev dismissed the designation, saying it reflected ""the stupidity of the regime.""""I am glad to join those noble people who have likewise been designated foreign agents,"" he added.The ""foreign agent"" label, rooted in Soviet-era terminology, carries a strong stigma and requires individuals to publicly identify themselves as such in all publications and online posts. It also imposes strict financial reporting rules.Numerous writers, journalists, and cultural figures critical of the war have faced the same designation in recent years.","Andrei kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-soviet russia.

Denmark started the process of approving a new defence agreement with the United States that will allow American troops to be stationed on its mainland. The Danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on Friday, with a final vote expected by the end of June, says news agency Reuters.According to The Local, the deal gives the US military access to three Danish airbases—Aalborg, Karup, and Skrydstrup—all located in the Jutland region. The significant shift in Denmark’s defence policy is due to the heightened tensions in Europe because of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.Local media Jyllands-Posten, reports that the deal could see armed private security firms, working for the US military, stationed in Denmark. The potential presence of foreign armed personnel has raised eyebrows.The agreement is expected to pass, with several opposition parties backing the minority government. However, left-wing groups like the Alternative and Red-Green Alliance have voiced strong opposition. They argue that the deal compromises Danish sovereignty and opens the door to an American military footprint in the region.A Voxmeter poll found public opinion to be divided—41 percent support the agreement, 33 percent oppose it, and 27 percent remain undecided.Notably, Denmark has made it clear that Greenland, which has been the subject of interest to US President Donald Trump, is not part of this deal. The government has ruled out ceding the territory, even as it deepens its military ties with Washington.","The danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on friday, with a final vote expected by the end of june.
