"Avoid travel outside US, immigration attorneys tell H-1B, F-1 visa holders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avoid-travel-outside-us-immigration-attorneys-tell-h-1b-f-1-visa-holders/articleshow/119135563.cms,"'Visa holders must've contingency plans'

Be it H-1B visa holders and their kin, or international students, or even green card holders, US immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas. India is not on the proposed travel ban list by the US, but still the fear remains.On Monday, TOI reported on similar advice being given to Green Card holders. The reasons range from delays in stamping at US consulates in home country, extreme vetting and cases of secondary inspection, including detention at US airports on return.Kripa Upadhyay, an immigration attorney in Seattle, said, ""This sounds heartless but foreigners (especially those needing to renew H-1B or F-1 visas) must think twice about leaving US right now.""The US department of state has updated eligibility requirements for interview waiver appointments (referred to as dropbox appointments). Earlier, applicants could qualify for interview waiver if they had been issued a non-immigrant visa in any category (except B visitor visas) and were applying within 48 months of expiration. Under revised rules, dropbox is available only to applicants renewing a visa in the same non-immigrant category that has expired within past 12 months. Thus, if you are an international student with an F-1 visa and now need an H-1B you must wait for an interview slot. If you have an H-1B and need an extension, but your earlier visa was issued more than 12 months ago, you must also wait for an interview slot, Upadhyay said.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, said, ""Delays due to visa appointment availability is only part of the concern. We know of individuals stuck in administrative processing for no apparent reason other than additional scrutiny and security clearances. This should not have happened if the individual had been previously approved for a visa multiple times. I think we can expect to see 'extreme vetting' similar to the tenure of the earlier Trump administration.""Also read: Fearing deportation, a Cornell university grad student files a pre-emptive lawsuit If US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has approved an H-1B, the consular officer has the right to refuse the visa and send the application back to USCIS for re-adjudication. Upadhyay added, ""In a situation like this, employees outside the country would be stuck for several monthsbefore they can return to the US."" Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said, ""If travel is unavoidable, visa applicants and their employers should also try to have contingency plans in case of delayed stamping such as continuing work from their home country.""","Us immigration attorneys are advising clients not to travel overseas.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday hit back at Pakistan for labelling PM Modi's remark on the bilateral issues with Islamabad ""misleading and one-sided"".The external affairs ministry said the world knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s ""active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism "" and that Islamabad should ""vacate Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation"".In an interview with with American podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi on Sunday said that “every attempt to foster peace with Pakistan was met with hostility and betrayal” and that he hoped that “wisdom would prevail on the leadership in Islamabad to improve bilateral ties.”Also read: ‘We chose peace, they chose proxy war’: PM Modi on India-Pakistan relations on podcast with Lex Fridman Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan. Take the September 11 attacks, for example. The mastermind behind it, Osama bin Laden—where did he eventually emerge from? He had taken refuge in Pakistan. The world has recognized that in a way terrorism and the terrorist mindset are deeply rooted in Pakistan,"" he said.PM Modi further called Pakistan an ""epicentre of turmoil"", urging its leadership to ""abandon the path of terrorism"" and work towards peace. He also mentioned that the people of Pakistan themselves long for peace, as they have suffered from years of internal unrest and terrorist violence.Reacting to PM Modi's remarks, Islamabad raked up the Kashmir issue and called it an ""unresolved dispute"".“The remarks are misleading and one-sided. They conveniently omit the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remains unresolved for the last seven decades despite India's solemn assurances to the United Nations, Pakistan and the Kashmiri people,” Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement, according to news agency PTI.In a strong-worded rebuttal to Pakistan's statement, the ministry of external affairs called Islamabad a sponsor of cross-border terrorism, which is ""biggest roadblock to peace and security in the region"".""We note that Pakistan has once again made some comments about the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The world knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism. In fact this is the biggest roadblock to peace and security in the region.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday has acknowledged that his initial criticism of India’s stance on the Russia-Ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face."" Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi, Tharoor admitted that India's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a Prime Minister ""who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow"".Tharoor, who had previously called for India to condemn Russia’s aggression, said during a session, ""I am still wiping the egg off my face because I was one of the few in Parliament who criticised India’s position in February 2022.""The Thiruvananthapuram MP explained that his criticism was based on the violation of the UN Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, three years later, he now recognises that India’s balanced approach has allowed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to engage with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky within weeks of each other.""All of those principles had been violated by one party and we should have condemned it. Well, three years later it does look like I am the one with the egg on my face because clearly the policy has meant that India has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine (Zelenskyy) and the president in Moscow (Putin) two weeks apart and be accepted in both places,"" he said according to news agency PTI.With the caveat that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the government as he is in the opposition, Tharoor suggested that India might be open to sending peacekeepers if there was an agreed peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine.He noted that Russia has ruled out NATO peacekeepers, making non-European forces more viable. ""As an Indian parliamentarian, I don’t think there would be strong resistance to the idea,"" he said, citing India's extensive history in peacekeeping missions.Tharoor recalled how, in 2003, India’s Parliament firmly rejected sending troops to Iraq after the US-led invasion. However, he stated, “I don’t see that happening for Ukraine.”India has participated in over 49 UN peacekeeping missions, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to global stability.","Congress leader shashi tharoor has acknowledged that his initial criticism of india’s stance on the russia-ukraine war has left him with ""egg on his face"" he said india's neutral policy has positioned it as a key player in fostering lasting peace and has a prime minister who can hug both the president of ukraine and the president in moscow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119167587,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1121210,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big indian carriers like air india group and indigo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from mumbai’s chatrapati shivaji maharaj international airport (csmia) when the latter gets operational later this summer.

Rajnath asks Netherlands not to supply weapons to terror-sponsor Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-asks-netherlands-not-to-supply-weapons-to-terror-sponsor-pakistan/articleshow/119164682.cms,"Rajnath Singh and Ruben Berkelmans.

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday asked the Netherlands to not provide arms, weapon systems, platforms and military technologies to Pakistan, which has sponsored cross-border terrorism for decades, in a meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Ruben Brekelmans.In the delegation-level meet, India and the Netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, and new and emerging technologies like AI and drones .The clear takeaway, however, was Singh telling Brekelmans that “equipping” Pakistan with defence equipment and technologies “undermines regional security and stability” in South Asia, sources told TOI.“Singh said India has been fighting Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in J&K and elsewhere for decades. India tells all friendly countries that they should not arm Pakistan in any way due to its state policy of fueling terrorism in other countries,” a source added.The Netherlands, for instance, has supplied two Alkmaar-class mine countermeasures vessels or mine-hunters, which were built at the Van der Giessen-de Noord shipyard in Alblasserdam.Similarly, the country is also providing 1,900-tonne multi-role offshore patrol vessels from the Damen Shipyards to Pakistan. “Several Dutch companies are interacting with Pakistan in the military arena, especially in the naval domain,” another source said.India has upped the ante against terrorism and Sikh separatism in recent diplomatic meetings, with PM Modi on Monday seeking continuing cooperation from his New Zealand counterpart Christopher Luxon to rein in pro-Khalistani separatists in his country.Parallelly, Singh also told US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that the Trump administration should designate Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India for promoting secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities, as a foreign terrorist organization, as was reported by TOI.In the India-Netherlands meet on Tuesday, the two sides also explored the possibilities of collaboration in shipbuilding, equipment and space sectors, “optimizing the complementariness in skills, technology and scale of the two countries”.“They also discussed working together in domains like AI and related technologies, besides connecting the defence technology research institutes and organizations of the two countries,” a defence ministry official said.With India developing a “vibrant innovation and industrial ecosystem”, New Delhi also said Dutch armament companies should be encouraged to integrate Indian vendors into their supply chains.Singh said he was “delighted to meet the young and dynamic defence minister of the Netherlands, and the two reviewed the full range of bilateral defence cooperation. “We look forward to further deepening and elevating our defence partnership,” he said.","India and the netherlands decided to elevate their bilateral ties in areas like defence, security, information exchanges, maritime cooperation in the indo-pacific.

NEW DELHI: India and China should be partners contributing to each other's success and a cooperative ""pas de deux"" between the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for the two countries, Beijing said while welcoming PM Modi's ""positive"" remarks in a podcast in which he had endorsed signs of a rapprochement in ties since Oct last year.In the interaction with Lex Fridman, Modi had also strongly backed Donald Trump's policies and the US president even shared the podcast on his social media platform, Truth Social.Modi had said on Sunday that the border situation with China was normalising since his meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan in Oct and trust would return in the relationship ""slowly but surely"". Seeking a cooperative relationship, he also said it was natural for India and China to have differences, and the focus should be on ensuring that these don't turn into disputes.Building upon PM Modi's remarks, the Chinese foreign ministry said that Sino-Indian ties were characterised by mutual learning and friendly exchanges for over 2,000 years."" China appreciated PM Modi's recent positive statements. The successful meeting between President Xi and PM Modi in Kazan last Oct provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties. Both sides have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings of our leaders, strengthened exchanges and practical cooperation at all levels, and achieved a series of positive outcomes,"" a ministry spokesperson said, responding to a question at a media briefing.The official added China stood ready to work with India to implement the understandings that both leaders had reached in their meeting.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his debut on Truth Social on Monday and was quick to respond to US President Donald Trump, who had shared a link to Modi’s recent podcast with AI researcher Lex Fridman.In his reply, PM Modi thanked Trump and highlighted the broad themes he covered in the podcast, including his personal journey, India’s civilisational outlook, and global issues.“Thank you, my friend, President Trump. I’ve covered a wide range of topics, including my life journey, India’s civilisational outlook, global issues, and more,” PM Modi wrote on Truth Social.Trump had earlier posted a YouTube link to PM Modi’s extensive conversation with Fridman, which lasted nearly three hours.In the podcast, the Prime Minister Modi spoke at length about his experiences with Trump, their close working relationship, and his admiration for Trump’s leadership style. He recalled key moments such as the grand ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston in 2019 and shared how Trump had personally taken him on a guided tour of the White House, detailing historical facts without notes.PM Modi also commended Trump’s resilience after the recent assassination attempt, stating that his unwavering commitment to America reminded him of his own “Nation First” principle.PM Modi’s arrival on Truth Social is significant, as the platform is primarily associated with Trump’s supporters and conservative voices in the US. His first post read, “Delighted to be on Truth Social! Looking forward to interacting with all the passionate voices here and engaging in meaningful conversations in the times to come.”Trump has often praised PM Modi, calling him a “tough and better negotiator,” a remark the Indian leader addressed in the podcast, saying that while he appreciated the compliment, his focus has always been on India’s interests in any negotiations. PM Modi also noted that Trump appeared more prepared for his second presidential term, suggesting that he had a clearer roadmap and well-defined goals.The exchange between the two leaders comes at a crucial time, as India and the US are engaged in negotiations over trade tariffs.Trump has previously criticised India’s high tariff rates, while the Indian government has assured a parliamentary panel that no firm commitments have been made yet, with discussions ongoing.","Prime minister narendra modi responds to us president donald trump on truth social.

The Paris Agreement is a globally agreed goal to strive to limit warming to 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels.“While a single year above 1.5 degree C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are out of reach, it is a wake-up call that we are increasing the risks to our lives, economies, and to the planet,” said WMO secretary-general Celeste Saulo.The report attributed the record global temperatures, seen in 2023 and broken in 2024, to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, coupled with a shift from a cooling La Niña to warming El Niño event.It, however, noted that several other factors may have contributed to the unexpectedly unusual temperature jumps, including changes in the solar cycle, a massive volcanic eruption and a decrease in cooling aerosols.The report also shows the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at the highest levels in the last 800,000 years, and the rate of sea level rise has doubled since satellite measurements began in 1993.Around 90% of the extra heat trapped by GHG is absorbed by the ocean, causing it to warm and affecting marine life, weather patterns, and sea levels. The report shows that the ocean continued to warm in 2024, reaching record high levels.The sea level rise has cascading damaging impacts on coastal ecosystems and infrastructure, with further impacts from flooding and saltwater contamination of groundwater.“Our planet is issuing more distress signals -- but this report shows that limiting long-term global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is still possible. Leaders must step up to make it happen -- seizing the benefits of cheap, clean renewables for their people and economies - - with new national climate plans due this year, ” said United Nations secretary-general António Guterres.","Year 2024 may be the warmest calendar year on record with a global mean near-surface temperature of 1.55 degrees celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900 average) but the long-term warming (averaged over decades) remains below 1.5 degrees c, says the world meteorological organisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185045,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32382,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The attacker and the victim were put on a par,"" said S Jaishankar, who has in the past too hit out at the West for its preoccupation with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while ignoring similar threats in the Indo-Pacific.Jaishankar also underlined the importance of having a fair and strong UN, saying there was a need for a different international order, just like there was need for a new domestic order.Without naming Pakistan, he said it was not just big countries that benefited from the lack of order.""Any country which takes risks, has extreme positions, tests the system, will use disorder to its advantage. We've seen in our own neighbourhood, you don't have to be a big country to be a risky country. We have some smaller neighbours who have done a pretty good job at that,"" the minister said.""We should all understand the importance of order. The old order was a product of its times... Its virtues were exaggerated because the rule maker and the rule taker had different perspectives. If you were at the receiving end of some of those rules, you had issues. If it suits your interest, somebody is good, not good... you apply that order to the same country on the same issues, differently,"" he added.The minister went on to cite the example of Myanmar which has been targeted by the West for its military rule but not Pakistan, again without naming the country. ""We have military rule to our east - in Myanmar. They are a no-no. But we have them even more to the West. You know where? They seem to be okay. I think it's important to audit the working of the world for the last eight decades and be honest about it and to understand today that the balances, the shareholdings in the world have changed. We need a different conversation. We frankly need a different order,"" he said.",S jaishankar slams selective application of global rules on sovereignty and territorial integrity.

There's increasing focus on defence cooperation. How can Sweden contribute to the Make in India initiative?



Sweden shunned long-standing neutrality to join NATO last year. Are you disappointed with the way Trump has targeted the organisation?



Can India still play a role in ensuring peace?



It’s important for like-minded democracies to together uphold the rules-based order , whether in Ukraine or in Indo-Pacific where China is posing challenges, Sweden’s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard tells TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview. Excerpts:We came up with our strategy last year and it's on the side of defence. We are seeing how security in the world is becoming interlinked. The worst example of this is North Korean troops being present on the Russian side in the war against Ukraine. It shows how small the world has become, and we need cooperation among democracies who believe in the rules-based order. There is great interest in the Indo-Pacific in many parts of the world. We see potential here for enormous growth but also tensions. For instance, we see how China is challenging the rules-based order, the law of the sea, in the South China Sea.We have substantial cooperation already in place in defence. It's a big step that Swedish company Saab is coming here to produce the Carl Gustaf (shoulder-launched weapon system). We will both benefit from this cooperation and there is also potential as regards the defence industry. Sweden is very strong in that area, and with these many tensions in the world, there is great potential.My interpretation of the new administration is that they are 100% committed to the alliance. Pete Hegseth (secretary of defence) has said he would like to deepen the cooperation. I think the US intends to be a good ally. Having said that, I think their criticism against European countries, and also Canada, of not spending enough on their own security is absolutely legit. Sweden has done its homework. So, we have doubled our investments in the military in four years and we are heading for more. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The best way of keeping the US interested in European security is to show that we are interested in European security. Trump is trying to find a solution (to the war). We are very pleased with the agreement in Jeddah for a proposed ceasefire and now the pressure is on Russia. It's up to Russia to show they want to lay down their weapons. I'm not sure they will want that. Trump has contributed to that and for that we are grateful.I think India is a very important country standing up for the rules-based order. I'm convinced that India has a very important role to play regarding this. But it has to be peace that is fair and does not allow Russia to go back to its people perceived as winners, invest more heavily in their military and then return to attack another friendly country. Our full support for Ukraine (including Sweden's military aid) is a prerequisite for them to be able to negotiate from a position of strength. It's important for Ukraine to be in a position to say no to a bad deal.","It’s important for like-minded democracies to uphold the rules-based order, says maria malmer stenergard.

Addressing the Raisina Dialogue, she said America First is similar to PM Modi's commitment to India First.""This is the expectation of any leader's commitment to their people to serve them and to put their interests at the forefront of their decisions.
