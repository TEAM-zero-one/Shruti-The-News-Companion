Congress questions Modi

’s stance on key issues

Concerns over trade, immigration, and climate

Modi’s meeting with Elon Musk also under scrutiny

Modi-Trump talks set against growing bilateral tensions

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high-profile meeting with US President Donald Trump, the Congress on Thursday questioned whether he would ""summon up the courage"" to raise India’s concerns over the treatment of deported Indian citizens and other critical issues, including trade, immigration, and climate policies.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, posed a series of questions to Modi, urging him to confront Trump on recent deportations. “Will Modi tell Trump that India would send its own aircraft—like Venezuela and Colombia—to bring back deportees in the future?” Ramesh asked.He also criticized the government's concessions to the US, including slashing import duties on farm produce and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and amending the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damages Act, 2010, to benefit US firms.The Congress leader pressed Modi on whether he would oppose Trump’s policies, including his stance on Palestine and his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and the WHO. Ramesh also raised concerns about “racist attacks” on H1B visa holders, the majority of whom are Indians.“Will Mr Modi tell President Trump that attacks on H1B visa holders—over 70% of whom are Indian youth—are unacceptable? H1B visas have benefited both countries,” Ramesh stated.The Congress also questioned Modi’s upcoming meeting with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, asking whether India would insist on Tesla manufacturing in India rather than merely assembling vehicles.“Will Modi uphold his policy of auctioning spectrum instead of administrative allocation, and ensure that security considerations remain non-negotiable for satellite internet providers like Starlink?” Ramesh added.Modi, currently on a two-day visit to Washington, is set to meet Trump in the first bilateral talks of Trump’s second term. The visit comes amid concerns in New Delhi over Trump’s ""America First"" trade policies and immigration stance, as well as recent deportations that sparked outrage in India.The meeting will be closely watched for Modi’s response to these pressing concerns and whether he takes a firm stand on India’s interests.","Congress general secretary jairam ramesh, in a post on x, posed a series of questions to modi, urging him to confront trump on recent deportations.

Focus on trade, immigration, and strategic partnerships

Intelligence cooperation and emerging threats

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set for a high-profile diplomatic engagement during his two-day visit to the United States, holding crucial meetings with US President Donald Trump, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.Amid concerns over Trump’s ""America First"" trade policy and stringent immigration measures, Modi’s key priority will be to safeguard India’s economic interests and preempt any punitive trade actions.Modi’s schedule also includes a bilateral meeting with President Trump at the White House, followed by a joint press statement and a dinner hosted by the US leader. This marks Modi as the fourth foreign leader to meet Trump since his inauguration on January 20.In addition to trade and investment, the talks are expected to cover energy, defense, and technology collaborations.PM Modi’s visit follows the US administration’s recent deportation of 104 Indians in shackles, sparking criticism in India. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had assured Parliament that New Delhi is working with Washington to prevent mistreatment of deportees.Earlier, Modi met with Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence, discussing counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing initiatives. With rising global security threats, India and the US are keen to strengthen their strategic partnership.As Modi continues his engagements with key US leaders and business figures like Musk and Ramaswamy, the visit is expected to set the tone for India's future relations with the Trump administration. The optics and outcomes of Modi’s meeting with Trump will be closely watched, with trade, immigration, and security remaining at the forefront.","Prime minister narendra modi is set for a high-profile diplomatic engagement during his two-day visit to the united states.

Modi-Trump meeting a ‘good sign’ for India: Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: In a significant diplomatic engagement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with US President Donald Trump today, marking one of the earliest high-level interactions of the Trump administration . Congress MP Shashi Tharoor emphasized the importance of this meeting, highlighting its strategic implications for India-US relations.""It's fairly significant that our Prime Minister is one of the first world leaders to meet President Trump. That's a good sign,"" Tharoor said. ""If I am not mistaken, he is the fourth head of government to arrive in Washington, and the Trump administration is not even one month old. So this is a very significant thing.""While the specific agenda of the talks remains undisclosed, Tharoor underscored key issues that India would likely prioritize. ""There are trade issues with Trump talking about tariffs. There are issues to do with the H-1B visas for legal Indian immigration. There are issues concerning the manner in which illegal immigrants were sent back and treated in very inhumane ways. That will also have to be addressed.""Tharoor also pointed to global geopolitical concerns that could feature in the discussions. ""There may be some conversations, who knows, on Ukraine. PM Modi has been to both Ukraine and Russia. President Trump took an initiative today with both countries. So there are a lot of issues. It is difficult for us to sit here and guess what they might discuss. I think we should wait for the readout.""Reflecting on India's growing role in global alliances, Tharoor noted, ""There is, for example, the development of the Quad that may come up. India is supposed to be hosting a Quad summit. Where will that go? Will Trump agree to come to India? So many issues. Let's wait and see.""The meeting underscores India's early engagement with the new US administration, setting the stage for critical discussions on trade, immigration, and global security concerns.",Modi-trump meeting a ‘good sign’ for india: shashi tharoor.

Poll Should Defense Deals Be Prioritized Over Other Sectors? No, Economic Growth Matters More Yes, Security Comes First

NEW DELHI: India has formally offered the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems to France at the highest-level, even as it finalises direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from the country and collaboration in construction of three additional Scorpene submarines.During his talks with President Macron, PM Modi invited the French Army to take “a closer look” at the Pinaka, emphasizing that an acquisition of this system by France would be “another milestone” in the bilateral defence ties.India is already exporting the Pinaka to Armenia, while some Asean and African countries have also shown interest in acquiring the system. DRDO has developed a variety of ammunition for the Pinaka, including rockets with 45-km extended range and 75-km guided extended range, and the plan is to further enhance them to 120-km and then to 300-km.The India-France joint statement said both sides also welcomed the ongoing discussions in missiles, helicopter engines and jet engines. A collaboration between French major Safran, which already makes helicopter engines in India, and DRDO to co-develop the 110 Kilonewton jet engine for the Indian fifth-generation stealth fighter project called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft) is under discussion, as reported by TOI earlier.India’s impending Rs 63,000 crore acquisition of 22 single-seat Rafale-Marine jets and four twin-seat trainers to operate from indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which is now with the PM-led cabinet committee on security for the final nod, did not find mention in the joint statement.It, however, did refer to the impending Rs 33,500 crore project for construction of three additional diesel-electric Scorpene submarines at the Mumbai-based Mazagon Docks (MDL) in collaboration with the French M/s Naval Group. These three will add to the first six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines constructed at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.Modi and Macron “commended” the collaboration in construction of Scorpene submarines in India, including indigenization, and in particular the work carried out towards integrating the DRDO-developed air-independent propulsion (AIP) into the Scorpene submarines and the analyses conducted regarding the possible integration of the integrated combat system into the three new boats.Macron also welcomed India’s joining the multi-nation `Eurodrone’ medium-altitude, long-endurance remotely-piloted aircraft programme, which he said is another step forward in the growing strength of our partnership in defence equipment programmes.","India has formally offered the indigenous pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems to france.

Scandal To Self-Reliance: MP Surya Flies In Indigenous HTT-40,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/scandal-to-self-reliance-mp-surya-flies-in-indigenous-htt-40/articleshow/118204245.cms,"BENGALURU: Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya Thursday lauded defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and called its HTT-40, in which he flew a sortie at Aero India, a symbol of India’s self-reliance and technological prowess. HTT-40 is an indigenous trainer aircraft .“Flying the HTT-40 was an incredible experience. This aircraft is a testament to India’s engineering excellence and a shining example of how, with the right policy and support, our scientists and engineers can achieve anything,” he said.Terming HTT-40 the pride of India and Bengaluru, he said it stands as a shining example of what the country can achieve with the right leadership and unwavering support for our scientific institutions. Taking a dig at the UPA government, Surya said HTT-40 represents India's journey from scandal to self-reliance, from foreign dependency to Atmanirbharta.“...In 2012, under the UPA, India procured Swiss Pilatus trainer aircraft through a Rs 3,000 crore deal. However, the procurement process was later riddled with irregularities, leading to a CBI inquiry in 2019, which revealed the involvement of middlemen in the deal. Consequently, Pilatus was blacklisted, leaving India in urgent need of an indigenous training aircraft,” Surya said.The indigenous trainer programme, which had initially faced setbacks, gained momentum in 2014 under PM Modi’s administration and then-defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s guidance, he said, adding that HAL successfully developed the aircraft.The HTT-40 features a four-bladed turbo-prop engine, glass cockpit, and advanced safety systems including a zero-zero ejection seat.“This achievement is dedicated to the late Manohar Parrikar, whose vision for self-reliance in defence was instrumental in reviving the indigenous trainer programme. The HTT-40 was inaugurated by him and today, it stands as a symbol of India’s transformation in defense manufacturing,” Surya said.The success of HTT-40 would not have been possible without the relentless efforts of HAL’s chief designers, Suma Prakash and Ramanand, along with an entire team of engineers, scientists, and workers.With HAL now producing low-cost, high-performance combat aircraft, several nations, particularly from the Global South, are showing interest in acquiring Indian-made fighter jets, Surya said.Surya is the second politician to fly in an aircraft in this edition of the show. On Tuesday, civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu flew in HAL’s Hindustan Jet Trainer (HJT-36) which was renamed ‘Yashas’. The aircraft was piloted by an HAL test pilot.","Bengaluru south mp tejasvi surya lauded defence psu hindustan aeronautics limited (hal) he called its htt-40, in which he flew a sortie at aero india, a symbol of india’s self-reliance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118204459,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-815339,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The statement came on the heels of an open letter signed by more than 70 Hindu organisations that also denounced Hinduphobia in the US media.Gabbard, who is Hindu-American and was the first US Congresswoman to take her oath on the Bhagavad Gita; had faced scrutiny in media on her religious identity. In what was seen as a demonstration of unity, religious leaders representing diverse faiths and communities from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh traditions had issued the interfaith coalition letter urging the media to reject anti-Hindu prejudice and embrace balanced and respectful reporting.Besides Chahal, signatories of the letter included Hakim Ouansafi of the Muslim Association; Bishop Mesrop Parsamyan of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, representing Eastern Orthodox Christians; Archbishop Timothy Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, a leading voice in the Catholic community; Dr Jeffery D.

Several articles in US media had linked Gabbard to the Science of Identity Foundation and its leader Chris Butler.The coalition’s letter condemned the “recent biased portrayal of Hindus in the media”, citing concerns about the promotion of anti-Hindu bigotry, which misrepresents spiritual organisations and individuals. “Media has recently published content that not only promotes Hinduphobia but also biases against individuals and organisations from multiple faith backgrounds,” the letter said.","Sukhjit (sukhi) singh chahal congratulated former congresswoman tulsi gabbard on her us senate confirmation as director of national intelligence (dni) the statement came on the heels of an open letter signed by more than 70 hindu organisations that also denounced hinduphobia in the us media.gabbard, who is hindu-american, had faced scrutiny in media on her religious identity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118203997,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-733232,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Modi, Macron seal deals on N-energy to power AI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-macron-seal-deals-on-n-energy-to-power-ai/articleshow/118196236.cms,"PM Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron

India and France adopted a roadmap for cooperation in AI and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation, as PM Narendra Modi and President Emmanuel Macron held bilateral talks, reaffirming their strong commitment to the strategic partnership between the 2 countries.Among the major takeaways was an agreement for jointly developing and producing advanced and small modular reactors that could hold the key to powering the energy-intensive AI industry in both countries. The leaders discussed regional and global issues like the West Asia situation and Russia-Ukraine war and enhanced their Indo-Pacific partnership with an agreement for triangular cooperation to promote sustainable development in third countries in the region.While no agreement was signed in defence, Modi and Macron welcomed cooperation in building air and maritime assets in line with the 2024 defence industrial roadmap. In a special gesture, the leaders travelled together in the French presidential aircraft to Marseille where they held delegation-level talks, visited a war cemetery and inaugurated the new Indian consulate. Macron hosted a private dinner for Modi and later also went to the airport in Marseille to see off the Indian PM.Four of the agreements signed were in areas related to technology and innovation. While the leaders didn’t address the media, they acknowledged in a joint statement India-France civil nuclear ties and efforts in cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, notably in relation with the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant Project. They welcomed the partnership for co-designing, co-developing and co-producing advanced modular reactors (AMR) and small modular reactors (SMR). India has been in touch with the US, Russia and France for the past couple of years for jointly developing the technology and the issue is likely to figure in Modi’s engagements in the US too on Thursday. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said cooperation in SMR and AMR is important also for AI, recalling International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol’s remark that AI essentially means electricity. “And the amount of electricity that will be needed, if it is going to be sustainable, then it has to be something like nuclear power-driven electricity. And that is the area in which SMRs and AMRs can play a key role. It can also help us tackle complications in conventional projects,’’ said Misri.The leaders also agreed to work closely on implementing the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEEC) initiative, stressing its importance for connectivity, sustainable growth and access to clean energy. In this regard, they acknowledged the strategic location of Marseille in the Mediterranean Sea, said the joint statement.The leaders also underlined their common commitment to a free, open, inclusive, secure and peaceful Indo-Pacific region, where France is a resident power. On trilateral cooperation in the region, Misri said the choice of projects will be driven by host countries. “These are demand-driven initiatives and not supply-driven initiatives. And we feel that it is important for us to provide choices to countries, amongst our partners, with regard to development cooperation pathways. And I think India and France have a certain alignment in their thinking about this kind of cooperation,’’ he said.There was focus also on skill development and vocational education as the leaders welcomed the operationalization of the Young Professionals Scheme (YPS), under India-France Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA), which is expected to facilitate two way mobility of youth and professionals,France reiterated its firm support for India’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council as Modi and Macron emphasised the urgent need for the reform of the Council. “The two leaders agreed to strengthen conversations on regulation of use of the veto in case of mass atrocities. They held extensive discussions on long-term global challenges and current international developments and agreed to intensify their global and regional engagement, including through multilateral initiatives and institutions,’’ said the joint statement.France joined India in unequivocally condemning all forms of terrorism including, importantly for India, cross-border terrorism and called for the disruption of terrorism financing networks and safe havens. “They further agreed that no country should provide safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts. The leaders also called for concerted action against all terrorists, including through designations of individuals affiliated with groups that are listed by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee,’’ said the joint statement.","India and france adopted a roadmap for cooperation in ai and concluded 9 other agreements, including 3 to boost civil nuclear cooperation.

This sale surpassed even Japan's famed Wagyu and India's Brahman breeds, demonstrating the immense value of Ongole cattle when developed with proper care and scientific breeding.This breed is auctioned at regular intervals. In one such auction in 2023 at Arandu, Brazil, Viatina-19 fetched $4.3 million. Last year, it fetched around $4.8 million.Originally native to AP's Prakasam district, Ongole cattle are known for their unique genetic traits, including exceptional physical strength, heat resistance, and superior muscular structure. These qualities make them highly desirable for dairy. However, while the breed struggles for attention and preservation in India, countries like Brazil have harnessed its full potential, generating enormous wealth through its fine germplasm.Viatina-19's superior genetic lineage has also earned her the ""Miss South America"" title at the prestigious Cow Champion of the World pageant.She now holds a place in Guinness World Records as the most expensive cow ever sold.

India has formally offered the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems to France at the highest-level, even as it finalises direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters from the country and collaboration in construction of three additional Scorpene submarines .During his talks with President Macron, PM Modi invited the French Army to take ""a closer look"" at the Pinaka, emphasising that an acquisition of this system by France would be ""another milestone"" in bilateral defence ties.India is already exporting the Pinaka to Armenia, while some Asean and African countries have also shown interest in acquiring the system.
