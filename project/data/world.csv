"Tharoor: PM’s dynamism, willingness to engage a ‘prime asset’ for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tharoor-pms-dynamism-willingness-to-engage-a-prime-asset-for-india/articleshow/122037082.cms,"Tharoor said the very composition of the foreign outreach teams after Op Sindoor, featuring MPs from diverse parties and faiths, was a potent message in itself

New Delhi : Disregarding Congress brass’s frowns, its MP Shashi Tharoor has said PM Narendra Modi ’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a “prime asset” for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.“The diplomatic outreach following Operation Sindoor was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,” Tharoor wrote in an article published in The Hindu.“While the immediate military action was decisive, the subsequent diplomatic outreach was equally, if not more, vital in shaping global perceptions and consolidating international support,” the Thiruvananthapuram MP said in the article that was referred to by PMO on its X handle.Tharoor had earlier raised his party leadership’s hackles by praising Operation Sindoor and by agreeing to head one of the parliamentary delegations to sensitise global opinion to the necessity of India’s military retaliation following the Pahalgam terror attack . His party had questioned govt picking members of the delegation.His fresh praise for the PM can only widen the MP’s gulf with the party brass. It also coincides with a fresh flurry of Congress attacks on Modi, this time for not “unequivocally condemning” the US for bombing Iran.Some in the party said Tharoor, unlike many of his colleagues, did not repost on X an article by Congress parliamentary party chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Gaza and Iran.In contrast, BJP highlighted Tharoor’s praise for the PM. Reflecting on his experience of leading the delegation that visited the US and other countries, Tharoor said the very composition of the delegations, featuring MPs from diverse political parties, different states and varied faiths, was a potent message in itself.“It underscored that when it comes to national security and confronting terrorism, India speaks with one voice. This transcended domestic political differences, imbuing our message with greater credibility and gravitas in the eyes of our international interlocutors,” he said.","Shashi tharoor has said pm narendra modi’s energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a ‘prime asset’ for india on the global stage.

Airlines react to crisis with advisories and diversions

White House monitoring crisis from Situation Room

Iran late Monday launched a barrage of missiles targeting the US-operated Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, triggering loud explosions across Doha and Lusail. The strike came just hours after Qatar closed its airspace as a precaution, and was later confirmed by Iranian state television as a direct response to recent US attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Iranian media hailed the strike as “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression,” accompanied by martial music during the broadcast. Israeli sources, quoted by Axios, claimed the missiles specifically aimed at US positions within the Al Udeid base -- the largest American military facility in the Middle East.Residents in Doha reported hearing a series of deafening explosions, with AFP noting that the night sky lit up with visible projectiles. While there was no immediate confirmation from US or Qatari authorities regarding the extent of damage or potential casualties, embassies, including India's, swiftly issued advisories urging citizens to stay indoors.US President Donald Trump downplayed the scale of the Iranian retaliation, describing it as “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered.” In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was ‘set free,’ because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction.”“I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system,’ and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,” Trump added, signalling hopes for a de-escalation.Trump also extended thanks to Iranian authorities for what he described as an “early notice,” which allowed the US to preemptively take defensive measures. “Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,” he said.In another post, Trump thanked the Emir of Qatar and emphasised that there were no Qatari casualties either. “I’d like to thank the Highly Respected Emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking Peace for the Region. In addition to no Americans being killed or wounded, very importantly, there have also been no Qataris killed or wounded,” Trump said.He ended his remarks with a dramatic flourish: “CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!”“In view of the ongoing situation, Indian community in Qatar is urged to be cautious and remain indoors. Please remain calm and follow local news, instructions, and guidance provided by Qatari authorities,” read an official statement from the Indian embassy in Doha. “The Embassy will also keep updating through our social media channels.”Two US officials later confirmed to Reuters that there were no American casualties from the attack. The officials said Iran had used both short- and medium-range missiles in the strike, with most intercepted before causing significant damage.The missile count, according to Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, mirrored the number of bombs dropped by the US during its recent air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The council stressed that the selected base was “far from residential areas” and posed no threat to Qatar, described as “our friendly and brotherly neighbour.”Qatar’s foreign ministry meanwhile said the situation was “under control,” although the underlying tensions continue to reverberate across the region. Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, temporarily halted air traffic, adding to the widespread disruption.Amid the uncertainty, airlines adjusted operations in and around Qatar. IndiGo issued a travel advisory, noting, “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace.”Air India Express confirmed two Qatar-bound flights had been diverted. “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and the suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha-bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur,” a spokesperson said.“We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew… We regret the inconvenience due to circumstances beyond our control,” the airline added.The White House confirmed that US President Donald Trump was in the Situation Room with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General John Caine. Reuters reported that the senior leadership team was actively monitoring developments as the crisis unfolded.The Iranian attack followed a surprise joint US-Israeli strike on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend -- a move that Tehran had warned would trigger “unpredictable consequences.” Al Udeid Air Base is a critical hub for US military operations in the region, housing the Combined Air Operations Center and the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing — the largest such unit in the world.In a message posted on X just before the attack, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared, “We neither initiated the war nor seeking it. But we will not leave invasion to the great Iran without answer.”","Trump downplays iranian response, urges ‘peace’: ‘congratulations world, it’s time for peace’embassies issue warnings as airspace closures disrupt flights.

Israel-Iran conflict: Air India halts all flights to Middle East; Europe and US east coast also affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/israel-iran-conflict-air-india-halts-all-flights-to-middle-east-europe-and-us-east-coast-also-affected/articleshow/122032920.cms,"NEW DELHI: The closure of UAE and Qatar airspace late Monday night as missiles were fired from Iran towards US bases in Qatar and Iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear. Hundreds of lights to and from the region — that houses mega hubs like Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi along with multiple smaller ones like Sharjah — were impacted.Flights headed there from across the world, including multiple Indian cities, were diverted, returned to origin or were put on hold. Flights headed from Lucknow to Dammam; Mumbai to Kuwait and Amritsar to Dubai were among those that turned back to the origin from over the Arabian Sea. And aircraft supposed to take off from there, remained on the ground.Early on Tuesday morning, Air India said it has ceased “all operations to Middle East as well as to and from the East Coast of North America and Europe with immediate effect, until further notice. Our India-bound flights from North America are diverting back to their respective origins and others are being diverted back to India or re-routed away from the closed airspaces.”AI says this due to “the developing situation in the Middle East. ”“We request the understanding of all passengers who may be affected by this disruption that’s beyond an airline’s control. Air India is in continuous consultation with its external security advisors and is vigilantly monitoring the evolving situation. We will keep our passengers informed of any updates. The safety and security of our passengers and staff remain our number one priority,” said an Air India spokesperson.The India market is served by biggies including Emirates Group, IndiGo, Air India Group, Qatar Airways, Etihad and multiple smaller airlines like Akasa, SpiceJet and Air Arabia. Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi are key transit points for travel between India and rest of the world. Dozens of flights to and from India alone were impacted on Monday night itself.In a statement, IndiGo said: “In view of the evolving situation in the Middle East, some of our flights may experience delays or diversions. These adjustments are being made to ensure operations remain within safe and compliant airspace. We recommend checking your flight status regularly. If your flight is impacted, alternate options can be easily explored through our website. We continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with the relevant authorities. We appreciate your patience and understanding.”An AI Express spokesperson said: “As a result of the ongoing situation in the Middle East and suspension of Qatar airspace, Air India Express has diverted our Doha bound flight from Kochi to Muscat and returned our flight bound from Kannur. Air India Express has no aircraft on the ground in Qatar. We are monitoring the situation closely and will take all necessary precautions for the safety and security of our guests and crew, with inputs from the relevant authorities… regret inconvenience. ”The airspace closure in the region started around 9 pm (IST) when Qatar closed its airspace for commercial airliners “to ensure safety of citizens, residents, and visitors.” As a result, a large number of flights headed to Doha — including many from Indian cities — were impacted. The enroute ones diverted to other nearby places like Abu Dhabi or Bahrain; some returned to their origin cities in India; boarding for those about to depart was put on hold and others were suspended till the airspace restrictions remain in force.The point-to-point trafic between India and Doha is rather low, with the majority being one-stop transit flyers. IndiGo, the biggest Indian operator to Doha, saw the maximum impact. Its enroute flights to Doha from Delhi and Hyderabad were diverted to Bahrain and one from Kochi went to Abu Dhabi. Comments were sought from Qatar Airways and awaited till the time of going to press.Air India’s three flights were immediately impacted: one was diverted to Abu Dhabi, other returned to India and the third was put on hold. AI Express put boarding of its Doha-bound flights on hold at Indiana airports. AI Express has flights between Doha and six Indian cities — Kannur, Kochi, Kozhikode, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Tiruchchirappalli. Multiple flights headed from the west to Doha diverted to nearby cities including Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.Within an hour, the UAE airspace was also closed. That threw flights completely ot of gear. “At this point, there’s utter chaos and we can’t even guestimate the impact,” said senior official of multiple airlines.","The closure of uae and qatar airspace late monday night as missiles were fired from iran towards us bases in qatar and iraq threw commercial air traffic completely out of gear.

Tharoor has 'exposed' Rahul

NEW DELHI: Shashi Tharoor , whose frosty ties with the Congress leadership is now an open secret, has yet again taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the global diplomatic outreach following "" Operation Sindoor "".In an article published in The Hindu, Tharoor said: ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's energy, dynamism and willingness to engage remains a prime asset for India on the global stage but deserves greater backing.""""The diplomatic outreach following 'Operation Sindoor' was a moment of national resolve and effective communication. It affirmed that India, when united, can project its voice with clarity and conviction on international platforms,"" the Congress leader wrote in the article.Tharoor had led one of the seven multi-party delegations to convey India's stand following the Pahalgam terror attack and the military operation.Only last week, Tharoor had admitted to ""differences of opinion with some in party leadership"". Ironically, Shashi Tharoor's latest round of praise for PM Modi comes on a day the Congress made a notable electoral victory in Kerala wresting the Nilambur assembly seat from the LDF after nine years.Tharoor had stayed away from party's campaign in Nilambur bypoll. While the Congress MP had said that he was not invited, the Congress maintained that his name was in the list of star campaigners for the bypoll.The Congress had dubbed the Nilambur bypolls as the semi-finals ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year. The win will give the party a boost as it goes all out to wrest power from the LDF after 10 years.Tharoor's praise for the Prime Minister comes at a time when the Congress has been consistently attacking the Modi government over its foreign policy, alleging that Indian diplomacy is being ""shattered"" and the country stands ""isolated"" globally.Following the Pahalgam attack, Tharoor has made several comments on the India-Pakistan conflict and the diplomatic outreach that are at variance with the stand taken by the Congress party. Led by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress has been questioning the government over US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating a ceasefire between the two countries.The BJP was quick once again to use Tharoor's remarks to target the Congress as it has done several times in the past few months. The party took a swipe at the Congress over Tharoor's article and said the Thiruvananthapuram MP has ""exposed"" Rahul Gandhi. BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said on X, ""Shashi Tharoor admits that PM Modi's dynamism and global outreach are a strategic advantage for India.""The Prime Minister's Office did its bit to return favourt to the Congress MP and shared Tharoor's article on X and said, ""Lok Sabha MP and former Union Minister Dr. Shashi Tharoor writes- Lessons from Operation Sindoor's global outreach.""","Shashi tharoor has taken a diametrically opposite stand from his party.

‘Ironic for Pakistan to talk about human rights’

NEW DELHI: India on Monday strongly rejected “unwarranted and factually incorrect references” made about the country during the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of foreign ministers’ meeting.“These statements, driven by Pakistan, which has turned terrorism into statecraft, reflect the continued misuse of the OIC platform for narrow political ends,” the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said in a detailed statement.The MEA criticised the OIC for its continued failure to acknowledge the “real and documented threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan,” citing the recent terror attack in Pahalgam as a recent example.“This reflects a wilful disregard for facts and the global consensus on the fight against terrorism,” the ministry added.India firmly reiterated that the OIC has “no locus standi to comment on India's internal affairs, including Jammu & Kashmir,” which the ministry described as “an integral and sovereign part of India, a fact enshrined in the Indian Constitution and irreversibly settled.”Calling the OIC’s silence and actions troubling, the MEA warned the organisation of the “perils of allowing Pakistan’s propaganda to hijack and politicise its agenda,” and said that continuing on this path would “undermine the OIC’s credibility and relevance.”Responding to comments made by Pakistan at the OIC meeting, India said they were nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract from Islamabad’s “appalling record of state-sponsored terrorism, minority persecution, sectarian violence, and governance failure.”India also rejected Pakistan’s allegation of “unprovoked and unjustified military aggression” and defended its counter-terror operation post-Pahalgam.“Operation Sindoor was a precise and legitimate act of self-defence against terrorist camps operating from Pakistani territory,” the MEA said, adding that Pakistan’s retaliatory efforts were reckless, endangered civilians, and resulted in multiple civilian casualties.In its closing remarks, the ministry said it was “ironic” for Pakistan, a country with an “abysmal human rights record” and a “history of sheltering, breeding and empowering terrorists”, to lecture others on counter-terrorism and human rights.",India rejects 'unwarranted and factually incorrect references' made about the country at organisation of islamic cooperation (oic) council of foreign ministers’ meeting.

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari threatens India over Indus Waters Treaty suspension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilawal-bhutto-zardari-threatens-india-over-indus-waters-treaty-suspension/articleshow/122033312.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a blunt warning on Monday to India over its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), saying Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.Speaking during the budget session of the National Assembly, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said, “India has two options: share water fairly, or we will take it from all six rivers.” He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.The remarks came nearly two months after India suspended the IWT. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan-based militants for the assault, triggering fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Bilawal argued there is no clause allowing unilateral withdrawal. “India’s claim that the treaty is in abeyance has no legal basis. According to the UN Charter, cutting off water is a form of aggression,” he said.He warned that if India pursued this course, it could lead to open conflict. “We do not want war, but if water is used as a weapon,” he said. “Pakistan will be forced to act — and we are in a position to defeat India just as we have before,” he claimed.Bilawal also urged India to resume dialogue, particularly on counterterrorism coordination. “Without engagement, violence will only increase in both countries,” he warned, adding that Pakistan’s own fight against terrorism had been undermined by Indian attempts to “politicise the issue”.The former FM also accused India of misusing global platforms to target Pakistan. “When we got off the FATF grey list, India tried hard to reverse it through lobbying and misinformation. But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin. Under the treaty, India has control over the eastern rivers – Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.",Bilawal bhutto zardari says pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated.

"In UP village, forgotten Indian roots of Ayatollah Khomeini",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-up-village-forgotten-indian-roots-of-ayatollah-khomeini/articleshow/122010671.cms,"KINTOOR (BARABANKI): In Kintoor, a tranquil village of 13,000 nestled along the Ghaghara, 70 kilometres from Lucknow, only five Shia families remain. Among them, the Kazmis claim a distant kinship with Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, grandfather of Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, the fiery cleric who ignited Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and became its first Supreme Leader.Born in Kintoor in the early 19th century, Ahmad’s journey from this unassuming village wove a legacy that reshaped West Asia’s history. He left India, escaping colonial rule in 1830, migrating to Najaf, and then finally settling in Khomeyn in 1834. Hence the family name.A portrait of Ruhollah Khomeini still hanging in his drawing room, septuagenarian Syed Nihal Kazmi says, “My great-great-great-grandfather Mufti Mohammad Quli Musavi and Syed Ahmad Musavi were cousins. Ahmad’s story began here in Kintoor, but he became Iran’s forever.” The village, once a vibrant hub of Shia scholarship in the kingdom of Oudh, is concerned with the war in West Asia.BBC journalist and author Baqer Moin, in his book Khomeini: Life of the Ayatollah, writes that Syed Ahmad Musavi Hindi left Kintoor around 1830, drawn to Najaf, Iraq, for pilgrimage. There, he befriended Yusef Khan Kamarchi, a landowner from Farahan, near Khomeyn, Iran.Persuaded by Yusef, Ahmad settled in Iran in 1839, purchasing a sprawling house and garden in Khomeyn that remained in the family for over a century.Ahmad went to become a Twelver Shia cleric. From his third wife, Sakineh Ahmad, who was his friend Yusef’s sister, Ahmad had three daughters and a son, Syed Mostafa, father of Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad died in 1869 and was buried in Karbala.The Musavi family’s roots trace back to Nishapur (or Neyshabur), Iran, over 2,500 kilometres from Kintoor. “In the early 18th century (1700), they migrated to India, settling in Kintoor,” Moin notes. The family, Musavi Syeds, claimed descent from the Prophet through his daughter and the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim, a lineage rooted in Nishapur.Syed Adil Kazmi, Nihal’s youngest son and an LLB graduate, says, “Our ancestors’ journey from Nishapur to Kintoor, and Ahmad’s return to Iran, tied two worlds together.”Today, Iran’s defiance under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei echoes Khomeini’s unyielding spirit. “Long before Khamenei or the 1979 revolution led by Khomeini, it was Ahmad, born in our Kintoor, whose choice to settle in Iran changed West Asia’s discourse,” Adil says.From Ahmad’s departure to Khomeini’s revolution, Kintoor’s quiet lanes hold stories of faith, migration, and a family that bridged continents, leaving an indelible mark on history.Kintoor’s legacy also includes Justice Syed Karamat Husain, a Musavi Syed who rose to the position of a judge at the Allahabad high court and founded the Karamat Husain Muslim Girls’ PG College in Lucknow, championing education for women.","The kazmis claim a distant kinship with syed ahmad musavi hindi, grandfather of ayatollah ruhollah musavi khomeini.

There’s a running meme on X, the hellhole formerly known as Twitter, where a doctor asks a patient: “Do you have a history of mental illness in your family?” To this, the patient replies: “I have an uncle who believes Iran is close to a nuclear weapon for the last 50 years. ”Perhaps that’s why Operation Midnight Hammer – a blow-by-blow remake of– was carried out with such haste that even half of Donald Trump’s base were still railing against it as the bombs dropped on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan.While Iran’s Godot-like wait for nuclear weapons continues, it’s illustrative to see how India, a nation that didn’t evoke very warm feelings from Uncle Sam in the past, became a nuclear superpower. How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?The truth is that politicians of various vintages played a part, irrespective of their worldview or political leanings. Every one of them was of the opinion that the Ayatollahs of Potomac (a delightful term coined by TOI legend K Subrahmanyam, the father of the current external affairs minister) couldn’t be the only ones with the power of the sun in the palm of their hands.As George Fernandes, the erstwhile Defence Minister of India in the Vajpayee government, summed up this grit: “I am not a former socialist; I am a socialist. I am not a former pacifist; I am a pacifist. I am even today an anti-nuclear weapon man. But as a defence minister of the country, I will do whatever is best to protect its border, and if that means nuclear bomb, then why not?”When pressed on how one could do so at the risk of contradicting oneself, Fernandes dug deep into the Lord Krishna rationale that one’s dharma trumps all contradictions, pointing out: “Yes, even at the cost of contradicting oneself, even at the cost of dying.If the security of the country requires me to die, I shall die. It’s about being realistic. It’s about being patriotic.”While with the benefit of hindsight, it might seem inevitable that the land that gave the world the Bhagavad Gita would come up with nuclear weapons, here’s the tale of how it went down.Let’s say you haven’t seen, skipped physics class, and think “fusion” is what happens when you have tandoori gravy momos.To understand nukes, we need to rewind to 1905, when a wild-haired Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein wrote four papers that changed science forever.One of them suggested that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. A few months later, he dropped a tiny but terrifying equation: E = mc². That means energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Since light travels really fast — about 300 million metres per second — squaring it makes even a small amount of mass release a huge amount of energy.So, how do we turn that into a weapon? That’s where nuclear physics steps in.Certain heavy atoms like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are naturally unstable. If you shoot a neutron at them, they split — releasing heat, radiation, and more neutrons. Those neutrons hit other atoms, which split too. It’s called a chain reaction — kind of like a viral WhatsApp message, but instead of arguments, you get a mushroom cloud.That’s how atomic bombs work. The ones dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki used two designs:Both use Einstein’s idea: a little mass disappears, and a huge burst of energy takes its place. There’s also the hydrogen bomb, which is even more terrifying, but beyond the scope of this piece.By the 1960s, nuclear weapons were the privilege of a select five—America, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China—enshrined as permanent members of the global atomic aristocracy, the kind that liked to invade Vietnam in their spare time and host disarmament conferences in their downtime.There is something about nukes and their miasma. Once you have them, you don’t want others to get them. You start doing everything in your power to stop anyone else from joining this super-exclusive club, because deterrence is always more comfortable when it’s a monopoly.And then in 1974, India came knocking—with Smiling Buddha, gatecrashing the party with a silent explosion in the Rajasthan desert. If Israel was the nuclear sphinx, India was the grinning intruder who didn’t wait for an invitation.How did a socialist, beggared and non-aligned country acquire nuclear weapons? It all started with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Fabian socialist who wasn’t beyond making a Faustian deal if it was for the nation’s betterment. While he publicly championed atomic energy for rural electrification, privately he laid the groundwork for a weapons programme.Enter Homi Jehangir Bhabha—part physicist, part institution-builder, all ambition, played with élan by Jim Sarbh in the heavily fictionalised Rocket Boys, whose cheekbones are capable of setting off a different sort of chemical reaction.A Cambridge-trained genius with a velvet accent, Bhabha envisioned a self-sufficient Indian nuclear complex. He set up the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948 and Trombay’s Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) soon after.His three-stage nuclear plan was audacious: heavy water reactors for plutonium, fast breeder reactors for more fissile material, and eventually, thorium-based systems.In 1955, India obtained the CIRUS reactor from Canada, with heavy water courtesy the United States—both under the Atoms for Peace programme. It was a masterclass in strategic procurement.Enter the dragon. In 1962, Chinese troops stormed Indian posts in Ladakh and Arunachal. The result wasn’t just military humiliation; it was psychological trauma. Nehru aged a decade overnight. And two years later, when China tested a nuclear bomb in Lop Nur, India realised it wasn’t just behind—it was vulnerable.And then came the prodigal daughter. Indira Gandhi had no qualms about the world or any delusions about power. By the early ’70s, the scientific community—led by Raja Ramanna, P.K. Iyengar, and M.R. Srinivasan—had weaponised the plutonium harvested from CIRUS.On May 18, 1974, India conducted its first nuclear test in Pokhran, Rajasthan. Codenamed Smiling Buddha, because what better name for a nuclear bomb than the progenitor of peace, the device yielded around 8 kilotons, billed as a “peaceful nuclear explosion”. Canada fumed and threw a Trudeau-level fit. The US imposed sanctions. But much like she did when Richard Nixon threatened her during the Bangladesh Liberation War, Indira Gandhi didn’t flinch.From 1974 to 1998, India lived in nuclear ambiguity. We had tested a bomb—but never declared a doctrine. This era, later dubbed ""recessed deterrence"", saw India perfect the art of silent readiness.Prime Ministers like Morarji Desai were openly anti-nuclear. Others, like Rajiv Gandhi, were more nuanced—calling for universal disarmament while funding missile programmes.In this period, India commissioned the Dhruva reactor for weapons-grade plutonium. Ballistic missiles like Prithvi and Agni were tested under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, overseen by Dr. Abdul Kalam.Still, New Delhi avoided another test. The 1985 NPT Review Conference slammed the door shut on India’s membership. But India refused to sign a treaty that said: “You can’t have nukes, but the P5 can.”By the 1990s, India was ready. And P.V. Narasimha Rao, India’s philosopher-king of pragmatism, knew it. In 1995, with the Clinton administration distracted by Yeltsin’s vodka diplomacy and Pakistani warlords, Rao greenlit preparations for Pokhran-II. Shafts were drilled. Scientists were mobilised. Dr. Kalam, Dr. R. Chidambaram, and their teams stood by.Then, American satellites picked up movement. The CIA raised alarms. A New York Times exposé spooked Washington. Clinton dialled Delhi. Rao, deadpan as ever, stonewalled. The tests were paused.But he didn’t stop the programme. Instead, he ensured everything stayed intact—ready for a more audacious successor.As legend has it, Rao whispered to Atal Bihari Vajpayee before leaving office: “Everything is ready. You just have to press the button.”Rao never took credit. But when the mushroom clouds rose in 1998, they bore his blueprint.On May 11 and 13, 1998, India conducted five nuclear tests. Codename: Operation Shakti.This time, it wasn’t a “peaceful” explosion. It was a declaration. Fission and fusion devices were tested. Thermonuclear capability was claimed (though some scientists later debated the yield).Prime Minister Vajpayee announced: “India is now a nuclear weapons state.” Sanctions came. Condemnations followed. India shrugged.The team that delivered this feat:Pakistan tested six devices in response. South Asia was officially a two-bomb region. But India’s message was clear: deterrence, not domination.Having proven its capabilities, India now wanted respect.In 2005, under Manmohan Singh , India signed the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement with President George W. Bush. It was historic. For the first time, a non-NPT country gained access to civilian nuclear trade.The deal was backed by the US Congress, the IAEA, and the NSG. It marked India’s transformation from global pariah to trusted partner—without dismantling a single warhead.Critics cried foul. Proponents hailed it as a realpolitik victory. For India, it was simple: we earned the bomb. Now we wanted the fuel.The bomb was never the endgame. It was the insurance policy. A radioactive reminder that India wouldn’t be bullied into compliance or bribed into silence. The scientists were the magicians, the politicians their illusionists. But behind them stood a civilisation that never wanted conquest—only the right to decide its destiny. From Bhabha’s lab bench to Vajpayee’s launch pad, India’s nuclear odyssey was built on a foundation of paradoxes: peaceful atoms turned potent, idealism wrapped in pragmatism, and restraint forged through power.Today, India’s nuclear arsenal isn’t about posturing. It’s about posture—calm, calculated, credible. We built the bomb not to drop it, but to make sure no one else could.So the next time someone scoffs at Indian statecraft, remind them: we cracked open the atom, outfoxed the CIA, kept our doctrine unspoken, and still walked into the world’s nuclear club with our head held high. We didn’t explode to destroy. We exploded to exist. And that, in the final analysis, is how you detonate a dream.","How did a newly freed, partition-bruised, socialist-leaning, and largely illiterate country go from famine queues and imported milk powder to becoming one of the world’s most improbable nuclear powers?

In a stunning shift on the eve of New York City’s Democratic primary, Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani has overtaken former Governor Andrew Cuomo in a pivotal ranked‑choice voting simulation, according to a fresh Emerson College–PIX11–The Hill poll released today.Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy reacted to the poll and urged New Yorkers to move to Ohio.

Blake Lively devastated as Taylor Swift cuts all ties

Legal troubles add fuel to the fire

After years of red-carpet glam, family vacations, and public admiration, the once-adored friendship between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift has reportedly come to a painful end—this time, for good. According to multiple insider sources, the fallout is not only personal but now tangled in legal drama, forcing Lively to surrender private texts to the legal team of actor Justin Baldoni . The emotional toll appears to be heavy on Lively, while Swift remains distant—and firmly supported by her current inner circle, including NFL star Travis Kelce The bond between the ""Gossip Girl"" actress and the global music sensation had been iconic. Taylor Swift, godmother to Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ three children—James, Inez, and Betty—was often seen vacationing and celebrating milestones with the couple. But those memories have now faded into silence.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out. She’s heartbroken, but she knows it’s time to let go. Taylor’s not coming back,” a source told Radar Online.Another insider close to Swift confirmed the emotional rupture: “The friendship is done.” The source alleged that Lively “exploited the Godmother of her children and manipulated the public into thinking that she was watching out for her best interests.”The emotional heartbreak coincides with a troubling development in the legal arena. Blake Lively has been ordered by a judge to submit her text exchanges with Swift in connection to Justin Baldoni’s ongoing sexual harassment case.The ruling stems from Lively herself identifying Swift as someone with whom she discussed workplace grievances.Reports also suggest Lively may have allegedly used her connection with Swift as leverage. Rumors swirled that Lively had threatened to release past messages unless Swift publicly supported her during the controversy.Taylor Swift, who was dramatically subpoenaed in the case, has attempted to maintain her distance. Yet, her silence has been interpreted as a deliberate break from the actress she once trusted.Through the storm,Swift isn’t alone. Kelce, her current partner and Kansas City Chiefs star, has remained low-key but steady in his support. While Kelce hasn’t spoken publicly about the situation, insiders close to the singer say he’s been a “calming force” during the fallout.With Taylor Swift preparing to release her next album, rumored to address themes of betrayal and trust, Kelce’s presence has reportedly been “grounding” for the Grammy-winner.Also Read: Taylor Swift breaks from Blake Lively after shocking betrayal as Travis Kelce becomes her emotional shield While the headlines continue to swirl, one thing is certain—this is no longer just celebrity gossip.

The final decision, it seems, was not so much a moment as a mood.

Trump's two-week bluff?

The public indecision masked a fast-moving, tightly held operation that unfolded just 36 hours later.

Trump's demand: zero enrichment, full dismantlement. Iran's answer: no.

Bunker Busters: The bomb that digs to destroy

A calculated gamble

Trump just did it.





In a move that marks a dramatic escalation in US-Iran tensions, American President Donald Trump ordered a high-precision military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, authorising the first major US military action on Iranian soil since the fall of the American-backed Shah in 1979.The operation, carried out by a small fleet of US B-2 stealth bombers, was planned under intense secrecy and executed just hours after Trump returned from his New Jersey golf club to the White House. In classic Trump fashion, he announced the strike minutes after it concluded, ""Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this.The White House later released tightly controlled photos from the classified Situation Room, showing Trump, wearing his signature red MAGA hat, flanked by his war cabinet. CIA director John Ratcliffe, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were present, though national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard was conspicuously missing, amid rumours of internal friction.Photos blurred key documents on the table, echoing the Obama-era images of the 2011 Bin Laden raid. But where Obama's photos suggested deliberation and calm, Trump's leaned into theatrics—Though Trump projected uncertainty all week, publicly musing on whether he might ""take two weeks"" to decide, the internal gears of war were already in motion. By Thursday, he had approved detailed attack plans. By early Saturday morning, seven B-2s were already airborne.""It was a ruse,"" a senior administration official admitted, according to The Washington Post.Only a tight circle of aides were read in: VP JD Vance, CIA chief Ratcliffe, defense secretary Hegseth, national security envoy Steve Witkoff, and secretary of state Marco Rubio, among others. Some in the broader White House apparatus were in the dark until the bombs had already fallen.Trump's claim that he might take ""two weeks"" to decide on striking Iran was a calculated deception, designed to throw Tehran off balance. Behind the scenes, however, the decision had already been made, and stealth bombers were preparing for takeoff. A senior administration official later admitted the delayed talk was ""our attempt to throw the Iranians off guard,"" though there was “some truth” to it, according to The Washington Post.At the heart of the conflict: Iran's refusal to halt its nuclear fuel enrichment program, an issue that has vexed American presidents for decades. In Geneva last week, European diplomats met with Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, but the talks stalled. Tehran wouldn't budge unless the bombing stopped. Trump, in turn, wouldn't stop unless Iran surrendered its nuclear future.This time, the ultimatum came with an unmistakable threat: Trump warned Tehran to ""immediately evacuate"" and told Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei that ""he could be next.""Despite the bombast, Trump never spoke to Iranian officials directly. Instead, Witkoff held backchannel negotiations.While B-2s sped across the Atlantic, Trump wasn't in a bunker, he was at a fundraiser. Vice President JD Vance was flying back from California. The air of normalcy masked the imminent shockwave.But inside the Situation Room, the president's loyal cadre assembled. Among them: social media gatekeeper Dan Scavino, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and even AG Pam Bondi, who hadn't been involved in the planning but was brought in at the eleventh hour.Outside the government, Trump's populist whisperers, Steve Bannon, Charlie Kirk, and Jack Posobiec, were kept in the loop to shore up political backing. The strike wasn't just a military message, it was a campaign moment in the making.""He was listening to people across the ideological perspective"" of his political base, The Washington Post quoted the senior administration official.""Ultimately, the president felt this is a decision the base should support and get behind, because ultimately, he's preventing a conflict that very well could have happened if the supreme leader instructed Iran to create the nuclear weapon,"" he added.The strike was timed precisely, coming just days after Israel launched its own offensive against Iran on June 13. By midweek, Israeli air dominance helped tilt US military calculations toward optimism.Ret. Lt. Gen. Charlie ""Tuna"" Moore put it bluntly: ""Although we could have executed our operation unilaterally, without a doubt it was beneficial to the United States to have that as the predicate.""Even VP Vance, who had privately raised concerns, ultimately signed off.

'This is our Berlin wall moment'



Reza Pahlavi pushes for regime change; US unsure







Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, urged Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down now if he wants to get a fair trial, something that Reza said Khamenei never gave to any Iranian. Reza Pahlavi announced that he was ready to take the regime over and he was setting up a new secure platform for dissidents and internal opponents of the regime to coordinate their efforts to overthrow the disctatorrshio and put the country on the path of a ""free and democratic"" future.“We are a proud, ancient and resilient people,” Pahlavi told a press conference in Paris on Monday. “To my compatriots: This is our moment. I am with you. Let us build this new Iran together.”“I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road of peace.”Pahlavi said he has spoken with people across Iran and realized that this is Iran's Berlin Wall moment. ""But like all moments of great change, it comes fraught with danger. We stand at a crossroads. One road leads to bloodshed and chaos. The other—to a peaceful and democratic transition,"" he said.The destruction of the Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow has diminished the regime's domestic nuclear enrichment, he said. ""But it does not diminish the regime’s intent to acquire and use nuclear weapons. The regime, enraged and emboldened, will be seeking revenge and can acquire nuclear weapons from other rogue regimes like North Korea,"" he said.Reza Pahlavi offered his plan for transition and national renewal based on three core principles: Iran;s territorial integrity, individual liberties and equality of all citizens, and separation of religion and state.""We have already launched the Iran Prosperity Project (IPP) , a comprehensive plan for the economic reconstruction and social stabilization of our country in three phases. The Emergency Phase of the first 4-6 months, the Establishment Phase of 18-24 months, and the Normalization Phase which is long term,"" he said.While the exiled crown prince pushed for a regime change in Iran, the US is not certain of what it wants. Vice President JD Vance categorically said the US is not in a war with Iran and is not attempting regime change in Iran.But President Donald Trump contradicted that claim and said if the current regime in Iran is unable to 'Make Iran Great Again', then why there would not be a regime change.""It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change', but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to Make Iran Great Again, why wouldn't there be a Regime Change?

Iran’s underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo was struck again on Monday, Iranian state television reported, a day after the United States bombed the facility using heavy bunker-buster bombs in a major escalation of the ongoing conflict.The Israeli military confirmed on Monday that it launched air raids to “obstruct access routes” to the Fordo facility, stating that the strike was intended to cut off movement around the enrichment site.“Israeli forces struck in order to obstruct access routes to the Fordo enrichment site,” the military said. US President Donald Trump had earlier said the Fordo site had been “totally obliterated” in Sunday’s US strike.In Vienna, Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Sunday’s attack likely caused heavy destruction at the sensitive facility. “Given the explosive payload utilized and the extreme vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred,” Grossi noted. He added that the IAEA has yet to fully assess the underground impact.The US described its Sunday strike on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan as a one-time operation to damage Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.However, President Trump warned that more strikes could follow if Iran retaliates. Iran condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and likened it to an invasion.On Monday, Iran responded by launching missiles and drones toward Israel, targeting cities such as Haifa and Tel Aviv. Explosions were also heard in Jerusalem. Iranian state television said the barrage was part of a new wave under “Operation True Promise 3.” Israel activated its defence systems and advised residents in northern and central areas to take shelter.Iranian General Abdolrahim Mousavi, chief of the joint staff, warned that the US airstrikes had given Iranian forces a “free hand” to act against American interests and forces in the region. Tens of thousands of US troops are stationed across the Middle East, many within range of Iran’s short-range missiles.Amid rising tensions, global calls for restraint have grown. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged a return to diplomacy and warned that Iran’s potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route, would be “extremely dangerous.” The EU said Iran must be ready to return to direct talks with the US to help resolve the crisis.The conflict comes against the backdrop of the collapse of the 2015 nuclear agreement. After the US withdrew from the deal during Trump’s first term, Iran began enriching uranium up to 60% purity and restricted access to international inspectors. On Monday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key Iranian ally.","Israel confirms monday strike, says aim was to block access to fordo.

In a significant escalation of regional tensions, Iran launched several missiles targeting US base in Qatar on Monday night, specifically striking the Al Udeid Air Base, the largest American military installation in the Middle East. The attack came in direct retaliation for the recent US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, according to Axios, which cited an Israeli official.Shortly after Qatar shut its airspace as a precaution, loud explosions were heard across Doha and Lusail, and projectiles were seen streaking through the night sky, according to eyewitnesses and AFP journalists.Iran’s state television broadcast footage of the strike, accompanied by martial music, with a caption declaring it “a mighty and successful response by the armed forces of Iran to America’s aggression,” Reuters reported. Iran's military later confirmed that the missile strike on Al Udeid was “devastating and powerful.”Iran’s top security body issued a statement saying that its armed forces used the same number of bombs that the US had deployed during its attack on Iranian nuclear sites. The statement added that the base targeted was far from urban and residential areas in Qatar and emphasized that the operation posed no threat to its ""friendly and brotherly"" neighbour Qatar.The missile campaign, dubbed ""Annunciation of Victory"" by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, was part of a broader response that also included attacks on US bases in Iraq, according to a security official cited by the AP.Meanwhile, Bahrain, home to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, issued a public alert urging citizens to remain calm and proceed to the nearest safe location. The US Embassy in Doha, along with other Western embassies, advised residents to shelter in place until further notice.Qatar’s foreign ministry acknowledged the attack and said the country “reserves the right to respond directly and in accordance with international law.” However, it reassured the public that the security situation remains stable and stated that Doha is working closely with regional and international partners to de-escalate tensions.The Al Udeid Air Base, located southwest of Doha, houses thousands of American troops and serves as a critical operational hub for US military activities across the Middle East.In a related development, the Israeli military announced that approximately 15 fighter jets, under the guidance of the IDF Intelligence Directorate, carried out a series of strikes on missile and UAV storage sites in western Iran. Targets included underground military infrastructure and arms depots linked to the Iranian Armed Forces, according to a statement posted on the IDF's official Telegram channel.As of now, there has been no official response from the US Department of Defense or CENTCOM regarding the Iranian missile strike, including details on damage or casualties.","Iran launched several missiles targeting us base in qatar on monday night, specifically striking the al udeid air base, the largest american military installation in the middle east.
