"Delhi blast probe: Cops suspect highly unstable TATP, ammonium nitrate behind car explosion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-suspect-highly-unstable-tatp-ammonium-nitrate-behind-car-blast/articleshow/125354421.cms,"‘Very Bleak Message To World’: South Africa Envoy Condemns Delhi Blast And Seeks Joint Action

NEW DELHI: Investigators probing Monday's Delhi blast suspect that triacetone triperoxide aka TATP could be one of the key components of the IED that was in the car that exploded on Monday evening near Red Fort. At least two-three kg ammonium nitrate and fuel oil might also have been used along with other chemicals, which would have taken the bomb's weight to 40-50kg, sources said.A large bag, presumably containing the improvised-explosive device, was kept on the rear seat of the i20 being driven by Dr Umar Un Nabi, who died in the blast, CCTV footage revealed earlier. The bag had occupied almost half of the rear seat, indicating the size of the IED. The impact of the blast was such that it was felt 50 metres underground and body parts were thrown in a 50-metre radius.Nicknamed ‘mother of satan', TATP is extremely unstable, highly sensitive to shock, heat, friction and electrostatic discharge. However, it can help build ""military-grade equivalent IED"", capable of impact amounting to almost 80% power of TNT (trinitrotoluene).If confirmed in the official detailed explosive report, which is yet to be submitted by National Security Guard and the forensics, it will add more clarity to the investigation, cops said.""It's dangerous to handle in any quantity; accidental detonation during manufacturing or transportation is common,"" said a senior security establishment officer.This would mean that bomb may not have needed a detonator and could have exploded due to heat or other factors. As an IED assembler, Umar knew this and that's why he took the car to a crowded area, said sources.Police earlier suspected that the blast might have been ""accidental"", a theory which now seems plausible in the wake of a blast at Srinagar's Nowgam police station on Friday. ""That's why there were no shrapnel or pellets at the spot though car bombs don't need them as their own parts act as shrapnels,"" said an officer.TATP's primary ""advantage"" is the ease of obtaining its precursor chemicals, acetone and hydrogen peroxide. They are easily available from common household products.Forensic experts said ammonium nitrate is an oxidiser and the main component in many industrial explosives, most famously ANFO (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil). Peroxides, especially concentrated hydrogen peroxide, are also powerful oxidisers.""Along with other things, explosives typically require a combination of a strong oxidiser and a fuel (a combustible material, often organic like fuel oil, aluminium powder or glycerine) to create a high-energy, detonable mixture,"" said an FSL officer.Researchers have even explored hybrid explosives that combine hydrogen peroxide and ammonium nitrate as the oxidising phase, along with a fuel. ""These mixtures are specifically designed to be powerful explosives, sometimes performing similarly to standard ammonium nitrate-based explosives,"" said a bomb disposal squad member. ""Mixing the oxidisers with with a fuel creates a highly energetic and potentially unstable material,"" he added.","Triacetone triperoxide aka tatp could be one of the key components of the ied that was in the car that exploded on monday evening near red fort.

What trends in Bihar show

What did the exit polls say?

As trends in the Bihar assembly election results emerge, NDA alliance has taken decisive leads across the state with Mahagathbandhan trailing. However, one name that is notably absent from the numbers is Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj. Despite promises to reshape Bihar’s political landscape, the results so far show no significant traction for the party.According to latest trends, the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) sweeping elections with Mahagathbandhan lagging behind.The early picture is dominated by the two major blocs:NDA has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the BJP and JD(U) registering strong performances.Mahagathbandhan (MGB) trails behind, with RJD performing significantly better than alliance partner Congress — but still not matching the NDA’s spread.RJD, despite MGB trailing overall, is showing up as one of the top individual parties in several seats.Jan Suraaj, however, does not appear in the early seat charts, and its vote share — where visible — is marginal, rarely impacting the margins in competitive constituencies.The Jan Suraaj Party contested its maiden elections this month with more than 200 candidates in the fray. The party, formed by poll strategist Prashant Kishore, initially announced plans to contest all 243 seats in the Bihar Assembly.The number dipped slightly after Jan Suraaj faced defections, ‘forced’ withdrawals, and other setbacks during the nomination process.Prashant Kishor, the election strategist turned politician, set an ambitious victory target for his party in the state assembly elections. He had also stated that if his party fails to achieve this, he will consider it a personal defeat.However, all exit polls predicted a dismal performance for Prashant Kishore’s Jan Suraaj Party in the Bihar assembly elections . The maximum number of seats any pollster is willing to give to the party is five. While Kishore himself did not contest the polls, his party’s vote share numbers will determine whether they have been able to make any significant dent in the votes of either the NDA or the Mahagathbandhan.","Nda has surged past the majority mark early in the day, with both the bjp and jd(u) registering strong performances. Mahagathbandhan (mgb) trails behind, with rjd performing significantly better than alliance partner congress — but still not matching nda’s spread.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125317939,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1114053,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

CJI on '79 rape ruling: 'Moment of institutional embarrassment'

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: Admitting that Supreme Court failed its citizens, and it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable over the years, the CJI termed SC's 1979 verdict as a ""moment of institutional embarrassment"" which acquitted two policemen accused of raping a young tribal girl inside a police station by taking her ""consent"" as voluntary because there were no visible marks of physical resistance.Delivering the 30th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture, CJI B R Gavai said the apex court's verdict in Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, also known as the Mathura case, was an institutional failure, and court's verdict reflected a deeply regressive and patriarchal understanding of consent, effectively denying the social context of power, coercion, and vulnerability in which sexual violence often occurs.""In my view, this decision remains one of the most troubling moments in India's constitutional and judicial history, and I call it a 'moment of institutional embarrassment', where the legal system failed to protect the dignity of the very person it was meant to safeguard. Yet, this judgment also became a turning point. The public outrage and the nationwide protests that followed, led by women's groups, students, and legal activists, ignited the modern Indian women's rights movement.It compelled the nation to confront the inadequacies of its criminal law and catalysed the amendments in criminal law, which redefined the concept of consent and strengthened legal protections against custodial rape,"" CJI Gavai said.The CJI was speaking on the evolution of law in building a gender equal and inclusive India. He said many pathbreaking laws were passed to bring gender justice, and courts also pitched in to ensure equality through judicial pronouncements, barring few exceptions like the 1979 verdict. He said it resulted in dismantling of the structural inequalities embedded in family and custom, bringing women from the margins of dependency to the centre of constitutional citizenship.""Over the past 75 years, India has charted an extraordinary journey in advancing the rights of women and shaping the vision of an inclusive society. From the early struggles for recognition and equality, to the present era of intersectional and participatory justice, the courts have often stood as guardians of equality and human dignity. This evolution has not been without its challenges. There have been moments when judicial interpretations failed to capture the lived realities of women or fell short of the transformative spirit of the Constitution. .. However, the vigilance of civil society, the persistence of women's movements, and the courage of ordinary citizens have together kept the judiciary accountable to the constitutional promise of equality,"" he said.""Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that progress in gender justice has never been the achievement of courts alone. The collective voice of citizens has ensured that regressive precedents were questioned, debated, and ultimately corrected through reform, reinterpretation, or legislative intervention. The dialogue between the courts and the people thus remains one of the most vital sources of India's democratic strength, reminding us that the march toward gender equality is not a destination reached, but a commitment constantly renewed,"" CJI Gavai said.",Cji b r gavai calls 1979 rape verdict a'moment of institutional embarrassment' he says it is the vigilance of civil society and courage of ordinary people which have kept the judiciary accountable.

NEW DELHI: In a major booster shot for military capabilities in eastern Ladakh, India on Wednesday operationalised its new Nyoma airbase close to the frontier with China, even as a large Army exercise called 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' is now under way in Arunachal Pradesh on the eastern front.The developments at the opposite ends of the 3,488-km LAC underscore the high military readiness being maintained along the China frontier. ""There is ongoing reset in bilateral diplomatic ties. Military CBMs are also being progressively strengthened but the trust deficit on the ground remains high,"" a senior officer told TOI. ""With no de-escalation along LAC, troops will continue to be forward deployed for 6th successive winter since multiple Chinese incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020,"" he said.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh himself flew a C-130J 'Super Hercules' aircraft from Hindon on the outskirts of Delhi to the Mudh airfield at Nyoma, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, to formally inaugurate the strategically located airbase. He was accompanied by Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Jeetendra Mishra.Located just about 35 km from the LAC, Nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth Rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway, a new ATC complex, hangars, crash bay and accommodation, as was earlier reported by TOI.The Mudh airfield is now fully capable of handling and sustaining operations by heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. Primarily, it will help quickly rush troops, weapons and supplies to areas such as Pangong Tso, Demchok and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026 though high altitude will be a limiting factor. China has assiduously upgraded all its airbases facing India over the last five years to offset the terrain constraints due to high-altitude and rarefied air, which limits the weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.China now has additional fighters, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters, as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones deployed at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports all along the LAC.In the far reaches of the Eastern Himalayas, thousands of soldiers from the 3 Spear Corps of the Indian Army, along with elements of IAF, ITBP and others, are now also engaged in the 'Poorvi Prachand Prahar' exercise in the high-altitude terrain of Mechuka and other areas of Arunachal Pradesh.From airlift and force projection to mountain warfare manoeuvres and multi-domain integrated operations, the exercise aims at validating rapid mobilisation, operational logistics and precision-strike capabilities. ""The right force must reach the right place at the right time during conflicts,"" an officer said.While Nyoma will be another operational base for the IAF in Ladakh after Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and the Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground), India has also progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, civil ALGs in the middle sector (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC are also now being increasingly used for military purposes.","Indian air force opens nyoma airbase in ladakh, a strategic game-changer along the china frontier.located just about 35 km from the lac, nyoma has undergone an upgrade worth rs 230 crore, which included extending the original airstrip into a 2.7-km 'rigid pavement' runway.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125286003,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1011904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Candace Owens explains her list of “verifiable lies” told after Charlie Kirk’s assassination





Image via Candace/Podcast

She said the first lie was the story that Mikey McCoy had “blood all over him.” She said this story was made up and was told by Pastor Rob McCoy.

The second lie, she said, came from Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. She said they pushed a story that Charlie Kirk was a “committed evangelical” who only liked Catholic buildings. Owens said this was not true.

The third lie was a strange story that Charlie Kirk’s “strong bones” stopped a 30-06 bullet. She said Andrew Kolvet pushed this and that it made no sense.

The fourth lie, she said, was the claim that Charlie “never blinked” in his support for Israel. Owens said this was not true.

For the fifth lie, she said TPUSA told people that Mikey McCoy first called his dad during the crisis. Owens said this story was also false.

The sixth lie was about Terryl Farnsworth, the AV worker. She said TPUSA claimed police told him to remove cameras. Owens said her video review shows this did not happen.

The seventh lie was the claim that Farnsworth moved SD cards because “people were stealing them.” She said this made no sense because SD cards are cheap and cameras are expensive.

The eighth lie came from Alex Clark, who said there was “no bad blood” between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. Owens said that was “propaganda.”

The ninth lie was that TPUSA’s yearly audits proved nothing odd. Candace Owens said this was misleading because Doge worked differently from normal TPUSA work.

The tenth lie was calling Mikey McCoy a “hero.” Candace Owens said this was not fair because he did not call 911 right away.





Candace Owens spoke on her podcast on November 13, 2025. She said she found ten “verifiable lies” that she believes Turning Point USA (TPUSA) told after Charlie Kirk was killed. Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The next day, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson was arrested for the shooting. Owens said she will keep talking about this case because she feels she is getting “very close” to the real truth, and she believes some people at TPUSA are upset with her for this.In her show, Candace Owens said TPUSA gave wrong or confusing stories about what happened that day. She said some stories made people sound more heroic, more loyal, or more important than they really were. She also said some stories changed facts about Charlie Kirk, his beliefs, his staff, and what happened at the scene.Candace Owens then shared the ten lies she says TPUSA spread.

Seahawks mourn Kenny Easley: Hall of Fame safety dies at 66, cause still not public



Dialysis three times a week





A full kidney transplant in 1990





A long recovery that forced him to rebuild his life away from football





More coverage from NFL:







When news broke that Seattle Seahawks legend Kenny Easley had passed away at 66, the NFL world felt the shock instantly. Fans, former teammates, and Hall of Fame members all reacted with the same heavy silence because the Enforcer wasn’t just a player. He was a presence. And now that voice is gone.Easley died on November 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the Pro Football Hall of Fame and his family. But one crucial detail remains unknown: no cause of death has been released.And that mystery has left many revisiting the long, difficult health journey that shaped Easley’s life long after he left the field.But what we do know is this: no official source has linked his death to any past health condition. Until the family or medical authorities release more information, the cause of death remains undisclosed.This silence has left fans wondering especially because Easley had a well-documented medical history that dramatically changed the course of his life.Long before his Hall of Fame induction, Easley suffered through one of the toughest medical battles an athlete can face.In the late 1980s, he was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, a severe kidney disorder that ultimately ended his NFL career at just 28 years old.At the time, it shocked the league, he was in his prime, playing at an elite level, and widely considered one of the greatest safeties of his generation.The situation grew more painful when Easley later revealed the underlying cause. In a lawsuit, he claimed that excessive ibuprofen use, a common pain-management routine in the NFL had worsened his kidney failure.His life quickly turned into a medical fight:Even after the transplant, he carried the weight of that diagnosis for decades. Easley’s medical battles didn’t stop with the kidney transplant.In 2016, he underwent triple-bypass heart surgery, another major challenge that could have easily knocked him down. But in true Kenny Easley fashion, he bounced back, showing up for Seahawks events, supporting charitable causes, and remaining a powerful voice in the Seattle community.But even then, he stayed private about his health. And that privacy continues today, with his family choosing not to release the cause of death.His death at 66 leaves behind unanswered questions, yes. But it also leaves behind an undeniable legacy, a reminder that greatness doesn’t always last long, but it always lasts loud.","Easley died on november 14, 2025, according to confirmations from the pro football hall of fame and his family.

Former NBA star Patrick Beverley has landed himself in hot water. The Houston Rockets alum generated waves in the NBA world after he was arrested for a felony assault charge in Texas. According to the latest update on Beverley’s felony arrest, the former point guard was charged for assault on a family member or household member impeding breath or circulation, falling under the third-degree felony.According to a post made by Patrick Beverley, he was detained at the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office in Richmond, Texas. The incident has diverted widespread media attention as his little sister, Mya Beverley, lies at the center of the matter. As reported by reputed media outlets, he found his sister with an 18-year-old man in the middle of the night, which got the former NBA star “understandably concerned.” Here is everything you need to know about Patrick Beverley’s little sister, Mya Beverley.Patrick Beverley’s life has always been more than basketball. The Lakers’ alum has always been around his close knit family irrespective of his NBA duties. Amidst all the ups and downs in his life, Patrick’s sister Mya has always been around him. However, little did he know that one day his sister would lead to his arrest based on severe charges.According to a post shared by Patrick a few hours after his arrest, “Please don’t believe everything you see on the internet. Hope all is well, Luv.” The 37-year-old former NBA star’s attorney Letitia Quinones-Hollins, even clarified the entire matter via a statement, which mentioned,“Patrick Beverley has no criminal record. He cares deeply about his little sister—a young lady, a minor.Given that, when he unexpectedly found Mya alone in the home with an 18-year-old man in the middle of the night, he was understandably concerned, as any brother would be about his sister. However, we don’t believe what followed happened the way it’s been described, and we look forward to the opportunity to address that in court. ”Patrick Beverley and Mya are a classic sibling example. He has landed himself in a legal mess. The Los Angeles Lakers alum was booked on third-degree felony charges involving his little sister, Mya Beverley.

Percy Harvin’s Florida home fire brings fast response and raises safety concerns







Percy Harvin, the former NFL wide receiver and Florida Gators star, had a scary moment on Thursday evening when his home in Gainesville, Florida, suddenly caught fire. The flames grew fast, and people living on the same street could see the bright glow from their windows. One neighbor even took a quick video as the fire moved across the roof. Fire trucks reached the home within minutes, and the lights from the trucks filled the whole block. Early updates say everyone is okay, and no serious injuries have been reported.The house is only a short drive from the University of Florida campus, where Percy Harvin became a huge name while playing from 2006 to 2008. Because the fire spread quickly, firefighters and deputies asked people nearby to step out of their homes until things were safe again. Crews worked from different sides of the house to calm the flames. Officials still do not know what started the fire, and the investigation is still active.The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said on Friday morning that deputies and fire rescue teams responded right away after getting the call about the fire on Thursday night.While deputies worked on evacuating nearby residences and obstructing the road, a representative stated Alachua County Fire Rescue managed the flames.Firemen used hoses from various angles to ensure the fire stopped spreading. It is unknown right now whether any family members including Percy Harvin were inside the house when the fire erupted.Because of his college career before becoming the 22nd pick in the 2009 NFL Draft, Percy Harvin, 37, is still really well liked in the Gainesville neighborhood.When they heard the news, several city supporters were anxious but were comforted after discovering no one was severely hurt.Also Read: Is Eminem Performing On NFL Thanksgiving?

What It Means For Indian Workers

What are H1-B visas and who uses them



How are American jobs at risk



Supporters say the programme keeps America competitive



MAGA does not like Trump's U-turn







A heated national row over jobs, immigration and the future of the American workforce has intensified after President Donald Trump suggested that the United States “doesn’t have certain talents” earlier this week, even as the Trump Administation tightens rules around the H1-B visa programme.The GOP leader's latest comments have reignited a long-running political fight over whether foreign workers are helping American innovation or displacing American workers.The H1-B visa allows companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers in specialised fields for up to six years. It is intended for people of “exceptional merit and ability”, typically with at least a bachelor’s degree. The tech sector remains the biggest user of the programme, accounting for up to 70 percent of applications each year. Engineering, consulting, healthcare and university research also rely heavily on the visa.India dominates the applicant pool, making up 73 per cent of all H1-B visa holders, followed by China at 12 per cent, according to Fox News. Universities and non-profit research institutions are exempt from the usual annual cap of 65,000 visas, plus an additional 20,000 for applicants with advanced degrees, which means the total number of approvals is often far higher.Pew Research Center estimates around 400,000 approvals in the last year alone.Opposition to the programme spans both Republicans and Democrats. Critics argue that the system is being abused to import cheaper labour and push aside American workers.In September, Trump issued a presidential proclamation accusing the H1-B system of being “deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labour”. He said this practice “has undermined both our economic and national security”.Trump imposed a $100,000 fee on each new H1-B visa application, effective September 21. His administration is also introducing stricter definitions of “specialty occupation”, expanding compliance inspections, and requiring employers to file applications directly rather than through third-party contractors.Many business leaders warn that harsh restrictions could push talent and investment overseas. The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit to block the new $100,000 fee, arguing it violates immigration law and would make the programme “cost-prohibitive” for small and mid-size companies.Elon Musk is among the most vocal defenders of the visa system, noting that many of the engineers who helped build Tesla and SpaceX first arrived in the United States on H1-B visas. He said, “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.”Despite his own sweeping restrictions, Trump stirred a row this week by insisting that the United States still needed foreign workers because “people have to learn”. He added that “the United States doesn’t have certain talents” and warned that some highly technical defence and technology roles cannot simply be filled by “taking people off an unemployment line”.His remarks have frustrated parts of his MAGA base, who view the comment as undercutting his America First message. Others argue it reveals the core tension at the centre of the H1-B debate: the nation wants to protect American jobs, but it also fears falling behind global competitors like China, which recently launched its own talent visa known as the K visa.",'no talent in u.s.': trump burns maga base for india reset?

""Climate change is a lie""— a person who never opened a science book.

Over 99% of climate scientists globally endorse the reality and human causation of climate change, based on the most comprehensive recent literature reviews. This near-unanimity underscores the urgency for action, as affirmed by bodies like the IPCC and national academies.

I mean even if you think climate change is a hoax, don’t you still care about taking care of the environment?

People are still trying to deny that climate change is real?!

Poorly educated people are put in trump's cabinet in an attempt to make trump seem smart.

Karoline Leavitt stirred a fresh row after claiming that climate change is “based on a fallacy."" Environmental activists were not very happy with White House Press Secretary's comments.Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on Fox News while attacking California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Leavitt accused him of damaging the state with environmental policies she mocked as the “Green New Scam”. She said, “Gavin has done so much damage to his state, with the ‘Green New Scam’ and with this utopian pursuit of climate change that is just so false, it's built on a fallacy, and he's built up energy costs [so much] that people are fleeing the state. ” Her comments run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.Recently, Congress released tens of thousands of Jeffrey Epstein’s emails, which implicated that US President Trump knew about Epstein and the 'underage girls' in the sex trafficker's house. Democratic lawmakers have also advanced a petition to the White House demanding that even more related records be made public.","Leavitt made the remark during an appearance on fox news while attacking california’s democratic governor, gavin newsom.

JD Vance on foreign workers amid H-1B row: 'We don't need low-wage servants',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-on-foreign-workers-amid-h-1b-row-we-dont-need-low-wage-servants/articleshow/125331155.cms,"Vice President JD Vance says America does not need low-wage foreign labors.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers





Vice President JD Vance spoke out on the issue of foreign workers in the US amid the ongoing H-1B row triggered by President Donald Trump's recent statement that US needs 'certain' talents from other countries. As Vance spoke to Sean Hannity, he said the Democrat model was to import more low-wage immigrants which he said hurt the jobs, wages and prosperity.Vance said the choice is between low-wage immigrants and American citizens empowered by technology. The VP said Trump's model is the second one which will pave prosperity for America.As Vance said US should avoid relying on low-wage workers and instead focus on using technology to empower the blue-collar workers, he struck a different chord with the President. Because the president said America lacks certain types of talent and cited the example of the battery plant in Georgia that was raided.“They raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out. They had people from South Korea that made batteries all their lives. You know, making batteries are very complicated. It’s not an easy thing and very dangerous,"" Trump said adding that the South Korean company had “like five or six hundred people, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it.Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. ""You're going to need that,"" Trump said when he was asked whether H-1B visa will be a big priority for his administration.H-1B visa program is for high-skilled individuals, mostly employed in tech and education sectors. But while Trump said US needs foreign workers, Vance said US does not need low-wage foreign workers.“Their (the Democrats) idea was the way that we get more prosperity is that you import more and more low-wage servants and that actually I think reduced prosperity, because it meant that a lot of our blue-collar workers were struggling. But if you use technology and you empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor, I think they are going to do way better, they are going to make higher wages and the whole country is going to be better off,"" Vance said.""In other words, do you depend on low-wage immigrants or do you depend on American citizens bolstered by technology and innovation? That’s the Trump model,"" Vance added.","Vice president jd vance says america does not need low-wage foreign labors.

NCM chairman condemns 'abduction' of Sikh woman in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ncm-chairman-condemns-abduction-of-sikh-woman-in-pakistan/articleshow/125359001.cms,"



CHANDIGARH: Reacting to the incident involving Sarabjit Kaur, a resident of Kapurthala district who was part of a Sikh jatha to Nanakana Sahib and stayed back in Pakistan, National Commission for Minorities Chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura condemned it as “abduction” and an “unforgivable crime. ”He also sought to hold the gurdwara committees and the jatha leader accountable, while urging the Indian government to pressure Pakistan and compel the Pakistani authorities to safely return Sarabjit Kaur. He questioned why the Guru Nanak anniversary could not be celebrated in Sultanpur Lodhi with devotion and challenged those who oppose stopping of jathas.“The kidnapping of Sarabjit Kaur from Kapurthala and the earlier abduction of Kiran Bala from Garhshankar in Pakistan in 2018 are both concerning and raise questions about the security arrangements for Sikh groups. The individuals travelling with these groups are recommended by gurdwara management committees, and the responsibility for their safety lies directly with the jatha leader. Additionally, ensuring the safety of Sikh pilgrims visiting Pakistan and their proper return is the responsibility of the Pakistani government. If women's safety cannot be guaranteed, the purpose of visiting Pakistan is defeated,” he said in a post on his Facebook page.“Guru Nanak Dev Ji spent a significant amount of time in Sultanpur Lodhi. Can the Gurpurab not be celebrated here with devotion? This question compels all Sikh groups, management committees, and government systems to think deeply,” he argued.“Those who oppose the stopping of jathas must also answer why they remain silent when a Sikh woman is left behind. The community will demand answers,” he added.“Was there any conspiratorial alteration in the visas of the women taken to Pakistan with the group, influenced by Pakistan? It is the responsibility of the Pakistani government to clarify this.”Citing a couplet of Guru Gobind Singh, he said, “Today, Singhs return while leaving their women behind, who got caught in love of Turks (Muslims), which is concerning and shameful for the entire community.”","Sarabjit kaur, a resident of kapurthala district, was part of a sikh jatha to nanakana sahib and stayed back in pakistan.

"‘It’s an op, dude’: Bombshell texts reveal how Bannon secretly helped Epstein rehab his image",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-an-op-dude-bombshell-texts-reveal-how-bannon-secretly-helped-epstein-rehab-his-image/articleshow/125358553.cms,"



A lot of names have been released in the Jeffrey Epstein case, and one of them is ""Steve Bannon,"" a former White House chief strategist. The new document revealed text messages between Bannon and Epstein.Texts released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday show that from June 2018 through mid-2019, Steve Bannon, a Maga influencer and convicted sex offender, and Jeffrey Epstein, collaborated on legal and media strategies to shield Epstein from public scrutiny and legal challenges while also promoting Bannon’s rightwing populist agenda. The communications reveal detailed planning of interviews, opinion pieces, film production and crisis communications, Guardian reported.The messages, numbering hundreds over almost a year, emerged as public outrage mounted over Epstein’s criminal history and his connections to powerful figures. In early exchanges from June 2018 Bannon described the scrutiny as “a sophisticated op” and advised Epstein on responses to media outlets, the justice system and his victims.In one unredacted exchange on June 22-2018, Bannon asked Epstein: “Who is running this op on u something serious going on.”Epstein replied: “First a protest at Clinton and then at Trump. Lots of people very angry at our friendship.” Bannon responded: “It’s an op dude – I do this for a living – the pieces that are dropping are deeply researched. This is sophisticated op.”By November the Miami Herald began publishing blockbuster coverage highlighting Epstein’s misdeeds and apparent leniency. In December an unknown correspondent tried to reassure Epstein, writing: “It will all blow over! They’re really just trying to take down Trump and doing whatever they can to do that … !” Epstein replied: “yes thx. its wild. because i am the one able to take him down.”In early February 2019 Bannon linked Epstein to an item on Zero Hedge quoting Republican then senator Ben Sasse. Epstein wrote: “Yes/ wild,” and shared a Fox News item. He then asked for advice: “Continue to ignore? Ann Coulter on hannity/. Attack? Op ed , ? Not my skill set. What about the attunes penning something that suggests indignation and lays out some of the facts.”Bannon advised: “I think makes it way worse.” Epstein asked: “K, what about Ken talking directly to sasse.” Bannon replied: “Won’t help but yes.” Other exchanges reference Ken Starr, Epstein’s 2007 defender and later counsel in the Trump impeachment trial.Later that month Bannon counseled on interviews: “If you do an interview it can’t be like ‘Johnnie does a utube’ – has to be amazingly professional and perfectly cut.” Epstein replied: “woody said he would help edit. not sure how to stage, what points to make. but better than trying to do an interview that i have no experience doing. goal to himanize the monster. anything written carries iittle weight.” Epstein then sought Bannon’s technical advice on format, topics and style.The following day Epstein attacked his victims in a text: “One of the most important facts for the public seems to be the girls used the agreement to get money and only after then tried to have it voided.”By April the pair appeared to plan a film production to “redeem” Epstein’s reputation. On 30 April Epstein wrote: “the christians i met with feel , the media portraying me as beyond redemption is deeply troubling and offensive.” Bannon replied: “Yes yes yes of course – but we must counter ‘rapist who traffics in female children to be raped by worlds most powerful , richest men’ – that can’t be redeemed – that why we let them blow up the argument while showing the 12 you redeemed. Can’t redeem unredeemable – – you are a lot of things – which we will show – but you are NOT that.” He then asked: “Did u get the film we shot ?” Epstein replied: “Just landed.” They discussed filming and crew size, with Bannon advising a “limited crew – 5 max prob 3.” Further texts addressed Epstein’s appearance.In May 2019 Bannon urged Epstein to hire a crisis communications professional. He texted: “Did u hire the crisis comms guy so we can drive the narrative off that great times piece.” Epstein replied: “Hes here with me now. He thinks stick to legal legal legal . A deal is a deal etc. and then a few months from now.” Epstein added: “Decide how to deal with the pervert hermit image and fill the box with another narrative.” Bannon said: “Agree:: how are we ‘sticking to the legal legal legal. ” Epstein wrote: “Articles by legal people . Professors. Lawyers etc. now I’m focused.” Bannon responded: “U had me worried – focus good.”On 28 May Epstein and Bannon criticised Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury. Epstein wrote: “I have now seen some of Wolffs book. Mentions me and underage prostitutes. You as the man behind and in front of the curtain. Lots of Steve quotes. Lots.” Bannon replied: “Ugh – anything awful??? Wish he hadn’t done that – why are u mentioned @ all?” Epstein said: “Palm beach house purchase. . don’t reach out to Michael.” Bannon responded: “Ugh. ” He also reacted “ugh” to a Raw Story link sent by Epstein.On 25 June, weeks before Epstein’s re-arrest, Epstein texted Bannon a Miami Herald headline: “Jeffrey Epstein plea deal must stand, prosecutors tell sex abuse victims.” Bannon responded: “Dude!!!! Is this real Tell me this is real” and “Is that out anywhere yet.” Epstein replied: “Miami herald. But more and better july 9.” Bannon said: “Epic epic epic.” Epstein was re-arrested on 7 July.In other exchanges Epstein commented on unrelated political events. In May he wrote: “Underwater office ? How nuts are these people.” On 3 June, the day of a royal visit to the UK, Epstein texted: “prince andrew and trump today. t000 funny” and “recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago.” Bannon said: “Can’t believe nobody is making u the connective tissue.”The communications also show Epstein advising Bannon in September 2018 on how to undermine allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by focusing on Christine Blasey Ford’s medications. On 30 September 2018 Epstein told Bannon Republicans should “make sure they ask ford about her medications , what type and for how long. . my guess is that katz won’t let her answer”. Bannon replied: “Roger.” Epstein sent links on false memories and added: “she couldn’t recall if the lie detector was given the same day as her mothers funeral or the next day. ? MEDS.” Bannon asked: “Is this a hint” and Epstein said “duh”.Epstein’s correspondent identity is redacted throughout the files, but contextual evidence and an unredacted phone number in one document link the communications to Bannon and match a number cited in a legal case against Trump adviser Roger Stone. Bannon did not respond to requests for comment. When Elon Musk stated earlier this year that “Bannon is in the Epstein files”, Bannon told the Independent he wanted a special investigator to review “all” the Epstein documents.Bannon left the Trump White House in late summer 2017 but maintained influence as a Maga figure. The texts outline how both men coordinated legal defences, shaped public perception and sought to protect Epstein’s reputation while advancing Bannon’s political objectives.","Steve bannon and jeffrey epstein exchanged hundreds of text messages over almost a year.

Hasan Piker reacts to claims and talks about China, Cuba, and IShowSpeed







Hasan Piker, who everyone knows as HasanAbi on Twitch, spoke very openly after many people online said he was “spreading Chinese propaganda.” He talked about this during his livestream on November 14, 2025. The talk started when he read a post from X (Twitter) made on November 13, 2025, by user @joni_askola. The post said that Hasan Piker was “doing Chinese propaganda for a living.” This comment came while Hasan is on a trip to China.Hasan Piker said he does not agree with these claims. He told his viewers that China is a country with good things and bad things, just like any other place, and visiting the country does not mean he is promoting anything.He also said that many foreign affairs people are “not very fond” of him being in China right now. Hasan shared that he finds it strange that people get angry when he goes to China but do not react the same way when he visits other places like Japan. During the stream , Hasan Piker read the full post from @joni_askola and said he did not understand why people think traveling to China means he supports everything the government does. He said he always talks about both sides, the good and the bad, and that he enjoys learning about new cultures and meeting people.He said he feels lucky to be able to visit China and see things with his own eyes. He shared that the food, culture, and people have all been very nice to him. He also said that online critics make travel seem like a crime, which he finds very odd.Hasan Piker compared the reaction to when YouTuber IShowSpeed went to China. He said nobody gave IShowSpeed the same trouble because many of IShowSpeed’s fans are very young and do not stay active on X. Hasan explained that younger fans usually do not argue on social media the same way older audiences do.Hasan then talked about Cuba. He joked that a trip to Cuba would be even worse because he believes he would land in prison afterwards. This came up when a viewer commented that people would react the same way if he went to Cuba.Also Read: Who Is Jack Doherty? Popular YouTuber Arrested In Florida After Officers Report Drug Charges On November 13, 2025, Hasan Piker also joked on stream that he had “become full Chinese,” which made people talk even more online.

In the entire history of the United States, the country has never elected a female president. This year, as nations from Japan to Italy make headlines by elevating women to their highest offices, the US still lags.So, is America ready for a woman in the Oval Office?According to former First Lady Michelle Obama , the answer is no. She said the country is still not prepared for a female president and that the US has “a lot of growing up to do.”“As we saw in this past election, sadly, we ain’t ready,” Obama said. “That’s why I’m like, don’t even look at me about running, because you all are lying. You’re not ready for a woman. You are not.” President Donald Trump defeated former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.Obama made the remarks during a November 5 conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for her podcast. The discussion with actor Tracee Ellis Ross centred on Obama’s new book, “The Look.”Ross had asked Obama if she felt that the first lady role, serving as an archetype for “wifedom and femininity,” had affected “the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president.” “You know, we got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama continued.Obama stumped for Harris on the 2024 campaign trail, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women’s health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris.

Border patrol deployments triggered a wave of arrests in Charlotte on Saturday, with federal agents moving into multiple locations.“We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.Local officials including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticised the operation, saying it “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.” The statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Stephanie Sneed of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg education board, added, “We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives.”Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues had observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday. “Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born US citizen, was on his way to work when he saw agents chasing people. “I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said. Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground. “I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.” He was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.Local organisations responded by holding trainings to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said on Friday that the “vast majority” of those detained in these operations had no criminal convictions, and some were American citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behaviour” they saw and notify local law enforcement about it.The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasised ahead of time that it was not involved in federal immigration enforcement.","Border patrol deployments triggered a wave of arrests in charlotte on saturday, with federal agents moving into multiple locations.

Thousands of people marched through the streets of Mexico City on Saturday to protest against drug violence and the security policies of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s government. The demonstration was organised on social media by representatives of “Generation Z,” though AFP saw protesters of various ages.Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced criticism of her security policy due to several high-profile murders, mainly in the state of Michoacan. Banners with messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” were displayed alongside the pirate flag emblematic of the Japanese manga “One Piece,” which has become a symbol of global youth protest, AFP reported.Protesters gathered in front of the National Palace in Mexico City, where Sheinbaum lives and works, and knocked down some of the metal fences protecting the building.Police guarding the compound used tear gas grenades and fire extinguishers to contain the protesters, who were banging on the fences. “This is how you should have protected Carlos Manzo,” some of the protesters shouted at the security forces.Hundreds of young people threw projectiles at the police, who responded by deploying their shields and also threw objects at the protesters.Carlos Manzo was the mayor of Uruapan in Michoacan who was assassinated on November 1. He had led a crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his town. Several of those attending the march, which wound its way through major avenues in the centre of the capital, wore hats resembling Manzo. The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the protests on Saturday.Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning press conference that the protest call was “inorganic” and “paid for.” “It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” the President said.LARGE Straw Hat Pirates’ Jolly Roger, which was seen in protests from Indonesia to Nepal, was also spotted. In the video, graffiti appears outside Mexico City’s National Palace.The flag comes from the wildly popular 1997 Japanese manga One Piece by Eciichiro Oda, One Piece, which has become a global symbol for youth-led protest movements, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines, as seen in large protests during 2025.Protesters use the flag, which depicts a skull wearing a straw hat with a crossbones, to symbolize resistance against corruption, government overreach,In Asia, the flag gained popularity as a tool of political expression and defiance during protests in Indonesia, the Philippines and Nepal, and has also popped up on the streets of Paris.","Thousands of people marched through the streets of mexico city on saturday to protest against drug violence and the security policies of president claudia sheinbaum’s government.
