Leaders agree to designate new high commissioners



Relations soured over Nijjar killing



NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada. The two leaders also agreed to appoint new high commissioners for both countries to help resume ""regular services"" for citizens and businesses.PM Modi praised Carney for hosting the G7 Summit and said India is looking forward to working closely with Canada to improve ties. He noted the common values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law that India and Canada share.""Had an excellent meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney. Complimented him and the Canadian Government for successfully hosting the G7 Summit. India and Canada are connected by a strong belief in democracy, freedom and rule of law. PM Carney and I look forward to working closely to add momentum to the India-Canada friendship. Areas like trade, energy, space, clean energy, critical minerals, fertilisers and more offer immense potential in this regard,"" PM Modi posted on X.India and Canada have also agreed to designate new high commissioners, with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries.A statement from the Canadian Prime Minister’s Office said Carney and PM Modi agreed on the need to strengthen ties based on mutual respect, rule of law, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.""The leaders agreed to designate new high commissioners, with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries,"" the statement said.PM Modi also thanked Carney for inviting India to the G7 Summit. ""I am very grateful to you for inviting India to G7 and I am also fortunate that I have got this opportunity to visit Canada once again after 2015 and connect with the people of Canada,"" he said.He also spoke about the strong economic links between the two countries. Canadian companies have invested in India, and Indian businesses have also made a mark in Canada.PM Modi said, ""India and Canada relations are very important in many ways. Many Canadian companies have investments in India. The people of India also have a huge investment on Canadian soil. Dedicated to democratic values, Canada and India will have to strengthen democracy together, will have to strengthen humanity...""""This is the first time I have got the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister after his election, so I congratulate him for his grand victory in this election and in the coming period, India and Canada will progress together in many areas with him,"" he added.Ties between the two countries had worsened after the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023. In October last year, India withdrew its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Canada linked them to the Nijjar case. India also expelled Canadian diplomats.India had said the Justin Trudeau government was letting pro-Khalistani groups operate from Canada. Carney became prime minister in March this year after Trudeau stepped down. He is an economist and entered politics recently.After Trudeau’s exit, India hoped to rebuild relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity."" In recent months, security officials from both countries resumed contact. There have also been talks about appointing new high commissioners.The ministry of external affairs said last week that India sees the upcoming meeting between PM Modi and Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit as a chance to exchange views and “explore pathways” to reset ties.During PM Modi’s previous visit to Canada in 2015, the two countries upgraded their relationship to a strategic partnership. Canada has a large Indian diaspora.About 4.5 per cent of Canada’s population is of Indian origin, including around 1.8 million people of Indian descent. The Sikh population is around 770,000. Additionally, nearly 1 million Non-Resident Indians (NRI) live in Canada as students, skilled professionals, or temporary workers.Indian students have been the largest group of international students in Canada. In 2022, they made up 41 per cent of the international student population. However, Canada’s recent immigration policies have affected both Indian students’ prospects and the finances of Canadian universities.","Pm modi praised carney for hosting the g7 summit and said india is looking forward to working closely with canada to improve ties.

Colorado Avalanche still strongly in the mix



Jonathan Toews is expected to decide soon as negotiations begin.







Jonathan Toews is inching closer to a highly anticipated NHL comeback. Once eyed by four teams, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Tampa Bay Lightning, he has reportedly cut his list in half. Now, all eyes are on two Western Conference teams, the Winnipeg Jets and Colorado Avalanche, as Toews prepares to negotiate a deal.Toews returning to his hometown is more than just a feel-good narrative; it’s now a serious possibility. For Winnipeg, bringing in Toews would not only boost leadership and experience but also serve as a powerful symbol for the franchise. With the team looking to re-establish itself as a strong postseason contender, Toews could be the missing piece that stabilizes the locker room and adds playoff grit.While the Jets offer sentiment and hometown appeal, the Colorado Avalanche bring title ambitions. Despite earlier assumptions that the Avalanche had moved on after acquiring Brock Nelson, Dreger clarified that his Colorado sources insisted they remain very, very interested in Toews. The front office views him as a cultural fit who can strengthen their leadership group.The Avalanche are still hunting another deep playoff run, and a healthy Toews could add the veteran savvy they lacked last season.With uncertainty around their bottom six and leadership depth, Toews’ return could round out their roster.Toews’ comeback story has moved from speculation to strategy. With a decision reportedly between just two teams, negotiations are expected to begin in earnest. The timing suggests he wants a deal wrapped up before the July 1 free agency window, allowing him to integrate into his new team early.Read more: Who is Quinn Hughes girlfriend?

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 53-year-old cabinet member was transported by ambulance out of precaution and is now alert and recovering, a DHS spokesperson confirmed. “Secretary Noem had an allergic reaction today. She was transported to the hospital out of an abundance of caution. She is alert and recovering,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Noem was admitted to the emergency room, where CNN reporters observed several Secret Service agents positioned at multiple entrances.Appointed to lead the department shortly after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term, Noem was confirmed by the Senate in late January. Her appointment followed a career as South Dakota’s governor and representative in Congress.Since taking over the DHS, she has become a key figure in enforcing Trump’s renewed focus on strict immigration controls. Under her leadership, the department has overseen troop deployments to the southern border and the use of emergency powers to facilitate mass deportations of undocumented migrants.In addition to overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem also manages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), though she has recently called for the agency to be dismantled. She has repeatedly criticised FEMA as ineffective and unnecessary. Last week, Trump also stated his intention to phase out FEMA following the end of this year’s hurricane season.As news of her hospitalisation spread, messages of support poured in online.Bruce LeVell, former Executive Director of President Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, posted on X, “My dear friend @Sec_Noem, our fearless Secretary of Homeland Security, was just rushed to the hospital. My heart is with her during this challenging time, but I know her strength and determination will shine through. Please join me in keeping Kristi in your prayers for a swift and full recovery.“She has been tirelessly spearheading @realDonaldTrump initiative to uphold law and order and utilise ICE to keep our country safe from criminals.

Why Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner needs a clean NHL break



A Blizzard of Goals Puts Florida a Win Away From Glory | 32 Thoughts

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey. Mitch Marner wants control over his next chapter, and that next chapter seems destined to begin far from Toronto, in the quieter lanes of the NHL’s Western frontier. Don’t be surprised if talks stretch deep into the summer. Marner’s $10.9 million cap hit means any deal will require strategic balancing from both sides.In the meantime, fan opinion remains divided. Some still believe Marner deserves more time, while others see his exit as a necessary evolution for the franchise. Mitch Marner’s future with the Maple Leafs seems increasingly uncertain as trade rumors intensify. A move to the Western Conference could offer the reset he’s reportedly seeking. With emotional fatigue setting in and pressure mounting, Marner’s next chapter may unfold far from Toronto’s spotlight.","Toronto maple leafs forward mitch marner is reportedly looking for a clean break.

Zack Cozart delivers strong message: He won’t back Trump if U.S. chooses war path







As global tensions escalate in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, the political discourse in the United States is starting to reflect the unease. One unexpected voice has emerged from the sports world, signaling a strong personal stance—former MLB All-Star Zack Cozart has publicly warned that his support for Donald Trump could vanish if the president initiates a new war.Zack Cozart, who earned All-Star honors in 2017 and was once a vocal backer of Trump, used his platform on social media to issue a clear message. “If Trump gets us in a war, I will no longer support him, and I’m sure most of you know I love Trump,” he declared in a candid post on X. The statement marks a notable shift from his previous support, which had been emphatic and unwavering.Just last year, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Cozart made no effort to hide his excitement. “I dunno bout yall but I can’t wait to vote for Trump… I’ve honestly never seen the party as united as now… they tried to kill our President … least we can do is VOTE!!” he wrote, reflecting his deep alignment with the Republican cause.But with President Trump closely monitoring the brewing Middle East conflict, the stakes have changed. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, acknowledged on Monday that Trump left the G7 summit early to “attend to many important matters,” citing ongoing developments in the region.The situation has become increasingly volatile, prompting Trump to make bold declarations. He urged citizens to evacuate Tehran and stated, “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate,” while emphasizing the need for “a real end, not a ceasefire.” This hardline posture may be driving even staunch supporters like Cozart to reconsider their allegiance.Cozart didn’t stop with one post. He later shared another message, hinting at a sense of disillusionment among Republican voters. The tone suggested frustration over what some perceive as misplaced priorities—foreign entanglements over domestic issues.For a figure once so invested in Trump’s political journey, Cozart’s statement feels like more than just a fleeting opinion—it reflects a deeper concern over the consequences of military action. While war is far from certain, it’s clear that even loyal followers are prepared to speak out if they believe the country’s direction veers off course.Also Read: Bryan Reynolds rushes out of Pirates-Tigers game as his wife goes into labor mid-match","Former mlb star vows to cut support for trump if u.s. enters war.

On Day 2 of the G7 summit in Kananaskis on Tuesday, the remaining leaders continued with key discussions on terrorism, human smuggling, and the war in Ukraine, after Trump exited Monday night, saying he needed to focus on rising tensions between Iran and Israel.Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Outreach Session and held several bilateral meetings. G7 members issued strong joint statements on migrant smuggling and transnational repression, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for more global support amid fresh Russian attacks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called his discussions with G7 leaders “productive”, saying they focused on global challenges and hopes for a better world.He held meetings with Canadian PM Mark Carney, UK PM Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, and Australian PM Anthony Albanese. They spoke about strengthening trade ties and boosting cooperation in economic matters.India and Canada also agreed to appoint new high commissioners to normalise consular and trade services, after a period of diplomatic strain.At the G7 Outreach Session, Modi repeated India’s firm stand against terrorism. He urged world leaders to act strictly against those who support or promote it. He also raised concerns of the Global South, asking the G7 to address them more seriously.The G7 countries released a joint statement renewing their pledge to stop migrant smuggling. This comes under the G7 Coalition and their 2024 Action Plan.The leaders committed to stronger border management and targeting criminal networks involved in human smuggling and trafficking. They also noted links between smuggling and other crimes like money laundering and drug trafficking, calling it a threat to public safety.The G7 also took a joint stand against transnational repression—acts by foreign states to threaten or silence people living abroad.Calling it a growing threat, the statement described it as an attack on sovereignty, national security, and human rights. It said such actions often target journalists, dissidents, activists, and religious minorities, especially those in diaspora communities.The leaders agreed to coordinate efforts to stop this trend and uphold international law.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined the second day of the summit as Russia launched one of its biggest attacks since the war began—killing 15 people and injuring more than 150.“It was a very difficult night,” Zelenskyy told leaders. He asked for continued military and diplomatic support, and said Ukraine is ready for peace talks, but only if pressure is applied on Russia for an unconditional ceasefire.Canadian PM Carney said the attack “underscores the importance of standing in total solidarity with Ukraine”.French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will host the next G7 summit in June 2026. The meeting will take place in the Alpine spa town of Évian-les-Bains. Macron said the focus would be on maintaining unity among G7 nations and working closely with trusted partners to increase their influence on global issues.",Prime minister narendra modi addressed the outreach session and held several bilateral meetings.

She graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1996, later refining her skills in Italy at the Italian Culinary Institute for Foreigners. There, she completed apprenticeships and fell in love with Italian culinary traditions.On her return to New York City, she worked in some of the city’s top kitchens, including Felidia under Lidia Bastianich and Savoy in SoHo, focusing on Mediterranean cuisine. In the early 2000s, she shifted to teaching at the Institute of Culinary Education before stepping into television.Audiences were introduced to her on Iron Chef America, where she appeared as a sous chef. Her charisma and cooking ability earned her a solo role with Secrets of a Restaurant Chef, which debuted in 2008 and ran for nine seasons. The show earned her an Emmy nomination.Outside of television, Burrell authored two cookbooks. Her 2011 release Cook Like a Rock Star became a New York Times bestseller, and she followed it up with Own Your Kitchen: Recipes to Inspire and Empower.Burrell was also committed to giving back. She served on the advisory board of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, worked as a celebrity ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, and was a dedicated member of City Harvest’s Food Council.Burrell is survived by her husband, Stuart Claxton, his son Javier, her mother Marlene, her sister Jane, her children Isabella, Amelia and Nicolas, and her brother Ben.","Anne burrell was a familiar face on the food network and was best known as the long-time host of worst cooks in america.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran.

Israel-Iran war: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-donald-trump-may-consider-joining-israel-in-striking-nuclear-sites-report-claims-growing-us-involvement/articleshow/121918496.cms,"



US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","Us president donald trump is weighing the possibility of us involvement in israel’s ongoing strikes on iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told cbs news.

The New York Times

Who is Alex Soros?



Alex Soros, 39, is the chairman of the Open Society Foundations, the global philanthropic organization founded by his father, billionaire investor George Soros.

Raised in New York, Alex graduated from New York University in 2009 and earned a PhD in history from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2018.

In June 2023, he was named the heir to his father’s fortune and took over leadership of OSF and Soros Fund Management.

Who is Huma Abedin?



Huma Abedin, 48, is a longtime political aide and trusted confidante of Hillary Clinton.

Often called Clinton’s “second daughter,” she worked closely with her in various roles — from the White House to the US Senate and the State Department.

Born in Michigan to an Indian father and Pakistani mother, Abedin was raised in Saudi Arabia. She often credits her multicultural background for shaping her identity and perspective.

She started her political journey at 19, interning in the First Lady’s office in 1996, and steadily rose through the ranks to become one of Clinton’s most trusted aides.

Over the years, she held several prominent positions: senior advisor to Senator Clinton, traveling chief of staff during the 2008 presidential campaign, deputy chief of staff at the US State Department, and ultimately vice chair of Hillary for America in 2016.

Her final role with Clinton was as chief of staff. Though known for keeping a low profile, Abedin’s personal life has drawn attention.

She married former Congressman Anthony Weiner in 2010, but their relationship unraveled after multiple sexting scandals, The People reported. The couple separated in 2016 and divorced in 2017. They share a son, Jordan Zain Weiner, born in 2011.

She briefly dated actor Bradley Cooper before meeting Alex Soros at a mutual friend’s birthday party in 2023.

The two got engaged in May 2024 and recently married in a high-profile wedding attended by political heavyweights and celebrities alike.

'They are guilty as sin': Elon Musk slams media companies; dares both 'to take drug tests & publish' after he tests negative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-are-guilty-as-sin-elon-musk-slams-media-companies-dares-both-to-take-drug-tests-publish-after-he-tests-negative/articleshow/121914382.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday hit back at media companies, posting his own negative drug test results and challenging “The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to take tests and publish the results. ”Musk posted a photo of his lab test results on X with a simple caption “lol,” showing negative results for several substances including ketamine, cocaine, and amphetamines. The post came just weeks after a New York Times bombshell report, which alleged that Musk had used a “cocktail” of substances while serving in a government advisory role.Responding to a repost, Musk doubled down, writing: “New York Times lies as easy as breathing. It’s normal for them.”In a separate post, he threw down a public challenge: “Great idea. I hereby challenge the NYT and WSJ to take drug tests and publish the results!”“They won’t, because those hypocrites are guilty as sin,” he sharply added.Musk also accused WSJ of falsely reporting that Tesla’s board was seeking a new CEO, calling it another example of unreliable journalism.Musk has tested negative for fentanyl, ketamine, and more than 22 other substances, including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, ecstasy, opioids, cannabis, cocaine, and ketamine, according to lab results he shared.The screening was conducted at Fastest Labs of South Austin, Texas on June 11, according to the shared documentation.Musk had previously acknowledged receiving ketamine prescriptions for depression treatment.The results follow intense media scrutiny and a bombshell New York Times report that claimed Musk was regularly using ketamine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and kept a daily pillbox with around 20 different drugs, including Adderall.The report even alleged the ketamine use had started affecting his bladder.He also reposted a user who quipped, “If Elon is on any drugs, I want what he’s having,” and later shared his test results with a single-word caption: “lol.”Musk had earlier dismissed these claims, saying, ""I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this is not even news,"" he posted. ""It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then,"" he added.The controversy came to a head recently when US President Donald Trump called Musk a “big-time drug addict.”Earlier, in his final Oval Office press conference last month, Musk appeared with a black eye, which he said was caused by his 5-year-old son—and brushed off drug-related questions, telling reporters to “Move on!”","Tesla ceo elon musk posted his own negative drug test results on tuesday.

Iran-Israel conflict: How will blocking of Strait of Hormuz hit India?

Israel Strikes Iranian Foreign Ministry Building; ‘IDF Missiles Hit Nuclear, Govt, & Energy Targets’

What is the Strait of Hormuz & why it matters

The Strait of Hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation. This strategic waterway, spanning just 29 nautical miles at its narrowest section, facilitates the movement of approximately one-third of maritime oil shipments and 20% of global liquefied natural gas.

The strategic significance of this passageway, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Sea, is emphasised by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which designates it as the ""world's most important oil chokepoint.""

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that in 2023, roughly 20 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil and refined products traversed the Strait of Hormuz, accounting for about 30% of global oil commerce.

The majority of this volume—approximately 70%—was destined for Asian markets, with China, India and Japan being the primary destinations.

Although alternative pipeline networks are present, their capacity remains restricted.

According to IEA calculations, merely 4.2 mb/d of crude oil can be redirected through land-based routes, including Saudi Arabia's East-West pipeline to the Red Sea and the UAE's Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline to Fujairah. This available capacity constitutes just about one-fourth of the regular daily volume passing through the Strait.

Impact on India

Will the escalating Iran-Israel conflict cause an oil supply issue for India? Indian refiners are exploring alternative energy sources, including those from West African nations, to ensure fuel supply security in case Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz amid escalating tensions with Israel, according to oil industry officials.Following the eruption of Iran-Israel tensions on Friday, senior oil ministry officials and industry leaders are conducting scenario analyses and preparing contingency plans for potential supply disruptions and price volatility.The oil ministry reports that India maintains crude oil and petroleum product storage facilities capable of meeting 74 days of domestic consumption requirements. The strategic petroleum reserves account for 9.5 days of this total capacity.Unlike its strategic crude reserves, India has not established gas storage facilities. Additionally, the government maintains confidentiality regarding national oil and gas inventory levels.Industry executives indicate that this overall storage capability includes stocks at refineries, pipeline networks, vessels in transit, product storage terminals, and vacant tanks suitable for storing both crude oil and refined products.A potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could impact 40% of India's crude imports and 54% of its LNG supplies. This strait currently facilitates approximately 30% of global oil trade and 20% of LNG shipments.India's crude oil dependency on imports stands at 90%, with refineries heavily dependent on Gulf supplies. Russian imports constitute approximately 35%, Gulf nations contribute over 40%, whilst Africa, the US and other sources make up the balance. African imports declined to 5% in May from 12% in April.For 2024, India's LNG procurement from the Gulf region stands at 54%, with Qatar providing 80% and UAE supplying the remaining amount. Qatar, ranking amongst the top three global LNG exporters, maintains significant influence over worldwide gas supply. Any interruption to Qatari exports could trigger a surge in spot LNG prices.Also Read | Significant dent? How an escalating Iran-Israel conflict can threaten India’s growth story - explained Additionally, long-term LNG prices could increase, considering 60% of India's long-term agreements are connected to crude oil rates.However, industry executives from Indian refining and gas companies express scepticism about Iran implementing a blockade, based on historical precedents. They suggest that such an action would likely trigger substantial price increases and direct US intervention, whilst also adversely affecting Gulf nations and oil-dependent countries.Additionally, executives note that blocking the strait would disrupt both Gulf exports and essential imports, including Iran's own trade, which serves as a significant deterrent.Currently, Indian refiners are maintaining their normal purchasing patterns without resorting to 'panic buying'.Also Read | Iran-Israel conflict impact: Basmati rice prices to drop as exports to Iran, third largest buyer of Indian basmati, expected to decline While contingency plans exist, an executive told ET that ""closure of the strait would shrink the global pool of available oil and gas. No matter how carefully you prepare, every economy would feel the impact of a supply crunch and price spike."" Another executive highlighted the situation's intricacy, stating, ""If India turns to West Africa for additional supplies, other importers are likely to follow.""The international LNG trade lacks the maturity and flexibility seen in oil markets, with few options for supply diversification. The 2022 energy crisis highlighted this vulnerability when a former Gazprom subsidiary defaulted on its LNG delivery commitments to India's GAIL, compelling the company to reduce supplies to domestic consumers.","The strait of hormuz serves as a crucial channel for worldwide energy transportation.

In an unexpected moment of political choreography, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was seen crouching on the floor to retrieve documents spilled by US President Donald Trump during a joint announcement of a new UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada.The two leaders had just declared the official signing of the much-anticipated trade agreement when Trump opened his folder for the cameras, only to send several papers fluttering to the ground.“Oops, sorry about that,” Trump said with a chuckle, while Starmer quickly bent down, adding, “It’s a very important document.”Starmer later told reporters that he acted instinctively, knowing that if anyone else moved forward, they might be tackled by Trump’s security team. “There weren’t many choices,” he said, half-jokingly. “I was just deeply conscious that it wouldn’t have been good for anybody else to have stepped forward.”Trump, in classic form, then mistakenly announced the deal as one with the European Union instead of the UK. “It’s a fair deal for both. It’ll produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income,” he said, apparently unfazed.Starmer clarified the agreement would affect tariffs on cars and aerospace, calling it “a sign of strength” in UK-US relations.“Donald, thank you very much.

In late May 2025, Qatar Airways made the strategic decision to cancel its order for 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s, a move confirmed by CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer in an interview with Bloomberg. a move that not only ends its short-lived venture into the type but also reshapes the airline’s entire narrowbody strategy. The order, which also included options for 25 more, was placed during the 2022 Farnborough Airshow, a time when the airline’s relationship with Airbus was at an all-time low, the deal was positioned as a solution for the airline’s regional network, with Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ then-CEO Stan Deal praising the aircraft as ""ideally suited for Qatar Airways' regional network.""But two years later, delays in the 737 MAX 10’s certification, which has pushed its expected entry into commercial service to 2026 at the earliest, have forced the airline to reconsider. Qatar Airways is not alone in facing these setbacks, major carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines are also waiting, with growing frustration.In fact, United’s Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Nocella, told Reuters that the 737 MAX 10 isn’t expected to arrive before 2027 or even 2028, and the airline is now hesitant to convert any MAX 9 orders into MAX 10s.“We want to see the aircraft certified before we make the firm commitment,” Nocella said.Qatar Airways, meanwhile, opted to walk away entirely.Qatar’s move to order the 737 MAX 10s in 2022 wasn’t born purely of performance metrics, it was a response to an escalating legal and commercial dispute with Airbus. That year, Qatar Airways grounded all 29 of its Airbus A350s, citing what it described as ""accelerated surface degradation"" of the aircraft’s painted fuselage.In response, the airline filed a lawsuit seeking $600 million in damages from Airbus and publicly challenged the safety and airworthiness of the A350 fleet. Airbus, while acknowledging cosmetic and surface issues, insisted the aircraft were structurally safe and continued deliveries to other customers.During this high-profile conflict:At the peak of the fallout, the Boeing 737 MAX 10 was pulled in to fill that gap, offering Qatar Airways an alternative narrowbody solution as it severed ties, temporarily, with Airbus.But in early 2023, the feud reached a resolution. Both parties issued a joint statement announcing that the matter had been settled amicably:""Qatar Airways and Airbus are pleased to have reached an amicable and mutually agreeable settlement in relation to their legal dispute over A350 surface degradation and the grounding of A350 aircraft. A repair project is now underway and both parties look forward to getting these aircraft safely back in the air.""Following this, Qatar reinstated the order for 50 A321neos, and Airbus resumed delivery plans for the grounded A350s. The settlement not only restored fleet development plans but reset the tone of the Qatar-Airbus relationship.Qatar Airways’ Chief Executive Officer Badr Mohammed Al Meer, in an interview with, confirmed the airline had dropped the MAX 10 order, which also included options for 25 more aircraft. This decision, he revealed, was made in conjunction with a massive new Boeing widebody order that dwarfs the value of the narrowbody deal.Earlier this month, Qatar Airways placed its largest-ever aircraft order, agreeing to purchase 130 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 777-9s, with options for an additional 50 aircraft, a potential total of 210 widebodies valued at $96 billion.Responding to whether the airline was playing Boeing and Airbus against each other, Al Meer toldFrancine Lacqua:“You know, for the time being, we need to focus on finalizing our agreement with Boeing. As you saw, we are not like other airlines where we split our orders 20 today, 20 next year. Because we are basing our order on a very solid strategy and we decided to go with the 210 aircraft order. However, it doesn’t mean that Airbus is out of the game. Our narrowbodies will continue to be Airbus.”In a separate public comment, Al Meer reiterated the airline’s direction:“Our narrowbody [fleet] will continue to be Airbus. We are receiving 50 A321neos starting next year. So our whole narrowbody fleet will be basically operated by Airbus. We continue to receive A350-1000s, and there will always be a chance for another order from Airbus.”As of now, Qatar Airways operates a limited narrowbody fleet consisting of:Several MAX 8s previously operated by Qatar Airways have already been leased to IndiGo for routes between Qatar and India. The remaining three are expected to be phased out soon, aligning with the airline’s plan to standardize its narrowbody fleet around Airbus.Qatar Airways is already the largest operator of the Airbus A350-1000 globally. The aircraft typically features two configurations:In the years ahead, the airline will boast one of the most modern widebody fleets in the world, operating from its hub at Doha Hamad International Airport (DOH).While Boeing has secured a record-breaking widebody order, there’s speculation that Qatar Airways may also return to Airbus for additional widebodies. Possibilities include:Qatar Airways' renewed ties with Airbus open the door for future deals, as the airline looks to refine and expand its fleet under a disciplined, long-term strategy. The airline is clearly not chasing diversification for its own sake, it's targeting operational efficiency, flexibility, and strategic alignment with its growth ambitions.As for Boeing, with a growing backlog of 737 MAX 10 orders, the manufacturer now faces intensifying pressure to resolve regulatory hurdles that have kept the aircraft grounded in the certification process. The delays are prompting several major carriers to reconsider their long-term fleet strategies. Qatar Airways is not alone in stepping back from the MAX 10; United Airlines, one of the aircraft’s largest customers, has expressed deep concerns over delivery timelines. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Alaska Airlines, all with MAX 10 orders in the pipeline, are also closely watching the certification timeline, with some reportedly exploring alternative options or reconfiguring existing commitments.","Qatar airways cancelled its remaining order for 23 airbus a350s. The airline also cancelled a separate order for 50 airbus a321neos. In late may 2025, qatar airways made the strategic decision to cancel its order for 25 boeing 737 max 10s. Qatar airways' chief executive officer badr mohammed al meer confirmed the airline had dropped the max 10 order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121906863,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-666237,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Plane shortage and snags: Air India cancels nine long hauls today, mostly Dreamliners",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plane-shortage-and-snags-air-india-cancels-nine-long-hauls-today-mostly-on-dreamliners/articleshow/121913086.cms,"NEW DELHI: Air India on Tuesday cancelled at least eight international flights to be operated on Boeing 787 Dreamliner and one on a B777. The B787 cancellations were for: Ahmedabad-London Gatwick; Gatwick-Amritsar; Delhi to Vienna, Paris and Dubai; Bangalore-London & return and Paris-Delhi.A Boeing 777 (not a Dreamliner) operating San Francisco (SFO)-Kolkata (where it takes a fuelling halt)-Mumbai on Tuesday was found to have a technical issue in Kolkata and was grounded there. As a result, the Mumbai-SFO it was to operate was cancelled. Similarly, for the Dreamliners, the return sectors were impacted too, except Vienna, where a B787 was parked to operate to Delhi.After the Ahmedabad crash, AI now has 33 Dreamliners, of which four are under major maintenance. About 24 of the 29 B787s have undergone the DGCA-ordained one-time checks. What has further compounded matters for AI is the even longer routes to and from the west after the Israel-Iran war, as Iran's airspace has been closed along with others like Jordan. That has increased flying time by about an hour. Also, this means pilots and cabin crew have to fly longer due to which AI has sought relaxation from DGCA to make them work longer than the stipulated norms set for safety to ensure the crew is not fatigued.As and when the DGCA withdraws this crew time duty limitation, which stressed pilots are now hoping for, crew shortage will add to the problem.So AI now has fewer Dreamliners (which are operated to Europe/UK/Far East and Australia). Also, the airline has majorly expanded routes in about last two years while new aircraft induction has been slower than expected due to global supply chain issues. As a result, the airline has stretched itself thin that affects on time performance as there’s hardly any buffer if an aircraft — with the old ones having a lower than optimal technical despatch reliability — has to be grounded for technical reason.Meanwhile about Tuesday’ cancellations, AI said: “AI159 from Ahmedabad to Gatwick (which used to be AI 171 earlier) cancelled due to unavailability of aircraft, resulting from airspace restrictions and additional precautionary checks, leading to longer than usual turnaround of aircraft. Consequently, flight AI170 from London Gatwick to Amritsar of June 17 stands cancelled.”“AI143 from Delhi to Paris of June 17 cancelled. Mandatory pre-flight checks identified an issue which is being presently addressed. However, in view of the flight coming under the restrictions on night operations at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport, the said flight has been cancelled. Consequently, flight AI142 from Paris to Delhi on June 18, 2025 also stands cancelled,” AI said in a statement.While Delhi-Vienna was canceled Tuesday, there was a Dreamliner in the Austrian capital which is expected to operate the flight to Delhi on Tuesday. So the return lag was not cancelled. AI is making “alternative arrangements to fly (passengers) to their destination at the earliest. We are providing hotel accommodation and also offering full refunds on cancellations or complimentary rescheduling if opted by the passengers. ”","Air india on tuesday cancelled at least eight international flights to be operated on boeing 787 dreamliner and one on a b777. The b787 cancellations were for: ahmedabad-london gatwick; gatwick-amritsar; delhi to vienna, paris and dubai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121913158,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-338342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
