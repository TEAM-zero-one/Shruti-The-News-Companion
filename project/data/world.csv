Judiciary must not create anti-investment climate: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judiciary-must-not-create-anti-investment-climate-sc/articleshow/128870481.cms,"(AI image)

Regulations must sync with other countries, says SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said constitutional courts must be careful in exercising judicial review of laws so as not to create an anti-investment atmosphere and should weigh national interest against hypothetical fears about legislation.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi made these oral observations on Friday during preliminary hearing on a PIL by E A S Sarma, whose counsel Prashant Bhushan faulted the liability fastened on private players operating nuclear power plants under the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancing of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act passed by Parliament in Dec. Bhushan said the private players' liability is capped at 3,000 crore even though a nuclear plant accident could cause damage running into lakhs of crores of rupees and cited the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters. The govt has allowed private players in the nuclear sector but absolves them of strict civil liability clauses, he said, adding that the govt's liability is also capped at 4,500 crore.CJI Kant said, ""There must be an atmosphere in the country where investors feel encouraged to invest.""CJI Kant said, ""Today, coal-based power plants are not encouraged. We cannot do without nuclear energy. So, there must be a balance in the approach - national interest vs hypothetical fears.""""We should not create an atmosphere where people will fear to invest in India because courts here interfere in everything. The litigation drags on and the projects become unviable despite huge investments.""Justice Bagchi said, ""These are policy decisions - what should be our energy basket. Whether the policy suffers bias or is unconstitutional could be determined on scrutiny.""""Show us the regulatory framework on civil liability in countries like the USA, Europe and Japan. When electricity is traded across borders, the regulatory framework in India must be compatible with those in other countries,"" he said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal attempted to interject in support of Bhushan, but the bench stopped him saying ""let Bhushan assist us."" The bench asked Bhushan to give details of the regulatory framework on civil nuclear liability regimes in other countries and adjourned the hearing to next month.","Cji surya kant said, ""there must be an atmosphere in the country where investors feel encouraged to invest"" the bench asked bhushan to give details of the regulatory framework on civil nuclear liability regimes in other countries.

India closely monitoring Af-Pak escalation; backs Taliban but wary of full-blown conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amidst-afghanistan-pakistan-escalation-india-keeps-a-close-watch/articleshow/128869368.cms,"India was closely monitoring the situation as Afghanistan and Pakistan seemed poised for a dangerous escalation, with Islamabad declaring that the two countries were in an “open war” following Pakistan’s airstrikes on “terrorist hideouts” in Afghanistan and the latter’s retaliatory action. Unconfirmed reports said that senior Taliban leaders were killed in Pakistan’s latest air assaults on Kabul but the Indian side could not independently verify such claims.The relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan has unravelled dramatically in the past few years, after the initial euphoria in Islamabad over the return of the Taliban in 2021. Pakistan has blamed Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) or Pakistan Taliban for terrorist attacks on its soil and on several occasions launched targeted strikes against TTP or its splinter groups’ alleged hideouts in Afghanistan. According to Islamabad, Baloch insurgents also find sanctuary in Afghanistan. Kabul has mostly responded with what it calls necessary and measured military action.On this occasion though, Pakistan has directly targeted the not just terrorist infrastructure but also Afghanistan military facilities in Kabul and other cities. What happens next, and if there’s a full-blown war or not, will likely depend on whether the Taliban are prepared to go further up the ladder of escalation.India’s own ties with the Taliban have seen a stunning turnaround during this period, initially on the back of its large-scale humanitarian assistance to Kabul and now the commitment to fulfil the development needs of the Afghan people, circumventing the lack of international recognition for the regime. India’s response so far to the Pakistan-Afghanistan crisis so far has been a manifestation of this new reality that Islamabad must contend with.India has continued to maintain that Pakistan’s cross-border adventurism resulting in civilian casualties is nothing but a ploy to deflect attention from its domestic failures. The Indian government called Pakistan’s airstrikes earlier this week an attempt to externalise its internal failures. India also strongly backs Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. The Taliban reciprocated suitably to these gestures as they endorsed, much to Pakistan’s chagrin, a mention of J&K as a part of India in a joint statement issued after Afghanistan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s unprecedented visit to India last year in October. The Taliban have also dismissed Islamabad’s claims that India is using Afghanistan and its alleged links with the TTP to target Pakistan.However, while an antagonistic relationship between the two countries allays fears about Pakistan’s longstanding policy of using Afghanistan for strategic depth, a major military escalation that would imperil regional stability is more than what India would bargain for. In fact, it would come at the least opportune time for India as the government, after a period of relative peace, looks to resume its development work in the country including through the launch of new projects.Following Muttaqi’s visit, and based on assurances from the Taliban that Afghanistan will not allow its soil to be used for anti-India activities, India restored its embassy in Kabul to further augment its development, humanitarian and capacity-building initiatives for the Afghan people. India has undertaken several projects in Kabul and other areas, including construction of hospitals and trauma centres while also looking to expand trade and investment ties with Afghanistan.Importantly, India is considering an offer from the Taliban to invest in the mining sector, something which China is already actively pursuing. India is also looking to work with Afghanistan on hydroelectric projects to fulfil the local energy needs. For India, this is the time to reap the benefits of a strong working relationship it has built with the Taliban and a regional war, or its possible spillover effects like a humanitarian or refugee crisis, will likely stymie India’s nascent but expanding footprint in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.",India was closely monitoring the situation as afghanistan and pakistan seemed poised for a dangerous escalation.

NEW DELHI: The tension between India and Bangladesh, which resulted in fewer visas by both sides, resulted in an over 9% fall in foreign tourist arrivals to 90.2 lakh in 2025, with the eastern neighbour slipping from the second largest source to being the fifth biggest.Latest official data estimated tourist arrivals from Bangladesh at 4.7 lakh in 2025, 73% lower than the level in the previous year. The 12.8 lakh decline was more than the 9.3 lakh fall in the overall foreign tourist arrivals during the year.Travel industry insiders are not exactly moaning about this decline as they always questioned adding Bangladesh arrivals into FTA numbers as majority of them come for non-tourism purposes such as medical treatment and work and don’t exactly fill up hotels and line up at tourist spots.On the other hand, the number of Indians going abroad rose 6.6% to a record 3.3 crore in 2025, although there was a dip in those going to Saudi Arabia and the US. Last year, the number of Indians flying to Canada also declined nearly 16% to 8 lakh.“India is outpricing itself in terms of star hotel rates despite reasonable domestic airfares in non-peak seasons. So, the Indian middle class now finds it cheaper to go to places like the UAE, CIS countries, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia than going to domestic destinations such as Goa or Kerala.And foreign tourists find a cheaper alternative to us,” said a leading travel agent.Many frequent Indian travellers say they get “good” hotel rooms for Rs 5,000-8,000 in these places while the same in India is at least double in low season and can increase manifold in peak holiday time.Asked about high tariffs, a leading hotelier said: “India is seeing a rise in business travel and domestic travel remains strong. So, we have no reason to worry over foreign tourists skipping till such time that our properties are full. The demand for luxury stays is far more than the supply and this imbalance will ensure good yields (rates) for the big players here.” Indian carriers are also expanding majorly on foreign routes to cash in on the boom in outbound travel.",Tension between india and bangladesh resulted in fewer visas by both sides.

Indian young adults rank lowly 60th in 84-nation mental health study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-young-adults-rank-lowly-60th-in-84-nation-mental-health-study/articleshow/128831188.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young adults in India ranked 60th out of 84 countries in key mental well-being parameters in the 2025 report of an ongoing global mental health study, scoring significantly poorly than their peers aged 18-34 in most parts of the world.The 'Global Mind Health in 2025' released Thursday by US-based Sapien Labs reveals not just a serious mental health crisis among young Indian adults but also a profound generational gap, as older people enjoyed significantly better mental health scores.The report, which surveyed over 78,000 internet-enabled individuals in India, assigned young adults (18-34 years) a low mind health quotient (MHQ) score of 33. This contrasts sharply with an MHQ score of 96 for those aged 55 and above, a level aligning with normal mental function and putting them at rank 49 among 84 countries. This stark difference highlights a ""structural, multi-year generational shift"" in mental well-being that researchers suggest is not merely a temporary effect of recent events like the pandemic.""The scores reflect a very steep decline in younger generations - steeper than many other countries globally.While those aged 55+ are doing fine, younger adults are seriously struggling,"" said Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs.""This reflects declines in the factors we have outlined in the study, and some others, as well such as increased toxic load in the environment (air, water, food) and lack of physical activity,"" she added.The study says the mental health crisis among India's youth goes beyond issues such as anxiety and depression, reflecting a broader reduction in core mental functioning, including the ability to regulate emotions, maintain focus, build stable relationships, and recover from stress.Based on data generated in previous years, the study identifies four key drivers of mental health - family bonds, spirituality, consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) and early exposure to smartphones. In India, the 64% of respondents in the 18-34 age group reported being close to their family, compared to 78% of those over 55.While relatively lower than in some other nations, regular UPF consumption among young Indian adults (44%) was substantially higher than among the older generation (11%). The average age for a first smartphone in India was 16.5 years, a figure expected to be much lower for Gen Alpha, with earlier exposure linked to increased mental health risks.Globally, the study found young adults in economically developed countries struggling with mental health much more than their counterparts in less developed nations. Those at the bottom included Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the UK and China, while countries with relatively better mind health were predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania. Finland, which consistently tops the World Happiness Index, ranked 28 on mind health for those 55+ and 40 for those 18-34 years - indicating that satisfaction with circumstances of life was distinct from mental capacity to navigate life's challenges .The mind health quotient is a metric that aggregates respondent ratings of 47 cognitive, emotional, social and physical capacities and problems that enable or diminish our ability to function effectively. The scale reflects a person's fundamental mental capacity, says Sapien Labs.","Young adults in india ranked 60th out of 84 countries in key mental well-being parameters.

US President Donald Trump has ordered every federal agency to “immediately” stop using technology developed by AI firm Anthropic. In a scathing post on Truth Social, Trump branded the company’s leadership “Leftwing nut jobs”, escalating the growing standoff between the White House and the Pentagon’s AI suppliers.“THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL NEVER ALLOW A RADICAL LEFT, WOKE COMPANY TO DICTATE HOW OUR GREAT MILITARY FIGHTS AND WINS WARS!” Trump wrote. He insisted that decisions about how America wages war “belong to YOUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF”, accusing Anthropic of trying to “STRONG-ARM the Department of War” into following its terms of service “instead of our Constitution”.Trump claimed the company’s “selfishness is putting AMERICAN LIVES at risk” and placing national security “in JEOPARDY”. He directed “EVERY Federal Agency” to cease using Anthropic’s technology at once, adding there would be a six-month phase-out for departments currently relying on its products. “We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” he wrote, warning of “major civil and criminal consequences” if the company failed to cooperate.The showdown follows days of mounting tension between the administration and Anthropic, whose chatbot Claude has been adopted in parts of the US government, including classified settings.The dispute centres on safeguards the company says are necessary to prevent its AI being used for mass surveillance of Americans or in fully autonomous weapons systems.Anthropic chief executive Dario Amodei has drawn a firm line, saying the company “cannot in good conscience accede” to Pentagon demands for broader usage rights. The Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth , has reportedly warned that refusal could lead to the contract being cancelled or the firm being labelled a “supply chain risk”.The clash has divided Silicon Valley. Elon Musk publicly backed the administration, while Sam Altman voiced sympathy for Anthropic’s safety concerns, saying he largely trusted the company’s intentions.=","Us president donald trump has ordered every federal agency to ‘immediately’ stop using technology developed by ai firm anthropic.

Foxborough select board vice chairman Bill Yunka and local business owner Terri Lawton speak out on Robert Kraft and World Cup costs

The clock is ticking with the World Cup just over 100 days away, but in Foxborough, Massachusetts, growing tension surrounds Robert Kraft and his stadium.The small town of 18,000 people has refused to approve a license for World Cup matches at Gillette Stadium unless someone agrees to cover an 8 million dollar security bill. The stadium, home of the New England Patriots, is set to host seven matches starting June 13, including knockout games. But town leaders say they cannot risk bankruptcy to make it happen.The issue is simple. Under Fifa’s agreement, host cities must pay for police, public safety, and security. In the NFL season, the Kraft Group handles those costs. For the World Cup, the stadium is leased to Fifa, and the financial responsibility shifts. The five member Foxborough select board has set a March 17 deadline to approve the license. Without financial guarantees, they say the doors could stay closed.Vice Chairman Bill Yunka told local outlet WCVB that hosting the World Cup would be like staging “an NFL game on steroids” and equal to “39 Super Bowls.” Fifa requires stadium security for all 39 days of the tournament, not just match days. That pushes costs even higher.Terri Lawton, who owns Oake Knoll family farm near the stadium, told The U.S. Sun that the town is scared of being left with the bill.“I think the select board is doing a great job trying to protect residents,” she said.“We’re a very small town. We don’t have 8 million dollars to front and even if we did, we shouldn’t.”She added that spreading the cost across 18,000 residents would hurt basic services.“We wouldn’t be able to pay teachers, police, or firefighters. This isn’t emotional. It’s business.”Lawton believes Robert Kraft, whose wealth is estimated above 13 billion dollars, should step in.“If they want this to happen, the Kraft Group can simply write a check,” she said.Boston was allocated 46 million dollars from a federal funding plan, but delays and a federal shutdown have slowed payments through FEMA. Yunka said the Kraft Group is willing to front money equal to the expected grant, but that still leaves a gap of several million dollars.Under the current lease signed in 2000, Foxborough earns only 67 cents per ticket sold. Ticket prices have risen, but the town’s share has not changed.Fifa keeps most revenue from tickets, broadcasting, sponsorships, and parking. Meanwhile, host cities cover security, transport, and protection for officials including Fifa president Gianni Infantino.With the World Cup approaching, Foxborough leaders say they are not against soccer. They just cannot risk the town’s future.","Fifa world cup chaos in foxborough as town refuses license without $8 million security promise from robert kraft.

Iran Military Warns Trump Against 'Unwise Action' As Talks End Without Deal

UK embassy operates remotely

China urges evacuation from Iran

US allows staff to leave Israel

Major US military build-up

Talks continue despite tensions

Public anxiety inside Iran

UN raises alarm





Britain, the United States and China have taken precautionary steps in the Middle East as fears of a possible conflict with Iran intensify.The UK government confirmed on Friday that staff at its embassy in Tehran have been temporarily withdrawn because of the current “security situation”.Earlier in the day, Washington authorised the departure of non-emergency personnel from Israel, while Beijing urged its citizens to leave Iran “as soon as possible”.The moves come amid repeated threats by US President Donald Trump to strike Iran and as the United States carries out what AFP described as its biggest military build-up in decades in the Middle East and Mediterranean region.The British Foreign Office said the UK embassy in Tehran, which had already been temporarily closed last month, would continue to “operate remotely”, according to AFP.Britain’s decision follows rising tensions after the latest round of Oman-mediated talks between Iran and the United States in Geneva.Although both Iranian and Omani officials described Thursday’s discussions as positive, Washington has not publicly commented on their outcome.China also issued strong travel advisories on Friday.Beijing’s foreign ministry said Chinese nationals currently in Iran should “strengthen safety precautions and evacuate as soon as possible”, according to a statement cited by AFP.It further advised citizens to avoid travelling to Iran “for the time being in light of the current security situation”.Chinese embassies and consulates in Iran and neighbouring countries will provide “necessary assistance” to those seeking to leave via commercial flights or overland routes, the ministry added.Meanwhile, China’s embassy in Israel warned its nationals to remain highly vigilant, avoid unnecessary travel and familiarise themselves with nearby bomb shelters and evacuation routes, state broadcaster CCTV reported.In a parallel move, the United States authorised non-emergency embassy staff and their families to leave Israel “due to safety risks”, AFP reported.The US embassy in Israel said on its website: “Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available.”The New York Times reported that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee emailed staff urging those who wished to depart to do so “TODAY”.The state department also confirmed that US secretary of state Marco Rubio will travel to Israel on Monday for talks focused on Iran and wider regional issues. State department spokesman Tommy Pigott said Rubio would discuss “a range of regional priorities including Iran, Lebanon and ongoing efforts to implement President Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza”, as per AFP.Rubio’s visit comes at a time when the US is reinforcing its military presence in the region.The US military is deploying additional forces, including the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which is due to arrive off the coast of Israel.Washington already had more than a dozen warships in the Middle East, including another aircraft carrier, before ordering the Gerald R Ford to the region.In his recent State of the Union address, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions” and claimed it was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States. Tehran has consistently denied the allegations, insisting its nuclear programme is peaceful and dismissing the claims as “big lies”.The diplomatic moves come just a day after Oman-mediated negotiations between Tehran and Washington in Geneva, seen as a last-ditch effort to prevent war.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said success required “seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”.Following the talks, Araghchi told state television that negotiations had “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”.He indicated that the next round could take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical discussions at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) scheduled to begin in Vienna on Monday.Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi also spoke of “significant progress” in a post on X.However, Iran has insisted that discussions focus solely on nuclear matters, while Washington wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for militant groups curtailed.In Tehran, some residents voiced scepticism about US intentions but expressed hope that diplomacy would ease economic hardship caused by sanctions.“Whatever the outcome of the negotiations… it should lead to some improvement in people’s economic situation. Not just a little — it is our right,” 34-year-old Ali Bagheri said, as quoted by AFP.Another resident, Hamid Beiranvand, said Iran should “not give any concessions” because Washington “breaks promises”, but added that “everyone prefers that a war doesn’t happen”.Iran has faced rising domestic pressure amid high living costs. Protests in December led to a crackdown that, according to rights groups, killed thousands.The UN’s human rights chief, Volker Turk, said he was “extremely alarmed” at the risk of wider regional escalation and urged restraint.“I hope the voice of reason prevails,” he said.With diplomatic talks continuing but military deployments increasing, the region remains on edge.For now, governments are balancing dialogue with precaution, even as uncertainty over the outcome of US-Iran negotiations deepens.",Staff at uk embassy in tehran temporarily withdrawn because of'security situation' china urges its citizens to leave iran 'as soon as possible' us allows non-emergency personnel to leave israel due to'safety risks' comes amid repeated threats by us president donald trump to strike iran.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128859269,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-118828,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
"Mohammed bin Salman urged Donald Trump to impose sanctions on UAE, report claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mohammed-bin-salman-urged-donald-trump-to-impose-sanctions-on-uae-report-claims/articleshow/128858502.cms,"'Don't Support Israeli Expansionism': US Tells Arabs After MBS Leads Muslim Fury Against Trump Envoy





Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had urged US President Donald Trump to consider sanctions tied to the Emirati govt’s support for an armed group fighting in Sudan’s civil war, the New York Times reported.Amid the feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Donald Trump came and had a November conversation that reportedly turned Gulf whispers into a full-blown war.A Saudi official offered a different account, saying that Prince Mohammed asked Trump to place additional sanctions on the Sudanese armed group to prevent it from getting external support, not to impose measures on the Emirates directly.The Saudi leadership made the request because it believed that if the Emirati govt backed down, the war in Sudan would end, according to the official. A US official said that Prince Mohammed never asked President Trump to impose sanctions on the Emirates, but did not comment on the call.While the details are in dispute, the fallout is not. Soon after Trump’s call, latent tensions between the Saudi and Emirati govts erupted into a public feud. The information relayed by Trump infuriated senior Emirati officials, who felt betrayed by Saudi Arabia, once one of their closest allies, the four people briefed on the conversation said.Relations rapidly deteriorated, hitting a nadir in December when Saudi Arabia bombed an Emirati shipment to Yemen.The discord between the two neighbours, both oil-rich countries that have cultivated vast global influence, has far-reaching consequences, with the potential to move markets and exacerbate wars. Their competition for dominance in the region has already reshaped the future of Yemen and threatens to worsen conflicts in the Horn of Africa, where the two powers have situated themselves on opposing sides in multiple countries. The rift also presents a potential diplomatic headache for the Trump administration, which hopes to win support from both Saudi Arabia and the Emirates for its Middle East policies, including in Gaza and Iran.The four people briefed by the Emirati officials all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatically sensitive conversations, as did the US official and the Saudi official. The Emirati foreign ministry declined to comment on the call.Sudan’s devastating civil war previously received little attention from the Trump administration. Saudi Arabia supports the Sudanese armed forces, while the Emirates has been the principal backer of the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, a paramilitary group fighting for control of the country. There is substantial evidence that the Emirates has funnelled money, weapons and drones to the RSFIn recent months, the Emirates faced growing international criticism as the RSF has been accused of committing massacres and other grave human rights violations, particularly around the city of El Fasher in Darfur. United Nations-backed experts said last week that the RSF campaign bore the “hallmarks of genocide.”The Emirati govt in a statement to The New York Times said this week that it “categorically rejects allegations” it has given material support to the RSF It said that its role in the war is limited to providing humanitarian aid and supporting cease-fire efforts.A decade ago, Sheikh Mohammed and Prince Mohammed were close partners, largely aligned in their priorities across the region. They joined forces in a disastrous military intervention in Yemen to beat back Houthi rebels. They later partnered in an effort to isolate another Gulf state, Qatar, accusing its govt of supporting terrorism, which Qatar denied.Over the past few years, Prince Mohammed turned Saudi Arabia’s focus inward, emphasising that it needs stability in the Middle East in order to successfully diversify its economy. His ambitions to turn the kingdom into a global business and tourism hub have increasingly butted up against those of Dubai, the largest Emirati city and the Middle East’s financial capital. Sheikh Mohammed, in contrast, pursued a more assertive foreign policy for the Emirates. That strategy appears to be rooted, at least partly, in antagonism toward Islamism, which he views as a regional and national security threat.Privately, some Emirati officials say that they see the RSF in Sudan as an ally in this broader battle, because they are fighting against the Sudanese military, which they say has dangerous Islamist tendencies. Scholars have also posited that the Emirati leadership has developed semi-imperial ambitions, using their wealth to garner influence and resources far from their borders. The Emirates has become one of the biggest investors on the African continent.The war in Sudan, raging since 2023, appears to have become a major flashpoint in the past year. For Prince Mohammed, Sudan’s conflict presents a potential security threat, raising the spectre of a failed state just across the Red Sea from his country. And so, the Saudi official said, after two years of trying to convince the Emirates to cut ties with the group, Saudi Arabia sought assistance from the United States.It remains unclear exactly what Prince Mohammed told Trump during his visit to the White House in November, though it appears he did ask the president to help forge peace in Sudan. At a Saudi-US business forum held during the visit, Trump gave a speech in which he said that he would look into resolving the conflict, at Prince Mohammed’s behest.“His Majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,” Trump said. “We’re going to start working on it.”The potential involvement of the Trump administration, whatever shape it took, threatened to compound international pressure on the Emirates over its role in the war. Since the phone call in November, the Emirati leadership remains convinced that the Saudi leader requested US sanctions on the country, three of the people briefed by senior Emirati officials said. According to two of those people, Trump told Sheikh Mohammed that his friends were out to get him, but that Trump had his back.In the weeks after the prince’s visit to Washington, friction between Saudi Arabia and the Emirates escalated sharply. The consequences played out most dramatically in Yemen, another country where their interests had long diverged.In December, an armed Yemeni separatist group backed by the Emirates led a lightning offensive into a region in the south of the country, close to the Saudi border. The Saudis saw those moves as a threat to their national security and bombed an Emirati shipment to Yemen, accusing the Emirates of sending weapons to the group.The Emirati govt denied that accusation and announced that it would withdraw its own troops from Yemen immediately. That left the separatist group in the lurch as Saudi-backed forces advanced, taking back all the territory they had seized.The Saudi leadership believes the Emirati govt put the separatist group’s offensive into motion because of their anger over the sanctions call, the Saudi official said. The Emirati foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on that allegation. Instead, it pointed to a recent public statement by Anwar Gargash, a senior Emirati official, who had dismissed anti-Emirati rhetoric as “noise.”The Biden administration, which privately confronted the Emirati leadership over its support for the RSF, tried to smooth over tensions between the two Gulf nations so as to encourage regional cooperation, according to two former American officials. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.So far, the Trump administration avoided publicly taking a side between the two countries, both of which have extensive business ties with the president’s family.An investment firm tied to the Emirati govt quietly purchased nearly half of the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company last year, The Wall Street Journal reported in January. In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund recently teamed up with a private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, to carry out a $55 billion buyout of a video game publisher.Asked by a journalist on February 16 if he was involved in the rift between Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, Trump said he was not, but he could be.“We can get it settled very easily,” he said. “That’s an easy one to settle.”","Crown prince mohammed bin salman urged us president donald trump to consider sanctions tied to the emirati govt’s support for an armed group fighting in sudan.

Gavin Tucker bids adieu to MMA despite UFC announcing his next bout



The UFC’s recent announcement about a fight between Gavin Tucker and Doo Ho Choi has created confusion. The promotion confirmed the featherweight bout for April 18 at UFC Winnipeg. However, fresh reports suggest that the fight will not happen after all. According to multiple sources, Tucker has already decided to retire from mixed martial arts. This development has raised questions about how the matchup was announced in the first place.The news surprised many fans because the UFC had listed the fight as official just minutes before reports of Tucker’s retirement surfaced. Journalist Marcel Dorff claimed that Tucker never signed the bout agreement. Another source, RealKevinK, stated that Tucker personally confirmed his decision to step away from the sport. If true, this means the fight announcement was made despite the veteran already ending his career.Reports revealed that the scheduled featherweight clash between Gavin Tucker and Doo Ho Choi will not take place on April 18. The UFC had recently promoted several fights for its return to Canada, including this matchup.But according to journalist Marcel Dorff, the Canadian fighter had already retired when the fight was announced.Dorff explained that even though the bout was publicized shortly before his update, Tucker had not signed any contract to make it official. He also stated that the fight would not move forward because the athlete had stepped away from competition.RealKevinK later shared that he had spoken directly with Tucker. The fighter reportedly confirmed that he is ending his career due to the physical damage he has suffered over the years.Tucker competed in the featherweight division and held a 4-3 record inside the Octagon. His last appearance came in August 2023, when he suffered a submission defeat to Diego Lopes. Since then, he has not fought.UFC Winnipeg is set for April 18 at the Canada Life Center. The event is headlined by a welterweight contest between Gilbert Burns and Mike Malott.While announcing a fight involving a retired athlete is unusual, promoting bouts before contracts are signed has happened before. Renato Moicano recently revealed that he has not yet signed for his April 4 main event against Chris Duncan, even though it was already announced. In a past case, Dustin Poirier initially denied that his bout with Benoit Saint-Denis was confirmed before it eventually took place.","Gavin tucker reportedly retires despite ufc announcing april 18 featherweight fight with doo ho choi.
