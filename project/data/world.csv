NEW DELHI: Expressing admiration for Donald Trump’s courage and resilience, PM Narendra Modi said his connect with the US president was that they both put nation first and had dedicated themselves to the service of the nation.“Even after being shot (July 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Modi’s emphatic endorsement of Trump in a podcast with Lex Fridman, popular podcaster and research scientist at MIT, comes at a time US allies, particularly Europe and Canada, are taking a heavy battering from the president who has been accused by some of dragging America into isolationism with his policies.India itself has been under threat from Trump’s tariff war but is hoping for an exemption from the Apr 2 deadline for reciprocal tariffs, based on a trade deal it’s negotiating.Trump was far more prepared in his second term, with a clear roadmap and steps to achieve his goals, the PM said, adding that he had put together a “strong, capable” team to assist him.In the podcast, Modi backed the recent thaw in ties with China said said normalcy had returned to the border since his meeting with President Xi Jinping last year, and that trust, enthusiasm and energy would return in bilateral ties “slowly but surely”. He said efforts were on to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.On Pakistan, while describing it as the epicentre of terrorism, Modi said all Indian attempts for a reconciliation had met with hostility and expressed hope Pakistan will choose the right path as its people deserved a future free of violence.On the Russia-Ukraine war, Modi strongly reiterated India’s position that both countries need to return to the negotiating table.“I can tell President Putin this is not the era of war. I can also tell President Zelensky that regardless of how many people stand with you, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield. Ukraine may hold countless discussions with its allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both sides,” he said, adding the current situation provided an opportunity for meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine. “I am not neutral. I strive for peace,” he said, underlining India’s position and expressing concern about how the war has hurt the Global South.Asked about his relations with Trump, Modi appreciat ed the “trust” that the president has in him. “Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. Trump’s will to live and fight for the US even after being shot appeals to me because this showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India First and that’s why I connect so well (with Trump),” the PM said.Asked what he liked about Trump, Modi recalled that the US president, during his first term, had ignored security protocol and agreed to his request to take a lap around the stadium hosting the ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston. “I was touched by his courage and his trust in me,” he said.On Trump describing him as a tough negotiator, Modi said he always puts India’s interests first. “That’s why in every forum, I speak up for India’s interest, not to harm anyone but in a positive manner and because of that, no one takes offence,” he said.On China, Modi said differences between the two countries were natural but “our focus is on ensuring these don’t turn into disputes”. “Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue for building cooperative relationship. After my meeting with President Xi, we are seeing a return of normalcy to the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm and energy will return,” he said.“Of course, it will take some time because of the five-year gap. Our cooperation is essential also for global stability and prosperity. Since the 21st century will be Asia’s century, we want India and China to compete in a healthy way. Competition is not a bad thing but it should never turn into a conflict,” he added.","Pm narendra modi said his connect with the us president was that they both put nation first. “even after being shot (july 2024), he remained unwaveringly dedicated to america.

Watch: 31 killed in Yemen after Trump orders airstrike on Houthi rebels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-launches-airstrikes-in-yemen-as-trump-vows-to-stop-houthi-attacks-rebels-react/articleshow/119057577.cms,"US strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen

Who are the Houthis?

Who backs Houthi rebels?

Major attacks by Houthis

At least 31 people were killed after US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Houthi-held areas in Yemen, reported news agency Reuters.Houthis, the militant group in Yemen, has claimed that the US strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital Sanaa on Saturday.The aerial strikes against the Yemeni rebel group came after Trump vowed to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" in the back of the Houthis' operations in the Red Sea.The airstrikes also mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump’s administration began in January amid the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict.Before the strike Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Houthis' threats to Red Sea shipping.The Houthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".""This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television.Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran ""axis of resistance"" groups opposing Israel and the United States.They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa.The US has conducted multiple strikes on Houthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Houthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory.Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"" he added.The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, are a Zaidi Shia rebel group from northern Yemen, primarily based in Saada province. They emerged in the 1990s as a religious-political movement opposing Saudi-backed Sunni influence and Western interference in Yemen.The group was founded by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed in 2004 by Yemeni government forces, triggering an ongoing conflict. Though Zaidi Shia Islam is distinct from the Twelver Shia Islam of Iran, the Houthis have received military and financial support from Iran, leading to accusations that they serve as an Iranian proxy.The group gained global attention in 2014 when they took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, forcing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and sparking a war with the Saudi-led coalition in 2015. Since then, they have engaged in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and recently, international shipping vessels in the Red Sea.Their attacks, particularly on Israel-linked ships, have drawn US and UK airstrikes in retaliation. The Houthis claim these actions are in support of Palestine, but their increasing aggression in the region has led to fears of wider conflict.Currently, they control much of northern Yemen, running a parallel government while continuing their fight against Yemeni government forces, Saudi Arabia, and UAE-backed militias.The Houthis primarily receive support from Iran, which provides them with weapons, military training, and financial assistance. Iran sees the Houthis as a useful ally in its broader strategy to counter Saudi Arabia and expand its influence in the region. The Lebanese Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed group, has also reportedly provided military training and strategic guidance to the Houthis.In addition to Iran and Hezbollah, the Houthis have received support from various local tribes in Yemen, particularly those opposed to Saudi influence. Some reports suggest that North Korea has also secretly supplied them with weapons, though this is less confirmed.The Houthis claim to be fighting against Western imperialism, and in recent conflicts, they have aligned themselves with the Iran-led ""Axis of Resistance"", which includes groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and various militias in Iraq and Syria.The Houthis have carried out several major attacks, disrupting global security and trade. In September 2019, they launched drone and missile strikes on Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, temporarily halving Saudi oil production. In January 2022, they attacked Abu Dhabi with drones and missiles, killing three people and targeting an oil facility and the international airport.Throughout 2021-2022, they launched ballistic missiles at Saudi cities, including a strike on a Jeddah oil depot during a Formula 1 race. Since late 2023, they have attacked Red Sea shipping, claiming to target Israel-linked vessels, leading to US and UK airstrikes on Houthi positions.In November 2023, they hijacked the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked ship, escalating tensions further. Their increasing use of advanced drones and missiles has turned them into a key regional threat.","Houthis, the militant group in yemen, has claimed that the us strikes killed civilians, including children in the capital sanaa on saturday.

NEW DELHI: A top Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist, Abu Qatal , also known as Qatal Sindhi, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.Qatal was a key operative of the terror outfit, notorious for masterminding multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. As a close aide of Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, Qatal's influence and reach were extensive. His involvement in terror activities dates back to 2002-03, when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri range, according to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Qatal's killing is significant, given his role in planning and executing terror attacks. His demise may disrupt Lashkar-e-Taiba's operations, but the group's ability to adapt and regroup remains a concern.The notorious terrorist created a proxy terror outfit called People's Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF). These groups were formed to conceal the activities of other terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish, which have been active since 2019.The terrorist played a pivotal role in the devastating attack on a bus carrying pilgrims returning from the Shiv Khori temple in Reasi on June 9. Tragically, nine people lost their lives, including seven pilgrims from outside Jammu and Kashmir, and 41 others were injured when terrorists opened fire on the bus.It's worth noting that PAFF was designated as a terrorist group by ministry of home affairs since January 7, 2023. The group has been responsible for several attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, targeting Indian forces and civilians alike.","Qatal was a key operative of the terror outfit, notorious for masterminding attacks in jammu and kashmir.

PM Modi on governance: ‘From appeasement to aspiration’

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative, adding that despite efforts by his political opponents to hold him responsible, the courts found him innocent.Speaking in a podcast with Lex Fridman, which was released on Sunday, PM Modi refuted claims that the 2002 riots were the ""biggest riots ever"", calling it “misinformation.”""On February 24, 2002, I became a state representative, an elected representative for the first time. And it was only around February 24th, 25th, or 26th that I stepped into the Gujarat Assembly for the very first time. On February 27th, 2002, we were seated in the Assembly for the budget session. And that same day, it had been just three days since I’d become a state representative, when suddenly the horrific Godhra incident occurred,"" PM Modi said.""It was a tragedy of unimaginable magnitude, people were burned alive. You can imagine, against the backdrop of incidents like the Kandahar hijacking, the attack on Parliament, or even 9/11, and then to have so many people killed and burned alive, you can imagine how tense and volatile the situation was. Of course, this was tragic for everyone. Everyone prefers peace,"" he said.PM Modi cited the 1969 riots, which lasted over six months, as an example of Gujarat’s history of communal violence, emphasising that these incidents occurred long before he entered politics.""The perception that these were the biggest riots ever is actually misinformation. If you review the data from before 2002, you will see that Gujarat faced frequent riots. Curfews were constantly being imposed somewhere. Communal violence could erupt over trivial issues, like kite flying contests or even minor bicycle collisions. Before 2002, Gujarat witnessed over 250 significant riots. The riots in 1969 lasted nearly six months. So there was a long history, long before I was in the picture,"" he said.""But that one tragic incident in 2002 became a sparking point, leading some people towards violence. Yet, the judiciary thoroughly investigated the matter.The prime minister asserted that allegations against him were politically motivated, claiming that his opponents, who were in power at the Centre at the time, wanted to see him punished.“At that time, our political opponents were in power, and naturally they wanted all allegations against us to stick. Despite their relentless efforts, the judiciary analyzed the situation meticulously twice and ultimately found us completely innocent. Those who were truly responsible have faced justice from the courts,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi noted that the state, which once saw regular communal violence, has remained peaceful since 2002. “In the past 22 years, Gujarat has not witnessed a single major riot. The state remains completely peaceful,” he said.Fridman followed up by asking Modi how he perceives criticism, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics like the Gujarat riots ""Criticism is the soul of democracy,"" Modi responded. ""Our scriptures say: ‘Always keep your critics close,’ because they help you improve.""However, he was quick to differentiate between constructive criticism and what he called ""sensationalism"" in modern political discourse.“Genuine criticism is based on research and analysis. Unfortunately, today’s media and political opponents often take shortcuts, making unfounded accusations instead of engaging in thoughtful critique,” he said. “The references you’re giving, they are allegations, not criticism.”PM Modi suggested that much of the opposition he faced over the years stemmed from ideological biases rather than factual concerns.“Those who criticised me for the riots did not care about Gujarat’s history of violence before 2002. They were not interested in the transformation that happened after,” he said. “They only wanted to create a narrative that suited their agenda.”Moving beyond the riots, PM Modi outlined what he sees as his administration’s biggest achievement—shifting India’s political culture from ""appeasement politics"" to ""aspirational politics.""""For decades, politics was about appeasement—keeping certain groups happy for votes. We changed that. We focused on aspirational politics, where governance is about delivering results for everyone, not just selected communities,” he said.Modi reiterated his government's guiding principle: ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas"" (Together with everyone, development for all, trust from all, and efforts by everyone).“We have ensured that governance reaches the last person in the queue, regardless of caste, creed, or religion,” he added. “Whether it’s housing, electricity, sanitation, or digital payments, every Indian benefits. That is true development.”","Prime minister narendra modi said that the discourse surrounding the 2002 post-godhra riots in gujarat was an attempt to push a false narrative.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in an interview with US-based podcaster and AI researcher Lex Fridman on Sunday, spoke about global conflicts and the role of international organizations . He said that organizations that were once powerful have now become almost irrelevant.PM Modi said, ""Today, I see so many kinds of conflicts happening. Physical battles often get discussed. Struggles are happening in every domain. International organizations that were once powerful have become almost irrelevant.""He added, ""No real reforms are happening. Institutions like the UN are failing to fulfil their roles. People who disregard international laws and rules, continue to act freely, and no one can stop them.""The conversation, which lasted nearly three hours, covered topics related to leadership, diplomacy, and global challenges.

""We must also understand that the world has become one small village today. No country can thrive in isolation. Today, we all depend upon one another. No one can make it far by themselves. That is why you must learn to synchronize with everyone and everyone else must learn to synchronize with you. That’s the only way to propel this initiative forward. Organizations like the United Nations came into being after the First World War, but they failed to evolve with the times, and this inability to adapt has sparked a global debate on their relevance,"" he said.PM Modi also spoke about rising geopolitical tensions , mentioning conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and US-China relations. ""Look, Covid exposed the limitations of every nation. No matter how much we consider ourselves as a great nation, no matter how progressive we think we are, or how scientifically advanced we believe we’ve become, everyone has their own way of looking at things. In the end, we all found ourselves on the same ground. Every country in the world faced this reality. At that time, it felt like the world would learn from it, that we would move toward a more unified world. Just as a geopolitical order emerged after World War II, many thought something similar would happen post-Covid. But unfortunately, instead of moving towards peace, the world became even more fragmented, ushering in a period of uncertainty, and the wars have only made it worse,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi spoke about global conflicts and the role of international organizations.

He showed me where Abraham Lincoln lived and where key moments in history took place. It showed his deep connection with America’s legacy.""Even after Trump's first term ended, PM Modi said the US President continued to express warmth. ""Whenever someone we both knew met him, he would say, ‘Modi is my friend, convey my regards.’ That kind of gesture is rare.""When asked about Trump calling him a ""much tougher and better negotiator,"" PM Modi downplayed the remark, saying, ""That’s his graciousness. I always put my country first, and people know that if I am in a negotiation, I will advocate for India's interests.""PM Modi also observed that Trump seems more prepared for a second term, with a clear roadmap and a strong team. “I have observed President Trump both during his first term and now in his second run.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi shared an interesting moment during his conversation with Lex Fridman from his visit to the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, revealing how his practice of fasting became a topic of discussionAs part of the formal itinerary, a high-level bilateral meeting was followed by a state dinner.However, there was a moment of concern among US officials when they realised that PM Modi was fasting. “How do you host the leader of such a major nation at the White House without serving food?” they wondered.When dinner was served, PM Modi simply placed a glass of hot water in front of him. To lighten the mood, he turned to Obama and quipped, “Look, my dinner has arrived.”The incident left a lasting impression on the former US President. When PM Modi visited the White House again later, this time for a lunch meeting, Obama greeted him with a smile and a playful remark: “Last time you were fasting, this time we’re having lunch. Since you’re not fasting, you’ll have to eat twice as much.”During his conversation with Lex Fridman, PM Modi also explained that fasting had been an integral part of his life for over 50 years. He revealed that he never intended to make it public, but after he became chief minister and later Prime Minister, people started noticing his routine.“Most of the time, I don’t even let people know about it. It’s my personal matter,” he said, adding that he only spoke about it if asked, hoping his experience could help others.He described fasting not just as a religious or cultural practice but as a deeply scientific and spiritual discipline. “Fasting is not just about skipping meals. If someone goes hungry due to hardship, that’s not fasting. True fasting is a process of inner discipline and balance,” he explained.He shared how fasting sharpens the senses and enhances awareness. “You may notice the aroma of water, something you never realised before. A flower you have seen a thousand times appears more vivid. The mind gains clarity, and thoughts flow effortlessly”, he said.PM Modi also spoke about his rigorous fasting schedule, particularly during Chaturmas, when he eats only once a day for over four months, and Navratri, when he fasts for nine days, consuming only hot water or a single fruit.Despite this, he continues his responsibilities without any disruption. “Fasting never slows me down. Sometimes I even work more,” he said, adding that his discipline had only strengthened his ability to lead effectively.","Pm modi reveals obama’s light-hearted remark on his fasting.

NEW DELHI: In a podcast with Lex Fridman , Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in detail about India’s troubled relationship with Pakistan while calling out the neighbouring country for state-sponsored terrorism and failed peace efforts .The discussion, which was part of a three-hour-long podcast episode released on Sunday, explored India's historical ties with Pakistan, past attempts at fostering diplomacy and PM Modi’s vision for the future of bilateral relations .Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan. Take the September 11 attacks, for example. The mastermind behind it, Osama bin Laden—where did he eventually emerge from? He had taken refuge in Pakistan. The world has recognized that in a way terrorism and the terrorist mindset are deeply rooted in Pakistan,"" he said.PM Modi further called Pakistan an "" epicentre of turmoil "", urging its leadership to ""abandon the path of terrorism"" and work towards peace. He also mentioned that the people of Pakistan themselves long for peace, as they have suffered from years of internal unrest and terrorist violence.When Fridman asked PM Modi about past attempts to improve India-Pakistan relations , PM Modi recalled his historic invitation to Pakistan’s then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for his swearing-in ceremony in 2014.""My first attempt at improving bilateral relations was when I invited my Pakistani counterpart to my swearing-in. It was a gesture of goodwill, a diplomatic gesture unlike any in decades,"" he said.He also elaborated on his surprise visit to Lahore in 2015, aimed at fostering better ties between the two countries. However, he lamented that every peace initiative was met with hostility and betrayal from Pakistan.""Yet, every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal. We sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace,"" PM Modi added.PM Modi’s discussion with Fridman is part of the American podcaster’s globally popular show, which has featured influential figures like Elon Musk, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.Fridman had earlier described the interview as “one of the most powerful conversations” of his life.","Pm modi on india-pakistan relations on podcast with lex fridman.

Fridman’s reflection on Modi’s leadership

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a nearly three-hour conversation with AI researcher and podcaster Lex Fridman, delved into his views on leadership, diplomacy, and personal discipline. The episode, released Sunday evening, marks Modi’s second podcast appearance this year, following his January discussion with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath.During the conversation, PM Modi emphasized the collective identity he represents as India's leader. ""My strength lies not in my name, but in the backing of 1.4 billion Indians and thousands of years of timeless culture and heritage. When I shake hands with a world leader, it's not Modi, but 1.4 billion Indians doing so,"" he said.He highlighted India's role in promoting global peace, citing figures like Gautama Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. ""India is the land of Buddha and Gandhi. We do not seek conflict; we stand for harmony. Wherever we can act as peacemakers, we embrace that responsibility,"" he stated.Reflecting on his upbringing, PM Modi spoke about experiencing extreme poverty. ""We never felt the burden of poverty because we had no means of comparison. If you've never worn shoes, you don’t know what it’s like to miss them,"" he said, underscoring the resilience of his early years.Modi also discussed his diplomatic efforts, recalling how he invited Pakistan to his swearing-in ceremony as an olive branch. ""We sincerely hope wisdom prevails and they choose peace,"" he said, noting past attempts at fostering dialogue were met with hostility.On dealing with criticism, the Prime Minister welcomed it, said, ""Criticism is the soul of democracy. It helps refine governance and decision-making.""Fridman, who was fasting on water for two days in honor of the conversation, asked Modi about his own fasting habits. Modi shared that fasting has been an integral part of his life for over five decades, not just as a religious observance but as a means of inner discipline.“Fasting is not just about giving up food. It sharpens the senses, accelerates thinking, and brings clarity. I see it as a powerful tool for balance and self-discipline,” PM Modi explained.He described his long-standing practice of fasting during Navratri, where he abstains from food for nine days, consuming only hot water. “Even while fasting, I carry out my responsibilities as usual—meeting world leaders, managing governance, and making key decisions,” he added.Modi also recalled his first fasting experience as a child, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s movement for cow protection. “I felt neither hunger nor desire for food—just a new awareness and energy,” he said, attributing his belief in fasting to personal experience rather than religious teachings.Discussing his approach to international relations, Modi mentioned his outreach to Pakistan at the beginning of his tenure, including inviting then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony. “We sincerely hope wisdom prevails and they choose peace,” he remarked, highlighting India’s consistent efforts toward regional stability.On dealing with criticism, Modi stated that he welcomes it as an essential aspect of democracy. “Criticism refines governance and decision-making,” he said.""No matter how dark the night may seem, morning is bound to come."" This was the essence of the advice given, emphasizing patience and self-confidence. The message stressed that challenges are real, but they do not define an individual. Instead, difficulties serve as a test of endurance, strengthening personal growth rather than inducing despair.The speaker highlighted the importance of unwavering faith, stating, ""I am here for a purpose, sent by a higher power. And I am not alone; the one who sent me is always with me."" The emphasis was on embracing hardships as opportunities for growth. A key lesson shared was, ""There are no shortcuts in life. Shortcut will cut you short."" Patience, perseverance, and dedication were underscored as the pillars of success.Additionally, the speaker encouraged a mindset of continuous learning, stating, ""One should never let the student within them die."" The importance of striving to contribute rather than merely accumulating wealth was also highlighted. A shift from focusing on what one can gain to what one can give was recommended, reinforcing the belief that true fulfillment stems from contributions to society.During a period of self-exploration, the speaker spent two years roaming the Himalayas, leading a minimalist, nomadic existence. This phase was marked by rigorous self-experimentation, testing physical endurance against natural elements. Reading about Swami Vivekananda and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj inspired a quest to understand their way of life and personal discipline.An impactful lesson was drawn from Swami Vivekananda's experience with Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Vivekananda, urged by Ramakrishna to seek blessings from Goddess Kali for his ailing mother, found himself unable to ask for anything. This realization shifted his focus from receiving to giving. The story left a deep impression, reinforcing the idea that ""true contentment comes from giving.""A philosophical takeaway from this journey was the recognition of non-duality: ""If you wish to serve Shiva, serve all living beings."" The belief in the unity between the divine and humanity was a profound realization gained from this period of reflection and exploration.PM Modi emphasized that India is not just a geographical entity but a civilization that has thrived for thousands of years. ""India is a cultural identity. It is a civilization that dates back thousands of years,"" he said, highlighting the vast linguistic and cultural diversity across the country.Modi pointed to shared traditions that unify Indians despite regional differences. ""From the south to the north, you will see immense diversity. But if you dig a little deeper, you will find a common thread,"" he explained, using the example of Lord Ram’s presence across different parts of India.He also spoke about the importance of rituals in preserving India's historical continuity. ""We invoke the entire universe before beginning any ritual, from Jambudweep to Bharatkhand, Aryavrat, and finally to our specific family deity. This practice is still alive in every corner of India,"" he noted.Reflecting on Mahatma Gandhi, Modi acknowledged his deep personal connection with the leader as a fellow Gujarati. ""Gandhi had great opportunities abroad, but he gave up all comforts to serve the people of India,"" Modi remarked, stressing Gandhi's ability to turn ordinary citizens into participants in the freedom movement.He recounted how Gandhi transformed simple acts, like weaving cloth or tending to lepers, into symbols of India's independence struggle. ""He viewed every task as a vital thread in the fabric of India’s independence movement,"" Modi said, adding that the Salt March was an example of how Gandhi mobilized the masses through nonviolent resistance.The podcast also explored India's growing influence in world affairs. When asked about balancing power and diplomacy, Modi dismissed the idea of ruling by fear. ""My strength lies not in my name, but in the backing of 1.4 billion Indians and thousands of years of timeless culture and heritage,"" he asserted.He further stressed that India's foreign policy is guided by its civilizational ethos rather than a pursuit of dominance. ""Wherever I go, I carry with me the essence of thousands of years of Vedic tradition,"" he remarked.The conversation provided deep insights into Modi’s vision of India as a cultural and geopolitical force, rooted in its past yet shaping the future on the global stage.In a recent interview, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recounted a memorable moment with former US President Donald Trump, highlighting their mutual trust and strong bond.Reflecting on the 2019 ‘Howdy Modi’ event in Houston, Modi recalled how Trump agreed without hesitation to walk with him around the packed stadium, despite security concerns. ""His entire security detail was thrown off guard, but for me, that moment was truly touching,"" Modi said.He also drew parallels between Trump's resilience following his recent assassination attempt and his leadership style. ""Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His reflection showed his 'America First' spirit, just as I believe in Nation First.""Modi described his first meeting with Trump at the White House, emphasizing Trump's deep respect for American history. ""He personally took me on a tour, explaining historical details without any notes. It showed how much he honored the presidency,"" Modi noted.The Indian PM also mentioned that even after Trump left office, their friendship remained strong, with Trump often conveying greetings through mutual acquaintances.When asked about Trump’s remark that Modi is a “tougher and better negotiator,” the Indian leader downplayed the compliment, calling it Trump’s ""graciousness and humility.""Modi underscored the long-standing historical and cultural ties between India and China, noting that both civilizations once accounted for over half of the world’s GDP. ""For centuries, India and China have learned from each other. Our relationship should remain just as strong in the future,"" he said.Addressing border tensions, Modi acknowledged the 2020 clashes but pointed to recent progress. ""After my meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border. We are working to restore conditions to pre-2020 levels. Trust will take time, but we are committed to dialogue,"" he stated.He also stressed the need for healthy competition rather than conflict. ""The 21st century is Asia’s century. India and China should compete naturally, not confrontationally,"" he said.Modi expressed concern over escalating global tensions, including conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and US-China relations. ""Covid exposed the limitations of every nation. Instead of learning from it, the world has become more fragmented,"" he remarked.He criticized the failure of international organizations like the UN to enforce global rules. ""Institutions meant to maintain stability are losing relevance. Those who ignore laws face no consequences,"" he said.Advocating for a shift from expansionism to cooperation, Modi reiterated, ""The world is interdependent. No nation can stand alone. The only way forward is peace and development.""In the interview, PM Modi reflected on the 2002 Gujarat riots, emphasizing that India's Supreme Court had twice upheld his innocence in the case. Responding to a question on the communal violence that resulted in over 1,000 deaths, Modi outlined the volatile atmosphere in the years leading up to the riots.He cited major terrorist incidents, including the 1999 Kandahar hijacking, the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, and 9/11, as contributors to the heightened tensions in India at the time. Modi, who had just assumed the role of Gujarat Chief Minister months before the riots, stated that Gujarat had a long history of communal violence before 2002, with over 250 riots recorded.""Those who were truly responsible have faced justice from the courts,"" Modi asserted, highlighting that Gujarat has remained riot-free for 22 years since 2002. He credited his administration’s shift from ""vote-bank politics"" to a ""politics of aspiration"" for the state's transformation.Addressing criticism, Modi said he welcomes genuine critique as essential to democracy but distinguished it from ""baseless allegations."" He reiterated his commitment to serving India despite political attacks, stating, ""For a strong democracy, genuine criticism is necessary. Allegations benefit no one; they just cause unnecessary conflicts.""PM Modi highlighted that the 2024 general elections saw a record 980 million registered voters, surpassing the total population of North America and the European Union combined. Out of these, 646 million braved extreme temperatures to cast their votes, a figure double the population of the United States.“We had over a million polling booths, ensuring accessibility to every voter, no matter how remote,” Modi said. “From using helicopters to transport voting machines in the Himalayas to setting up a polling station for a single voter in Gujarat’s Gir Forest, every vote matters in India.”India's elections are not just the largest but among the most efficient, Modi noted. While many nations take months to declare results, India, with its extensive voter base and complex geography, manages to do so within a day. “The Election Commission of India has set a global standard in conducting free and fair elections, making it a case study for the world’s top universities,” he said.Modi emphasized that his governance model transcends electoral cycles, focusing on the welfare of citizens. “Trust is the cornerstone of my leadership. I revere the people as divine and work tirelessly to uphold their faith in democracy,” he remarked. He also credited the BJP’s vast network of volunteers for their dedication to public service, stating that their efforts fortify people’s trust in the party.The discussion included admiration for India's democratic spirit. “Democracy in India is not just about numbers; it’s about the passion and participation of the people,” the interviewer stated, calling it a “beautiful case study” of citizen engagement and electoral integrity.As India continues to lead as the world’s largest democracy, its electoral model stands as a testament to the power of democratic governance and public trust.Fridman, an AI researcher and popular podcaster, described the conversation as one of the most powerful of his life, calling Modi ""one of the most fascinating human beings"" he has studied.Fridman praised Modi’s leadership, describing him as a leader who has united a diverse and complex nation. ""He is respected globally, even by nations at odds with each other,"" Fridman noted, referencing Modi’s diplomatic ties with the US, China, Russia, and the Middle East.","Prime minister narendra modi spoke with ai researcher and podcaster lex fridman.

US podcaster Lex Fridman revealed that he fasted for 45 hours before his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, describing it as a way to honor the discussion and reach a ""spiritual level.""""I am fasting right now. It has been almost two days, 45 hours. Just water, no food, in honor of this conversation, just to get in the right mindset, get into the spiritual level,"" Fridman said during the interaction.PM Modi expressed surprise and gratitude, saying, ""It feels like you're fasting as a tribute of respect for me. So, I express my deepest gratitude to you for doing this."" He went on to highlight the benefits of fasting , emphasizing its role in sharpening the senses, enhancing mental clarity, and instilling discipline.The Prime Minister spoke about how fasting helps bring ""both the inner and outer self into balance,"" making the senses—especially smell, touch, and taste—more sensitive. He also shared how fasting accelerates the thinking process and fosters out-of-the-box perspectives.""Fasting is a form of self-discipline. It never slows me down; instead, I feel more energetic and work just as much, sometimes even more,"" Modi said.Modi recalled a past meeting with former US President Barack Obama at the White House, where officials were unsure how to host him during a formal dinner since he was fasting. He was eventually served a glass of hot water, leading to a humorous exchange with Obama.""When we sat down, they brought me a glass of hot water. I turned to President Obama and jokingly said, 'Look, my dinner has arrived!'"" Modi recounted. In their next meeting, Obama remembered the incident, joking that since Modi wasn’t fasting, he would have to eat ""twice as much.""","Us podcaster lex fridman fasted for 45 hours before his conversation with prime minister narendra modi.

NEW DELHI: Congress leaders have strongly criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots during his interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman, accusing him of deflecting responsibility.During the podcast, Fridman asked PM Modi about the riots, describing them as one of the most challenging periods in India’s modern history, leading to over 1,000 deaths. PM Modi, in response, placed the events in the context of a series of terrorist attacks in India and abroad, including the 1999 Kandahar hijacking, the 2001 Parliament attack, and the 9/11 attacks in the US.He argued that Gujarat had a long history of communal riots and claimed that after 2002, the state had remained peaceful for over two decades.Targeting PM Modi, Congress leader Danish Ali said that Prime Minister’s comments were an attempt to justify the riots, which he claimed reflected the failure of the then-Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led central government in handling law and order.“The way the PM has tried to justify the Godhra riots shows the failure of the Vajpayee government regarding law and order in the country. The way he talked about the Kandahar hijacking, the Parliament attack, and more, this is, in a way, a condemnation of the Vajpayee government,” Ali said.Former Uttarakhand chief minister and senior Congress leader Harish Rawat also criticised Modi, referring to Vajpayee’s well-known remark urging Modi to follow ""rajdharma"" (duty of governance).""When the Godhra incident happened and riots broke out, the scenes were gory. Finally, the PM had to ask to uphold 'rajdharma.' If anything is wrong, the leader has to take responsibility—it will always be with a leader. These words of Atalji will keep on echoing in his ears,"" Rawat said.In the podcast, PM Modi also pointed out that India’s Supreme Court had twice upheld that he had no involvement in the riots. He dismissed allegations against him as politically motivated, saying that his government had prioritised peace and development over “appeasement politics.”",Congress slams pm modi’s remarks on 2002 gujarat riots in lex fridman's podcast.

Narendra Modi: Prime Minister of India - Power, Democracy, War & Peace | Lex Fridman Podcast #460

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s much-anticipated podcast with renowned MIT scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman released on Sunday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi delved into a wide range of topics, sharing insights on his early life, journey in Himalayas, influence of RSS, and Hindu nationalism.Talking about his early life, PM Modi said, ""Looking at the world as I understand it today, I can reflect on my childhood and the unique environment I grew up in. My village had certain fascinating aspects, some of which are quite rare, even globally. ""PM Modi further said, ""Perhaps it was some divine design that led a boy born in Vadnagar to eventually make Kashi his realm of duty, living in the embrace of Mother Ganga. When I think about my family, my father, my mother, my siblings, my uncles, aunts, grandparents, we all grew up together in a small house. The place we lived was likely even smaller than where we are sitting now. There was no window, just a small door. That’s where I was born. That’s where I grew up. Now, when people talk about poverty, it’s natural to discuss it in the context of public life, and by those standards, my early life was spent in extreme poverty, but we never really felt the burden of poverty.""When Fridman asked PM Modi about some memorable moments of 2 years which he spent in Himalayas at young age, PM Modi said, "" I spent time in the Himalayas embracing the solitude of the mountains. I met many remarkable individuals along the way. Some were great ascetics, people who had renounced everything, but still my mind remained restless. Perhaps it was my age of curiosity, of wanting to learn, to understand.""He added, "" It was a new experience, a world shaped by the mountains, by ice, by the towering snow-covered peaks. But all of this played a huge role in shaping me. It strengthened me from within and enabled me to discover my inner power. Practicing meditation, waking up in the sacred pre-dawn hours, bathing in the cold, serving people with devotion and naturally tending to elderly saints became a seamless part of who I was. Once, a natural calamity struck the region, and I immediately devoted myself to helping the villagers. So, these were the saints and spiritual masters with whom I stayed from time to time. I never remained in one place for long, I kept moving, constantly wandering. That was the kind of life I lived.""PM Modi also delved into the impact of RSS and talked about Hindu nationalism. When asked about how he joined RSS, PM Modi said, ""In our village, there was a branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where we played sports and sang patriotic songs. Something about those songs touched me deeply. They stirred something inside me, and that’s how I eventually became part of the RSS.""Lex Fridman is a research scientist who also hosts his own podcast, ""Lex Fridman Podcast.""In his podcasts, several personalities from various walks of life have discussed issues ranging from complex niches to other areas of mass understanding.Notable figures include political leaders like US President Donald Trump, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentinian Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as leading personalities in their fields, such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlson, and Yuval Noah Harari.Fridman wrote on X, ""I had an epic 3-hour podcast conversation with @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India. It was one of the most powerful conversations of my life. It'll be out tomorrow.""Responding to Fridman, Prime Minister Modi called it a ""fascinating conversation"" and shared that he discussed various time periods of his life, such as his childhood days, to the years spent in the Himalayas and eventually his way into public life.""It was indeed a fascinating conversation with @lexfridman, covering diverse topics including reminiscing about my childhood, the years in the Himalayas and the journey in public life.

Narendra Modi: Prime Minister of India - Power, Democracy, War & Peace | Lex Fridman Podcast #460

PM Modi on Swami Vivekananda

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s podcast with MIT scientist and AI researcher Lex Fridman was released on Sunday.During the conversation, PM Modi spoke on various topics, including the impact of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Hindu nationalism. When asked how he joined RSS, PM Modi said, ""In our village, there was a branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where we played sports and sang patriotic songs. Something about those songs touched me deeply. They stirred something inside me, and that’s how I eventually became part of the RSS.""Speaking further the influence of RSS, PM Modi said, ""One of the core values that were instilled in us at RSS was, whatever you do, do it with a purpose. Even while studying, study with the goal of learning enough to contribute to the nation. Even when you exercise, do it with the purpose of strengthening your body to serve the nation. This is what we were taught. And today, RSS is a massive organization. It is now nearing its 100th anniversary. Such a massive volunteer organization likely doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world. Millions of people are connected to it, but understanding RSS is not that simple. One must make an effort to truly grasp the nature of its work. More than anything, the RSS provides you with a clear direction toward what can truly be called a purpose in life. Secondly, the nation is everything, and serving the people is akin to serving God.""Also read - PM Modi's podcast with Lex Fridman released: Talks about early life, journey in Himalayas, RSS, and Hindu nationalism PM Modi also said, ""Alongside education, values are prioritized, and students remain grounded, learning skills so they don’t become a burden on society. That is in every aspect of life, whether it’s women, youth, or even laborers, the RSS has played a role.""Talking further about the Sangh, PM said that he feels blessed to have gained life's purpose from such ""sacred"" organisation. ""The volunteers who come from the RSS follow their own interests, nature and inclination, and in doing so, they strengthen and promote these kinds of activities. When you observe these initiatives, you’ll see how over the past 100 years, the RSS has dedicated itself with the discipline and devotion of a seeker staying away from the glare of mainstream attention. I feel blessed to gain life’s values from such a sacred organization. Through the RSS, I found a life of purpose. Then I was fortunate to spend some time among the saints, which gave me a strong spiritual foundation. I found discipline and a life of purpose. And through the guidance of saints, I gained spiritual grounding,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi also spoke about Swami Vivekananda and his teachings. ""Wherever I go, I carry with me the essence of thousands of years of Vedic tradition, the timeless teachings of Swami Vivekananda, and the blessings, dreams, and aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians,"" he said.He also reflected on how Vivekananda inspired him. ""When I used to read about Swami Vivekananda or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, I would often wonder, ‘How did they live? How did they build such remarkable lives?’ And for that, I constantly experimented on myself. Most of my experiments were physical in nature, testing my body’s limits.""He added that his interest in Vivekananda deepened as he read more. ""One time I read about Swami Vivekananda, his mother was ill. So, he went to Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa for guidance. He would argue with him, debate with him. In his early days, he would often argue with him, questioning everything intellectually.""PM Modi added, ""The teachings of Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Vivekananda, and the service-driven philosophy of the RSS have played a crucial role in shaping me.""Lex Fridman is a research scientist and hosts the ""Lex Fridman Podcast."" His podcast features discussions with various personalities on topics ranging from complex subjects to broader social issues.Notable guests on his podcast have included political leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Argentina's Prime Minister Javier Milei, as well as business and academic figures like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Magnus Carlsen, and Yuval Noah Harari.Fridman posted on X, ""I had an epic 3-hour podcast conversation with @narendramodi, Prime Minister of India.

The BLA said the Pakistani forces ignored a 48-hour ultimatum for a prisoner exchange, resulting in the mass execution of only Pakistan security forces personnel.This is in sharp contrast to claims by the Pak army which claimed on Friday that 26 hostages were killed by the Baloch rebels who ambushed a train in Balochistan. The army acknowledged that only 18 of the slain hostages were army and paramilitary soldiers. However, this comes as no surprise, sources said, as ISI has been known to hide casualties on its side.In their statement, the BLA also acknowledged the death of 12 of its Mujahideen including five Fidayeen of the Majeed Brigade aka the suicide squad in the incident which it named as ""Operation Darra-e-Bolan "".The Baloch rebels accused the Pakistani military of attempting to misrepresent the situation and give details of its operation.""When the Zarar Company of Pakistani SSG commandos arrived to rescue the hostages locked in the bogies of the Jaffar Express, Fidayeen surrounded and attacked them fiercely.

India to step on the gas for indigenous 5th gen fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-step-on-the-gas-for-indigenous-5th-gen-fighter/articleshow/119090404.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, with a top-level committee now working to evolve a clear-cut strategy and production-cum-business model for the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA).The committee chaired by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, which includes IAF vice chief Air Marshal S P Dharkar, secretary (defence production) Sanjeev Kumar and top officials from DRDO and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), is slated to submit its report next month.This comes at a time when Pakistan is looking to acquire at least 40 J-35A stealth fifth-generation jets from China, which is now brandishing even sixth-generation prototypes.China has already deployed its fifth-generation Chengdu J-20 jets at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.Faced with this, coupled with the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas jets by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a source told TOI that the committee's aim is to ""devise how best to get AMCA from the drawing board into the air by shrinking timelines and improving efficiency, including a good workable production-cum-business model with much greater private sector participation"".The committee will also consider the plan for indigenous development of a 110 kilonewton thrust-class engine to power the 25-tonne AMCA with foreign technology collaboration. Aero-engine majors like US General Electric, French Safran and British Rolls-Royce are in the fray for this. The new panel was formed after another defence secretary-led committee chalked out a detailed roadmap for IAF's ""all-round capability enhancement"" to plug existing operational gaps in a time-bound manner. The report was presented to defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 3, as was then reported by TOI.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five prototypes of the twin-engine AMCA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore. The AMCA, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"", however, will be ready for production only by 2035 at the earliest as per existing timelines. ""It will be a challenge to compress timelines but a major effort has to be made due to IAF's expanding technological shortfalls,"" another source said, in the backdrop of IAF currently making do with just 30 fighter squadrons when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years. IAF currently plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like. While the first two squadrons will be powered by GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 kilonewton engines.In the interim, the dwindling numbers are to be progressively made up by induction of 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters (for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore) and 108 more capable Tejas Mark-2 jets .Parallelly, the long-pending project to manufacture 114 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) with foreign collaboration as reported by TOI earlier.",India plans to 'accelerate' the development and induction of its own ambitious fifth-generation stealth fighter jet.

PM on 2002: Kar sevaks' killing acted as spark in tense climate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-on-2002-kar-sevaks-killing-acted-as-spark-in-tense-climate/articleshow/119089591.cms,"Lex Friedman, Prime Minister Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi asserted that a fake narrative was spread to malign his image over the Gujarat riots in 2002, while emphasising that the burning of kar sevaks coming back from Ayodhya acted as a spark at a time when the situation was already tense because of a number of attacks carried out by Islamic terrorist groups in India as well as abroad.Talking to Lex Fridman, research scientist at MIT and a leading podcaster, Modi listed the terror attacks - hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kandahar, attacks on Red Fort and the J&K assembly, the Al Qaida strike on New York and the attack on India's Parliament in the months leading up to the Feb 2002 riots which already had public opinion in India tense and on the edge.""In such situations, a spark is enough to cause disturbance and such a situation had already built up... and then the pilgrims were killed, burnt alive, you can imagine the situation that arose, given the background,"" Modi told the famous podcaster who fasted for hours to prepare for the more than three-hour-long conversation with the PM.""Nothing untoward should have happened, true. I also wish the same,"" Modi added. He also took issue with the ""narrative"" on the 2002 riots being an unprecedented phenomenon, recalling that Gujarat's communal situation had been traditionally inflammable and minor skirmishes would set off conflagrations.He also said that while a narrative was built to damage his image, the judiciary had cleared him.The conversation saw the PM touching upon his equations with RSS by launching into fulsome praise of the Sangh. He said it was his good fortune to be part of the Sangh tradition which places patriotism and public service above everything else. He detailed the activities of different Sangh outfits, focusing on Seva Bharati, Vidya Bharati, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, ""perhaps the world's largest trade union body which unlike the Leftist ones which believe in 'workers of the world unite' subscribes to the motto 'unite the world' philosophy"".Modi also praised Mahatma Gandhi had called him ""GOAT"". ""Mahatma Gandhi wasn't just a 20th-century leader. His relevance transcends centuries. His legacy will last for centuries to come, and he remains relevant to date.""This was the second time after his speech at a Marathi literary festival in Delhi in Feb that Modi has publicly lavished praise on RSS: something which was seen through the prism of speculation about their tense ties during the Lok Sabha campaign and because of crucial decisions, like appointment of a new BJP chief, expected shortly.Modi said RSS teaches that the country is supreme and serving people is like serving God, adding that the organisation gave him a ""purpose"" in life. ""I feel blessed to have got values from such a sacred organisation,"" he said.Asked about the Department of Government Efficiency US President Donald Trump has launched under Elon Musk, Modi said while the initiative has been talked about, he had also tried to improve efficiency in govt and make it more responsive since taking over in 2014. He mentioned the removal of ghost beneficiaries of development schemes, elimination of middlemen and launch of DBT and said it had resulted in saving of Rs 3 lakh crore.","Pm narendra modi spoke to lex fridman, research scientist at mit and a leading podcaster.

China's rise hampers India's effort to be leader of Global South: Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinas-rise-hampers-indias-effort-to-be-leader-of-global-south-army-chief-gen-upendra-dwivedi/articleshow/119088613.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Sunday highlighted the challenges posed by China's rise as a dominant economic and strategic force, stating that it hampers India’s ability to position itself as the natural leader of the Global South.Speaking at the fourth General Bipin Rawat Memorial Lecture in Delhi, General Dwivedi pointed out the increasing competition and complexity created by China's expanding influence. He suggested that India should explore opportunities in Africa, recognising it as a potential power centre in the evolving geopolitical landscape.“The rise of China as a dominant economic and strategic force adds complexity, creates competition, and hampers India's effort to be the natural leader for the Global South,” he said.Discussing India’s global standing, General Dwivedi noted the obstacles the country faces in influencing key international decisions despite its demographic and strategic advantages.“With the democratic shift and resource control race, we need to look at possibilities of Africa as a future power centre... India’s position will remain pivotal due to its geography, demography, democracy, prosperity, soft power, and inclusive approach... India, despite having the largest population, largest democracy, 7th largest land mass, and a geostrategic location, continues to remain at a relatively lower global standing,” he stated.He also pointed to international roadblocks that have limited India’s influence, referencing setbacks faced by BRICS and the resistance from the Trump administration towards its financial initiatives. “We have been repeatedly blocked, leaving us with little ability to shape key international decisions directly. Even BRICS has faced setbacks... Its purported attempt to upend the mighty US dollar has invited an open pushback from the Trump administration. In light of the same, we need to closely watch SCO ( Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ),” he said.Emphasising the role of emerging technologies in national security, General Dwivedi underscored the need for technological advancements to enhance India's strategic deterrence.“Security is about wholesome capability to wage war and deter war. Healthy military-civil fusion, Aatm Nirbhar defence industrial base, dual-use assets at the national level, well-informed and empowered decision-makers of time framework, and inclusive approach for citizen warriors play a pivotal role,” he said.“Technology prowess has become the new currency of deterrence. Data has become the new capital of trade and security,” he added.He also spoke about the significance of anti-colonial alliances in shaping a stable global order. “I imagine what Gen Rawat would have said had he been required to give us some guidelines on the envisaged role of India in the emerging security paradigm in the centrality of security forces, anti-colonial allies champion multi-world order and bandwagoning of nations helps prevent conflict. Thus, be a part of all frameworks like SCO, BRICS, BIMSTEC, Indian Ocean Regional Association, etc,” he said.General Dwivedi called for India to strengthen its role in global governance, advocating for reforms in the United Nations Security Council and greater involvement in international conflict resolution.“Reform the UN Security Council to include global South representatives. Play an active role in conflict resolution as a negotiator or a mediator. Harness the positive strength of the Indian diaspora the world over for humanitarian causes. Share a common platform for global commerce, enable the emergence of the global South, be the leader in sharing additional resources with the have-nots for better socioeconomic development,” he said.He also stressed India’s leadership in peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism efforts, reaffirming the military’s alignment with national priorities.“Lead peacekeeping operations, advocate nuclear weapons as a political asset only for deterrent purposes as long as possible, lead GWOT ( Global War on Terrorism ) by virtue of facing it firsthand in J&K, the northeast, and against left-wing extremism; I would like to assure you that the Indian Army remains aligned and integrated with the nation,” he added.","Indian army chief general upendra dwivedi highlighted the challenges posed by china's rise as a dominant economic and strategic force.
