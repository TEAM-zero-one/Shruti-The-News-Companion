India and

Australia

are fast turning into indispensable partners in the Indo-Pacific, buoyed not just by the success of the Quad grouping but also increasing cooperation in areas like education, defence, people-to-people contact and trade. Australian High Commissioner

Philip Green

sat down for a roundtable with TOI editors on a range of issues, including the return of Donald

Trump

as US prez. Edited excerpts:

Students staying back, and undocumented people

Skilled migration

Australian universities in India and mutual recognition of degrees

Bilateral ties

Scope of a full trade pact

Anti-India extremists in Australia

Adani’s Australia coal project

Trump’s treatment of allies

Future of Quad

Anti-India extremists in Australia

The Australian government and people are very unsympathetic to people who want to arrive without documentation. We have made a huge effort over the last 10 years to virtually remove that as a possibility and... that has helped undergird the support for the regular migration programme.The Australian High Commission in New Delhi is the largest offshore visa processing unit worldwide. We issued halfa-million visas last year [including] about 50,000 students, and about 1,00,000 people for skilled migration. Australia has retained for India the right of people to remain after their study. The length of stay for Indian nationals, as agreed in the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, is as follows:●Bachelor’s degree (including honours) – 2 years●Bachelor’s degree (with first class honours in STEM, including ICT) – 3 years●Master’s (coursework, extended and research) – 3 years●PhD – 4 yearsThe flow of migration between India and Australia continues at a good rate and is very much supported in our society. But there are some areas where, frankly, I’d like to see more. I’d like to make it easier for Indian nurses and other healthcare professionals to make their way to Australia. That’s an area where we have a deficit and you have something of a surfeit.The way in which we think about it is that we have global rules which allow for people to migrate on the basis of skills. Indians tend, more than others, to meet those criteria.Two foreign universities have opened a branch in India and they are both Australian — Wollongong and Deakin . They’re both more than fully subscribed. One more Australian university, University of Western Sydney, has announced that it will open a campus here in Noida. I’m very confident that we will be announcing more Australian universities opening campuses in India before too long.On recognition of degrees, that’s a university-to-university province. And it would not be normal for one university to recognise a whole slate of degrees from another university. What is really good is what is called articulation, when typically somebody does a year or two here in India and then transfers and does a year or two in Australia and gets a degree from both of those universities together. And I think that’s where the future lies.I came here with a mandate from our PM to drive [our relationship] as far and fast as we possibly could. And we’ve had good progress over a year and a bit that I’ve been here. From our perspective, there are three fundamental drivers behind this bilateral relationship: the first is strategic alignment. We see India as indispensable to framing a balance in our region that is sustainable.The second is our economic complementarity. India is the fastest growing big economy in the world. We confidently predict it’ll be the third biggest economy by 2030. [That’s] of particular interest to us... because we’re neighbours [and also] a highly complementary economy. We naturally produce the sort of things that India will need for the next generation of its growth. Energy is obvious. Minerals, especially critical minerals, and skills and training.You will have seen how successful we have been in attracting students from all around the world. And Indians particularly. Now, over 1,30,000 Indians are studying in Australia.The third driver of our relationship is what we describe as a human bridge. The fact that there are now a million people of Indian origin who live in Australia. We’ve only got 26 million on the continent. It’s the fastest-growing ethnic group in Australia. Indian languages are the fastest-growing language group in Australia.The first phase of our trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase. Part of that would be in order to strengthen the supply chain in important inputs like critical minerals... and encourage our investors and yours to take a bigger interest in each other’s countries. A part of that would be for us to be able to provide a greater degree of cooperation with the Indian agriculture sector.Australia is a democracy and we take the right of peaceful protest very seriously. And people who live in our country are entitled to take their views to the public domain so long as, and only so long as, that doesn’t involve violence or some form of intimidation of other communities. The bit of it that I’m most closely involved in is the protection of Indian diplomatic and consular agents and their premises... and I am confident that our agencies are doing a really good job.The coal project is doing fine for us. It’s producing coal that’s being shipped to India. My dealings with the group have been very largely in the field of renewable energy. We want people to take an interest in our renewable sector. We have a target of 82% of our grid being green just by 2030. That’s up from about 35% just at the start of this govt. Investors from around the world are looking at Australia as an opportunity.I don’t see evidence of the US turning inward. PM Modi was the fourth major leader and there are many others who’ve made their way to the US in the few weeks since President Trump was inaugurated. It was evident President Trump was going to bring a different sort of character to his domestic and international dealings. And that’s the way it is.Our focus is on the Quad continuing to signal that these four democracies [Australia, India, Japan, US] are prepared to expend substantial effort to maintain an order in our region which is free and open and prosperous and resilient. Areas where we will be as active or more active in the future will include maritime domain awareness, critical technology and, particularly, undersea cables, and in fields like responding to humanitarian and other disasters in the region.trade agreement is going very well and that has given us greater reason to want to conclude a second phase.

India looks to formalise defence cooperation with EU in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-looks-to-formalise-defence-ties-with-eu-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/118609765.cms,"While PM Narendra Modi and visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will look to boost ongoing efforts for an India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), both sides are also likely to discuss ways to formalise defence and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This is of particular interest to India as it encourages the EU to become more involved in the region, in favour of freedom, transparency and a rules-based order.As the EU leader landed Thursday, describing India as a friend and a strategic ally, government sources here said the visit had been in the works for the past 6 months, or since both leaders were re-elected last year, and has nothing to do with the EU’s strained alliance with the US under President Donald Trump. On her third visit to India, von der Leyen is accompanied by the EU College of Commissioners.According to Indian authorities, the visit will see significant progress in efforts to ramp up cooperation in areas like technology, particularly AI, green energy, space and defence, even if no major agreement is signed after the meeting that will be followed by a joint statement. Modi’s engagement with von der Leyen and the second meeting of the India-EU Trade and Technology Council during the visit is expected to clear the path for the India-EU summit later this year.Ahead of the talks, official sources here said the EU is showing interest in defence cooperation with India in the Indo-Pacific and the 2 sides have had “informal coordination” between their forces so far. “We might have discussions to formalise this cooperation,’’ said a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity. EU adopted an Indo-Pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region, but it’s often seen as lacking coherence.Significantly though, in 2023, it appointed a military adviser in India for the first time. According to the Indian government, India and EU are strengthening their defence cooperation under the EU co-funded Enhancing Security Cooperation In and With Asia (ESIWA) programme and it’s expected to come up for further discussions on Friday. They have also conducted joint naval exercise in the past, like in the Gulf of Guinea in 2023In an interview to TOI ahead of her arrival, von der Leyen sought a reinforcement of the EU’s defence and security cooperation with India, saying it will work with India and other countries to uphold the rules-based order in the region. While discussing Europe’s focus on Ukraine, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has on several occasions accused the West of looking the other way when the same order was under stress in the Indo-Pacific.Modi and von der Leyen will also discuss recent developments related to Ukraine, particularly Trump’s talks with Russia to end the war in which he didn’t involve either Europe or Ukraine. The EU leader is expected to engage India on the issue, while briefing Modi about her visit to Kyiv this week, Indian officials here reiterated India’s position: both parties must resort to dialogue and diplomacy as no solution can be found on the battlefield.On Friday, the 2 sides will have a plenary session that will be chaired by von der Leyen and Modi, while the College Members will also meet their counterparts individually. According to the EU, India is its largest trading partner, with trade in goods valued at €124 billion in 2023.","Eu adopted an indo-pacific strategy in 2021, and has since worked to enhance its engagement with like-minded countries in the region.

"In North India, short winter doesn't always lead to searing summer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-north-india-short-winter-doesnt-always-lead-to-searing-summer/articleshow/118612415.cms,"Representative image

Does an early end to winter imply that summer is likely to be a scorcher? TOI analysed 54-year temperature data for north India to find that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of April.

NEW DELHI: Winter has ended early in north India and February in Delhi is set to be among the three warmest in the last 15 years. So, does the early conclusion of winter indicate a long and scorching summer ahead? Contrary to the general view, data from past years shows that a warm Feb doesn't necessarily lead to a searing summer in north India.TOI analysed monthly average maximum temperatures in north India since 1971 and picked the 10 warmest months of Feb during this period. In five of these years, the corresponding months of April were indeed warmer or significantly warmer than normal but in the other five, April temperatures were either close to normal (four years) or below normal (one year).These two months were chosen for the analysis because Feb is the last month of winter in north India, while April marks the beginning of full-blown summer conditions in the region. March is usually a month of transition.""There is no direct one-to-one relationship between temperatures in Feb and April. Temperatures in these two months depend on multiple factors, including largescale signals such as presence of El Nino (or La Nina) and synoptic features such as the frequency, intensity and duration of western disturbances,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general of India Meteorological Department Trends in recent years exemplify the absence of a link between temperatures in Feb and April. In 2023, north India experienced record heat in Feb but April was cooler than normal. Feb that year was the warmest since 1901, with the average maximum temperature 3.5 degrees above the mean during 1971-2024.However, April that year turned out to be the coolest in eight years, with average maximum temperatures nearly 1 degree below the mean during 1971-2024.The reverse happened in 2022. April of that year in north India was the hottest on record, while temperatures in Feb were close to normal.""In the years when a strong El Nino (or La Nina) prevails, there can be a link between temperatures in the two months. This year, however, we have a weak La Nina that's not expected to influence temperatures,"" Mohapatra said.Another factor that's increasingly playing a role in making both months hotter in general is climate change. ""The past couple of decades have been the warmest on record. So, because of climate change, the probability of any month being warmer than in the past is high,"" said the chief of IMD, which is scheduled to release its forecast for the months of March, April and May soon.","Toi analysed 54-year temperature data for north india to find that a warm feb doesn't necessarily lead to a hotter than usual month of april. In five of these years, the corresponding months of april were indeed warmer or significantly warmer than normal but in the other five, april temperatures were either close to normal or below normal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118612493,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-278136,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'Failed state thriving on instability and handouts': India slams Pakistan at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/failed-state-thriving-on-instability-and-handouts-india-slams-pakistan-at-un/articleshow/118589983.cms,"India's Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva, Kshitij Tyagi

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday strongly criticised Pakistan at the 58th Session of the UN human rights council, calling it a ""failed state that thrives on instability and survives on international handouts.""Indian diplomat Kshitij Tyagi delivered a scathing response, accusing Pakistan of spreading falsehoods and using the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) as a ""mouthpiece"" to push its agenda against India.""It is regrettable to see Pakistan's leaders and delegates continuing to spread falsehoods handed down by its military-terrorist complex. Pakistan is making a mockery of the OIC by abusing it as its mouthpiece. It is unfortunate that this Council's time continues to be wasted by a failed state which thrives on instability and survives on international handouts. Its rhetoric reeks of hypocrisy, its actions of inhumanity, and its governance of incompetence. India remains focused on democracy, progress, and ensuring dignity for its people. Values that Pakistan would do well to learn from,"" Tyagi said.Also read: 'Committed firmly to shield human rights,' EAM S Jaishankar tells UN Tyagi further lambasted Pakistan for its continued focus on Kashmir, saying that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh would always remain an integral part of India. He pointed to the region's significant political, social, and economic progress in recent years, contrasting it with Pakistan’s internal turmoil.""The Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India. The unprecedented political, social, and economic progress in J&K in the past few years speaks for itself. These successes are a testament to the people's trust in the government's commitment to bring normalcy to a region scarred by decades of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism,"" he said.Highlighting Pakistan’s alleged human rights abuses and its harbouring of UN-sanctioned terrorists, Tyagi said, ""As a country where human rights abuses, persecution of minorities, and systematic erosion of democratic values constitute state policies, and which brazenly harbours UN-sanctioned terrorists, Pakistan is in no position to lecture anyone.""Tyagi's remarks were made in response to Pakistan's ""baseless and malicious references"" regarding Kashmir. He urged Islamabad to focus on addressing its internal governance failures rather than fixating on India.""Instead of its unhealthy obsession with India, Pakistan should focus on providing actual governance and justice to its own people,"" he said.His remarks echo India's consistent stance on the Kashmir issue . India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, had recently reaffirmed that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India while condemning Pakistan's misinformation campaigns at the UN Security Council.","India on thursday strongly criticised pakistan at the 58th session of the un human rights council.

What’s done (by home minister Amit Shah) in in some way is a reflection what Sardar Patel did at that time…once again stitching the nation together,” he said while addressing the large crowds gathered for the Mahashivratri celebrations organised by the Isha Foundation here here.Recalling the blasts that took place “every month” in the country until over a decade ago — rocking a new venue each time, be it Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune — Sadhguru said in the last 10 years, “thanks to the agencies, forces, and above all the one who leads them — our beloved home minister — and the determined hand with which he has handled all this, this is not like the country where militancy ruled; it is now largely in control”. ““He has made a promise that by 2026, militancy (Left wing extremism) will be completely eliminated,” he added.Terming as “fantastic” the decision to abrogate Article 370 in Kashmir, restore peace and make the security situation in the UT almost normal, “with lakhs of tourist coming in”, Sadhguru said economic development, education, technology and spirituality tend to go waste if basics like law and order and geographical sovereignty of the country are not maintained.“This is a very thankless job. Everybody thinks that you are (acting) hard..but there is no soft way of doing this, as I see it. It is a great mission that he (Shah) has taken up.

Airports have become the hubs of global connectivity as hubs of enabling travel across nations and cities. With the aviation industry recovering from losses over the past few years, these airports are more crucial than ever to enable easy transit for millions of people. This has enabled more individuals to travel around the world easily, cementing global relations and economic unions.In 2025, the busiest airports in the world will continue to be centers of global air travel, with millions of passengers going through them every year. The airports continue to be centers of international transit points for flights as well as reflect increasing demand for air transport globally. Among the busiest airports in the world, India's airport has improved its ranking greatly, reflecting its increasing place in the global chain of aviation. As passenger traffic between the regions, busiest airport rankings are beacons for market leaders, such as India's airport at position one in 2025.Below is the list ranking the busiest airports in the world 2025 according to available seat capacity (domestic and international) as per recent OAG report:United Arab Emirates' Dubai International (DXB) has a 4,782,140-seat capacity airport as per OAG reports and is the largest seat capacity airport in the world. Dubai International is an international air hub also, servicing mostly Emirates Airlines' long-haul flights operations, linking people to European, Asian, American, and African destinations. Dubai International Airport is renowned for its first-class facilities and with high utilization, and much of that is to international utilization in accordance with its position as an emergent principal international transit hub.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (ATL) in the United States of America, with 4,568,544 seats, is the world's busiest airport by traffic as per reports. ATL is a focus city airport for Delta Air Lines and accommodates an enormous number of domestic and international flights. ATL's huge seat capacity reflects the extent of its network as it has flights to almost every part of the world. It is in the southeastern region of the United States and as a big domestic hub plays an important role in its seat capacity.Tokyo International (HND), or Haneda Airport in Japan, has 4,222,709 seats. Tokyo's international airport or Haneda is being used due to its proximity to the center of Tokyo and is among the flagship bases for Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways (ANA). The giant seat capacity at this airport showcases its significance within domestic and international air travel.Shanghai Pudong International (PVG) in China, with 3,993,388 seats, is Shanghai's busiest airport and one of the world's leading international hubs. It is a gateway between China and Europe, North America, and other areas of Asia. It is particularly vital to one of China's biggest airlines, China Eastern Airlines. PVG has seen explosive capacity growth as a gateway to China and capacity, much like Shanghai's as an international business and financial center.London Heathrow (LHR) in the UK is a seat capacity of 3,857,036. The UK's busiest airport and one of Europe's busiest airports. British Airways operate it as a major hub and have an enormous network of foreign routes of flights. Strategically located between Europe and the other continents and having a broad network of routes are characteristics that enable it to have enormous seat capacity. Heathrow is vital in serving passengers to destinations all over the globe, particularly in Europe and North America.United States' busiest and largest, Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) with 3,686,564 seats, is also an American Airlines hub with heavy traffic from the airport within and beyond the surrounding region. The fact that the airport is located in Texas, a large geographical location both for domestic flight in the United States and international routes to Europe, Latin America, and Asia, explains the large seat capacity of the airport.Istanbul Airport (IST) in Turkey holds 3.616.029 seats and is a rapidly rising hub for intercontinental flights. It serves as the primary operating hub of Turkish Airlines with flights to most key destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa. IST did not exist when it first opened its doors in 2018, but it grew progressively more popularity at lightning speed because it lies conveniently midway between East and West and can serve nicely as a way station for transcontinental flights.Delhi Indira Gandhi International (DEL) is India's busiest airport with 3,613,762 seats, one of South Asia's international air traffic hubs of primary importance and ranks in the list of top 10 globally as reported by OAG. Delhi features various international and domestic hubs offering primary connectivity choices between the region, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. DEL is Air India and other Indian airlines' focus city of primary significance and serves to play a significant role in providing increased capacity for India's growing aviation demand.China Guangzhou Baiyun International (CAN) with 3,613,684 seats is a key airport in south China. It is the hub for China Southern Airlines, one of China's largest airlines, and has flights to key cities in Asia, Europe, and the United States. The airport is located in Guangzhou, which is one of China's leading business and manufacturing hubs, adding validity to its high seat capacity since it serves international passengers and increases Chinese tourist traffic.Beijing Capital International (PEK) in China, with 3,534,883 seats, is the busiest airport in China and among the biggest in the world.

BISHKEK: Kyrgyzstan announced Thursday it would exchange territories disputed with Tajikistan since the fall of the Soviet Union, ending a decades-long spat between the Central Asian neighbours.The border between the two countries has seen sporadic deadly clashes since both became independent in 1991, with the neighbours fighting over access to water and resources in the remote region.Both sides announced a border demarcation deal last December, but neither had detailed territorial concessions until now.Under the deal, Kyrgyzstan will receive around 25 square kilometres (10 square miles) from Tajikistan in exchange for land and better access to shared water resources, according to the head of Kyrgyzstan's secret service Kamchybek Tashiev.""Negotiations have reached the final point and can be discussed openly from today,"" Tashiev told the Kyrgyz parliament.""After parliamentary consideration, the presidents will sign, then ratification, and finally, the final version will be signed by the heads of two states. And a treaty will be drawn up between the two countries.""Several controversial roads will be declared neutral and be used by both parties under the agreement, while the two will ease access to oil wells, Tashiev said.The authorities will also relocate the inhabitants of the villages exchanged under the agreement, some of which will be destroyed and rebuilt, he added.The two countries also reached an agreement on easing access to a zone around a canal vital for agriculture, an important industry in both countries.The border dispute stemmed from Soviet times, when a simple administrative demarcation was drawn between the mountainous neighbours.Autumn 2022 saw the worst fighting over the border since the fall of the Soviet Union, with dozens killed and thousands fleeing their homes in frontier villages.The deal comes amid a general warming of relations between the five ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, which also include Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov and his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon had discussed border issues in a rare meeting at a UN summit in 2023, sparking optimism that a deal was possible.","Kyrgyzstan to exchange territories disputed with tajikistan since the fall of the soviet union.

FBI pledges full transparency



Epstein’s past and upcoming auctions of documents

The Justice Department on Thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including his contact list, flight logs, and evidence gathered against him. However, the approximately 200-page document did not reveal any major new details, largely reaffirming previous reports about Epstein’s high-profile associations.Among the names found in the contact list released by the DOJ were Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, actor Alec Baldwin, pop star Michael Jackson, Ethel Kennedy—mother of Robert F Kennedy Jr, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, supermodel Naomi Campbell, and musician Courtney Love. Others listed included Bob Weinstein, brother of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein; billionaire David Koch; late Sen. Ted Kennedy; actor Ralph Fiennes; lawyer Alan Dershowitz; former Secretary of State John Kerry; actor Dustin Hoffman; businessman Jon Huntsman; Ivana and Ivanka Trump; and model Liz Hurley. The list was redacted to remove personal contact details.While the document release provided insight into Epstein’s network, it was not a “client list” and did not confirm any direct involvement of the listed individuals in illegal activities. The DOJ also included a redacted list of 254 masseuses, blacking out their names as they were considered victims. Additionally, the binder contained flight logs from Epstein’s private jet, the “Lolita Express,” which had previously been made public with redactions.The release, described as ""Phase One,"" was met with frustration by those expecting significant revelations. Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, who was given early access to the documents, told followers in a livestream, “We’re all waiting for bombshells… and that’s not what’s in this binder at all.”Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, also criticised the release. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” she tweeted.Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that a witness informed her the FBI's New York field office had demanded access to additional materials. She has given the FBI a deadline of Friday to provide the outstanding documents.FBI director Kash Patel assured the public that there would be “no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left unturned.” He vowed that if any records had been concealed, they would be uncovered and transparently shared with the DOJ.Epstein’s “little black book” had previously surfaced in legal proceedings and was made public in 2015. That version, dated 2004-2005, included names such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Prince Andrew, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, singer Jimmy Buffet, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. A separate 1990s-era book later surfaced, containing 349 names, including figures not in the 2015 version, such as President Trump, billionaire Carl Icahn, and former New Republic publisher Marty Peretz.Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to child prostitution charges in Florida and served a 13-month sentence under a controversial work-release arrangement.A copy of Epstein’s 1990s contact book was discovered on Fifth Avenue in New York and later sold on eBay for $425. The buyer, Vermont social studies teacher Christopher Helali, now plans to auction it in March, expecting it to fetch up to $50,000.It remains unclear whether additional Epstein-related files will be released, but the naming of the binder as “Phase One” suggests more disclosures could follow.","The justice department on thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein.

BERLIN: Three mainstream political parties in Austria said Thursday that they had reached an agreement to form a new government that excludes the far right, ending five months of roller-coaster negotiations after an election last fall.It was an improbable comeback for a diverse political coalition that was tripped up by policy infighting when it tried and failed to form a government earlier this year.And it was a bitter setback for the Freedom Party, which finished first in last year's elections on the strength of an anti-establishment, anti-immigrant campaign and was briefly on the cusp of giving Austria its first far-right chancellor in the postwar era. No party came near winning a majority of votes or seats in parliament.The likely new chancellor, Christian Stocker , will instead come from the center-right party that has led the nation for most of the last seven years: the People's Party , which finished second in the September elections, as voters punished it for a string of corruption scandals that mostly occurred years ago.Stocker is set to lead the first three-party coalition in an Austrian government, alongside the Austrian Social Democrats and the centrist NEOS party. The coalition will announce ministerial appointments Friday.The announcement freezes out the Freedom Party, founded by former Nazi soldiers in the 1950s, which failed in its own attempt to form a government earlier this year.The new government will start on thin ice. The Freedom Party has only grown more popular since last fall and is now backed by a third of the country.Polls show Austrians remain frustrated about an economy that has spent the last two years in recession and worried about immigration to the country, particularly from predominantly Muslim countries. The Freedom Party made both a central issue in its last campaign, promising widespread deportations and a ban on political forms of Islam.In a nod to those issues, the new government said it would toughen its stance on migration by not allowing asylum-seekers to bring their families, while banning headscarves for girls younger than 18.""We are honest: These are going to be hard years, two hard years,"" said Beate Meinl-Reisinger, the head of NEOS. ""We are in a difficult economic situation; we are in a difficult budgetary situation,"" she said.","Three mainstream political parties in austria say they have reached an agreement to form a new government.

RIO DE JANEIRO: For a man charged with masterminding an attempted coup and banned from public office, Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.As he sees it, if US President Donald Trump could overcome crushing legal woes to make his way back into power, why can't he?""I am calm... I don't give a damn about prison,"" Bolsonaro, 69, said last week after being charged for allegedly plotting to oust President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after 2022 elections.Buoyed by the global strengthening of the far-right, Bolsonaro is lobbying for Trump to turn up the pressure on Brazilian authorities to halt what he terms legal persecution against him.The firebrand conservative has expressed confidence that Trump would use his influence to intervene on his behalf.""He won't accept that certain people around the world persecute their opponents,"" he told reporters in January.Trump has said the two men are ""great friends"" and described Bolsonaro as a ""great gentleman"" at last week's annual conservative convention in the US.Bolsonaro is awaiting a Supreme Court decision on whether to try him over the alleged coup plot -- charges which carry a jail term of up to 40 years.He is also trying to get Congress to reduce his ban on running for office until 2030, imposed over his repeated attacks on Brazil's voting system.- US targets powerful Brazilian judge -Political analyst Guilherme Casaroes of the Getulio Vargas Foundation said Bolsonaro's hopes of being able to run again ""sound far-fetched at this point.""Nevertheless, ""there are ways through which the Trump administration might try and exert some pressure on the Brazilian authorities,"" such as sanctions.The main target appears to be powerful Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes , who is leading the case against Bolsonaro.Moraes is also spearheading a crackdown on online disinformation which has put him in the crosshairs of Trump's right-hand man and X social network owner Elon Musk.The judge has ordered the suspension of social media accounts accused of spreading hate speech on X and the conservative Rumble video outlet.Last week he suspended Rumble in Brazil, after shutting X down for 40 days last year for failing to comply with court orders.The US State Department warned on X this week that his actions were ""incompatible with democratic values, including freedom of expression.""Brazil hit back, rejecting ""any attempt to politicize judicial decisions.""Bolsonaro's son, the lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, has made several trips to the US to plead his father's case to Republicans and push for sanctions against Moraes.On Wednesday, a US judicial committee approved a bill it said was inspired by Moraes, that could block foreign officials from the United States if they try and censor local companies.- Rising from the ashes? -Despite the campaign against Brazil in the US, Lucas Leite, an international relations professor at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation in Sao Paulo, believes it will be more difficult for Bolsonaro to make a comeback than Trump.Bolsonaro ""should be much more concerned"" than he appears, he said.""The only way for him to really escape would be through an amnesty via Congress, some political pact between the main parties, but I very much doubt that will happen.""I think it is very likely that he will be convicted before 2026,"" so as not to ""contaminate"" the electoral race, he added.When Bolsonaro came to power in 2019, two years after Trump, his bombastic rhetoric and style saw him dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics.""Bolsonaro has doubled down on the comparison in recent weeks, regularly comparing his knifing at a 2018 campaign rally to Trump's brush with assassination, when a bullet nicked his ear.He also recalls how both their supporters stormed government buildings two years apart in indignation over what they saw as stolen elections.""Bolsonaro is trying to reinforce this political, nationalist identity, this rhetoric that is very Trumpist and that mobilizes people very strongly,"" said Leite.His supporters are optimistic.""Trump returned to power, rose from the ashes like a Phoenix, so I believe that Bolsonaro, even with all this persecution, will also return to power in 2026,"" seamstress and Bolsonaro supporter Silvia Lucia Soares, 61, told AFP.",Brazil's far-right former president jair bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.

BRUSSELS: The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.The tit-for-tat dispute following the comments of Trump, which were aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner, further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that ""the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it,"" adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.""The EU wasn't formed to screw anyone,"" Tusk said in an X post. ""Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.""European Parliament President Roberta Metsola was in Washington, where she told an audience at Johns Hopkins University on Thursday that ""we are not out to screw anyone,"" adding that both sides should be ""pulling ourselves up together rather than the opposite.""And Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez added fiery fuel to the debate.""We are going to defend our interests when our economies are attacked with tariffs that are completely unjustified and represent a veiled threat to our economic sovereignty.""We are committed and prepared to do so,"" he said in northern Spain.The EU also warned that the moment that tariffs are announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.""The European Union and its member states have been working for months and we are going to adopt measures that are proportional to the challenge,"" Sanchez said.Metsola said that the EU would stand up to the Trump administration if tariffs are announced.""We are very ready for anything. So allow me to be clear: The EU will react firmly and immediately,"" she said. ""We don't want to go down that road - let me be clear - but we are ready.""Trump said in comments late Wednesday that the United States stood equally ready for a standoff.""We are the pot of gold. We're the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey. We don't buy any more. And if that happens, we win.""The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. Trump has complained about a trade deficit, but while the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, the EU says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.The figures are so big that it remained essential to avoid a trade war, the EU has said.""We should be talking about trade agreements rather than tariffs,"" Metsola said.","U.s. president donald trump said the european union was out to get the united states.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday vowed an ""immediate and extremely strong response"" to the US President Donald Trump 's imposition of ""unjustified tariffs"" on Ottawa.Amid Trump's crackdown on illicit drugs allegedly coming from Canada, Trudeau said his government would do everything required to avoid tariffs.""We will continue to do that work and do everything necessary to avoid these tariffs coming in, but like I said, if on Tuesday there are unjustified tariffs brought in on Canada, we will have an immediate and extremely strong response, as Canadians expect,"" Trudeau was quoted as saying by CBC News.Further, Trudeau added that, ""the first thing on tariffs is to emphasise that our government, and indeed all of Team Canada, premiers, business leaders, community leaders, are focused on one thing, making sure that come Tuesday and for the weeks that follow, there are no tariffs imposed on Canada.""""The tariffs that the president speaks of for next week are centered around the fentanyl crisis that they're facing in the United States, but that we are also facing in Canada,"" he added.The Canadian PM also addressed concerns regarding fentanyl trafficking into the United States, saying ""less than one per cent of the fentanyl that arrives in the United States comes from Canada"".""And for months now, I've been emphasising that less than one per cent of the fentanyl that arrives in the United States comes from Canada. But we know that even that one per cent, or less than one per cent, should be reduced, which is why we've invested USD 1.3 billion in strengthening our border capacities with Blackhawk helicopters, with drones, with 10,000 people patrolling our borders and keeping Canadians and Americans safe.

‘Pretty sick’ information on Epstein to be released

US attorney general Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding a vast trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and is demanding their immediate release.Bondi has revealed that “thousands of pages” from the FBI’s investigation into the convicted sex offender and pedophile were missing from the files handed over to her office, the New York Post reports.In a letter to FBI director Kash Patel, Bondi insisted that the full and unredacted Epstein files be delivered by 8.00 am on Friday. She cited a whistleblower from the FBI’s New York office who claimed that only around 200 pages had been provided, while the majority remained hidden. The batch of documents initially handed over included flight logs, phone numbers, and names of victims. However, an insider warned that hundreds more documents had not been disclosed.“By 800 am tomorrow, February 28, the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained,” Bondi wrote.“There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access,” she added, making it clear that she expects full transparency.The revelation has sparked fears that crucial evidence could be destroyed. Representative Andy Ogles has already introduced a bill aimed at preventing Epstein-related records from being erased.Ogles wrote to Bondi on Wednesday, revealing he was drafting the Preventing Epstein Documentation Obliteration Act—or the PEDO Act—to safeguard records amid “reports that certain FBI agents are allegedly attempting to destroy critical records.”“Should you encounter any statutory barriers to the expeditious public release of Jeffrey Epstein’s client list or other pertinent information related to his activities… I stand ready to assist,” he wrote.Ogles also pointed out that past government secrecy over high-profile investigations—such as those into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy—had undermined public trust.Whistleblower and former FBI special agent Garret O’Boyle recently suggested that FBI personnel were working to erase sensitive files.“There are FBI servers,” O’Boyle said in an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson. “And people inside the FBI have been working night and day to destroy files on these servers. No idea on what it is—I can only speculate—but you mentioned the Epstein list. I’d imagine it’s cases like that.”The FBI already has several Epstein files available to the public, but The New York Post reported that the department of justice was set to release 100 pages from Epstein’s personal address book on Thursday.Bondi had hinted at the impending release of more Epstein documents during an interview on Jesse Watters Primetime, saying the material the government possesses is “pretty sick” and will “make you sick.”On Thursday, conservative influencers who visited the White House were handed what was described as “Phase 1” of the Epstein files release . They left the West Wing holding binders but did not immediately disclose their contents to the press.Senator Marsha Blackburn has also demanded full disclosure of Epstein-related records.“For years, my efforts to crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open have been stonewalled by Democrats at every turn,” she posted Monday on X. “This will change under FBI Director Kash Patel. I just sent him a letter asking for the complete & unredacted Epstein files.”Patel had previously assured Blackburn during his confirmation hearing that he would “do everything” to reveal the “full weight” of Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.",Us attorney general pam bondi has accused the fbi of withholding a vast trove of documents related to jeffrey epstein and is demanding their immediate release.

The TOI correspondent from London

: Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi claims he is in a David and Goliath fight against the Bank of India who are pursuing him for $8.4 million (about Rs 73.4 crore). He says he is the underdog since he is in prison in Britain without access to a laptop or the Internet.Nirav denies he owes the bank anything and a trial to determine whether he does is scheduled at the London high court in Jan 2026.The India-born businessman (54) argued in the high court on Thursday that if the trial went ahead, it breached his rights to a fair trial as he could not conduct his defence as a litigant in person without a laptop or Internet. He also argued that if he tries to obtain documents or witness statements for his defence, he could face further criminal charges.He appeared at London circuit commercial court via video link from Thameside prison , representing himself, without a lawyer.“The bank has tanks and missiles and I only have wooden sticks,” he told the court, arguing for the case to be stayed. “My servers were taken away by the ED. I don’t have access to anything.”The Bank of India got a summary judgment of $8.4 million against Nirav’s company Firestar Diamond FZE in Dubai March 2024 for non-payment of a $15 million (approximately Rs 131 crore) loan the company took out in 2012.In 2018, at the time of Nirav’s alleged fraud against PNB, the Bank of India terminated the loan. It has not been repaid, so now the bank is pursuing Nirav who, the bank says, provided a personal guarantee.Nirav says he does not recollect signing the loan facility. He wants a forensic expert to look at the original loan documents to see if his signatures are forged, so he made an application to see the original three core contractual documents.Judge David Bailey KC adjourned his stay application until the pre-trial review in Sept and gave an order that the bank must allow him to inspect the three original documents.Bailey also ordered the bank to provide Nirav with hard copies for disclosure, a hard copy of the current edition of the CPR (civil procedure rules) and a book for litigants in person.Nirav isin custody pending extradition to India where he faces criminal proceedings . He is on remand in the UK pending the outcome of “confidential proceedings” which won’t conclude until late 2026, Bailey said.Tom Beasley, representing the Bank of India, objected to the stay saying that Nirav was able to conduct other proceedings, such as his bail applications, US bankruptcy proceedings and “trust proceedings” in the high court, as well as the “confidential proceedings”.Before the hearing, Nirav asked Beasley if the bank had been paid back as he said the ED had issued a release in Sept 2024 saying it had received “Rs 1,024 crore” which had been “given to all the banks”.Beasley said: “We have not been paid. If we had, we would not be here.”","Fugitive diamantaire nirav modi claims he is in a david and goliath fight against the bank of india who are pursuing him for $8.4 million (about rs 73.4 crore) the india-born businessman (54) argued that if the trial went ahead, it breached his rights to a fair trial as he could not conduct his defence as a litigant in person.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118611091,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-649459,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

A social media post allegedly written by Barron Trump defending Elon Musk has gone viral—but the post is fake, and the account behind it has no connection to the former president’s son.The post, widely shared on X (formerly Twitter), appeared to praise Musk’s leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a controversial task force focused on cutting government spending . The message read: ""The richest man in the world is working for free in order to stop your government from robbing you blind. Instead of complaining, why don't you sit down, shut up, and say thank you.""Screenshots of the post quickly spread across social media, with users reacting strongly—some supporting Barron's supposed stance, while others mocked him, posting comments like ""Don’t tell us what to do, Barron!""However, a closer look reveals that the post was never made by Barron Trump. Instead, it originated from an X account named ""Barron Trump News"" with the handle ""@TrumpBarronNews."" The account's bio clearly states it is not affiliated with him.Adding to the confusion, Barron Trump has no verified presence on X, and a representative for him declined to comment on the viral post .Despite being debunked, the fake post continues to circulate, fueling debate over online misinformation and the role of prominent figures in shaping public discourse.","A social media post allegedly written by barron trump defending elon musk has gone viral.
