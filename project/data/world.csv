Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s statement that Pakistan spy agency ISI had planned attacks in Kerman in Iran and Moscow’s Crocus City Hall in 2024 has validated the findings by Indian intelligence agencies that ISI and the Pakistan military were running IS-Khorasan modules from Af-Pak border areas.The two attacks, which happened in a span of three months, were claimed by the IS in Khorasan Province. Iran’s probe had revealed that the main accused Abdollah Tajiki had entered Iran two weeks before the attack by crossing the southeast border (that is Pakistan).US had called the attack in Moscow as “IS-K’s first successful attack in Russia”, though Moscow had accused “the special services of an unfriendly state” for the blast — seen as a reference to Ukraine.“Both operations — originally claimed by the Islamic State — were coordinated on Pakistani soil and IS-K’s leadership is based in Pakistan,” Mujahid claimed during a press briefing on Oct 12. The Taliban administration’s spokesman also implicated the ISI in fomenting unrest in Afghanistan, alleging that certain elements within Pakistan’s military establishment were averse to peace in the region.The Taliban’s claims corroborates the assessment of the Indian agencies that IS-K’s recruiters brainwashing Indian youths were actually being controlled by ISI. Several IS-inspired modules busted in Delhi, Ranchi and other places were being handled by ISI operatives with the internet protocol analysis pointing to locations deep inside Pakistan. “A particular group within the Pakistani army is turning a blind eye to IS activities,” Mujahid alleged. He accused Pakistan of allowing IS-K to operate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, planning attacks on Afghan soil.",Taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid said pakistan spy agency isi had planned attacks in kerman in iran and moscow’s crocus city hall in 2024.

"Asian stocks today: Markets dip after Trump's 100% tariff threat to China; HSI falls over 9%, Shenzhen down over 340 points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-stocks-today-markets-dip-after-trumps-100-tariff-threat-to-china-hsi-falls-over-9-shenzhen-down-over-340-points/articleshow/124517911.cms,"



Asian markets tumbled on Monday after US President Donald Trump escalated tensions with China, threatening last week to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.Hong Kong's HSI traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%. Shanghai and Shenzhen also dipped 1.3% and 2.56% respectively.Japan's Nikkei also traded in red, reaching 48,088, shedding 491 points or 1.01%. Kospi, too followed the downward trajectoy, falling 1.66 points to 3,550 at 10:30 AM IST.Trump had posted on social media on Friday that he would levy an additional 100% tariff on China and warned he might cancel a summit with Xi. He cited Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.The new US tariffs, along with export controls on ""any and all critical software,"" are set to take effect from November 1. Trump described Beijing’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive"" and said, ""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'.""Currently, Chinese goods face 30% US tariffs, while Beijing’s retaliatory duties stand at 10%.The announcement sent Wall Street into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq dropping more than three percent.Investors were already cautious after a recent surge in tech stocks had raised fears of a market bubble.The latest tensions came after months of fragile peace between the two economic giants, who had been negotiating a full trade deal following Trump’s tariff announcements in April. That earlier round had led to escalating tit-for-tat levies.Meanwhile, Trump’s Sunday comments gave a small boost to US futures, which rose more than one percent.Gold, often seen as a safe-haven during uncertainty, continued to climb, hitting a new record of $4,060. Oil also bounced back after Friday’s slump, which had been worsened by Trump’s remarks and eased by news of the Israel-Hamas peace deal calming supply concerns.","Hong kong's hsi traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%.

NEW DELHI: A delegation of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who left their homeland over the decades in the face of persecution and took refuge in India met Taliban foreign affairs minister Amir Khan Muttaqi at the Afghan embassy on Monday and requested that the current regime in Afghanistan facilitate a joint delegation of prominent Hindus and Sikhs leaders from India for the restoration and maintenance of historical gurdwaras and temples located there.The delegation is learnt to have also sought easing of requirements for Afghan Hindus and Sikhs who are now Indian nationals so that they can visit like before without having to apply for a visa, as many would want to go back for business if the regime there ensures safety for minorities.They also sought that the Afghanistan government (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) must consider appointing and engaging Afghan national Hindus or Sikhs in their mission in India too, as this will strengthen the bilateral relations.“As during the previous regime, minorities were given representation in the government and considering the same, at least two persons - one each from the Hindu and Sikh community should be appointed to high-ranking positions in the government,” the delegation conveyed as per a statement issued after the meeting. They also sought restoration of property rights and estate of minorities which were grabbed during the previous regime.The delegation, led by Afghan Minorities Council in coordination with the Indian World Forum, comprised around 30 prominent Hindus and Sikh members of the community who came to India over the decades and many of them now hold Indian citizenship.Indian World Forum President Puneet Chandhok said, “we hope that the present regime will ensure foolproof rights of minorities living there.”After the meeting, Guljeet Singh, a prominent voice from the community, told TOI that “The foreign minister assured us that he will take up all our concerns back home.” Singh said that there are about 5,000 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Delhi. While most have acquired Indian citizenship, there would still be around 2,000 people who are Afghan nationals.The exodus over the decades has led a large number of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus to India and from here to various other countries like the United States, Canada, UK and Germany among other countries.","Afghan hindus and sikhs meet foreign minister muttaqi at the afghan embassy.

‘Brics was an attack on dollar’: Donald Trump explains why he imposed tariffs; claims members are dropping out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brics-was-an-attack-on-dollar-donald-trump-explains-why-he-imposed-tariffs-claims-members-are-dropping-out/articleshow/124565699.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP photo)





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday detailed his tariff strategy against Brics , claiming the bloc was “against the dollar” and saying countries were “dropping out.”“I told anybody who wants to be in Brics, that's fine, but we're going to put tariffs on your nation,” Trump said. “Everybody dropped out. They're all dropping out of Brics. Brics was an attack on the dollar and I said, you want to play that game, I'm going to put tariffs on all of your products coming into the US. They said, like I said, we're dropping out of Brics...They don't even talk about it anymore.”Just days earlier, India had urged Brics nations to uphold the multilateral trading system and adhere to international law - a move seen as a pushback against the protectionist measures promoted by Trump’s MAGA-driven America. The appeal risks fresh friction with a US President increasingly vocal in his hostility towards the non-Western economic grouping.Trump has repeatedly attacked Brics in the past, portraying it as a challenge to US economic dominance. The grouping, originally formed by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has now expanded to ten full members: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE, and Indonesia.Ten others are partner states -- including Belarus, Bolivia, and Malaysia -- while another ten, such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have applied for membership.The rapid expansion of Brics has rattled Washington. Trump has cast it as a direct threat to the dollar’s global reserve status, insisting the bloc was “set up to hurt us” and to “degenerate our dollar.”Even as New Delhi clarified that it does not support de-dollarisation, Trump issued a fresh warning -- threatening a 100 percent tariff on Brics nations if they pursued that path.","Us president donald trump on wednesday detailed his tariff strategy against brics.

'US is willing to do whatever it takes'

What’s next: Trump-Xi meeting in South Korea





The US-China trade war took a sharper turn this week, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accusing Chinese President Xi Jinping’s regime of making ""provocative,"" economic moves after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earth minerals.Speaking to Fox Business on Monday, Bessent said the move was a direct challenge to the global economy, ""This is China versus the rest of the world. They announced these export controls that are going to go into effect next month, and we have aggressively pushed back against them. We're not sure where this came from, why the Chinese have decided to do it now.""He added that the US would not allow Beijing to weaponize its dominance in rare earths, that includes vital materials for industries like defense, electric vehicles, and electronics, saying, ""They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world. And, you know, we're not going to have it. China is a command and control economy. They are neither going to command [nor] control us. ""Bessent said Washington had already begun coordinating with allies, including India, Europe, and other Asian democracies, to respond collectively to China’s move.""We are going to assert our sovereignty in various ways. We have already been in touch with the allies. We will be meeting with them this week and, you know, I expect that we will get substantial global support from the Europeans, from the Indians, from the democracies in Asia,"" he added.Beijing’s new rules, announced on October 9, require companies — both Chinese and foreign — to obtain government approval to export any product containing more than 0.1% rare earth elements by value. The curbs also expand the list of restricted minerals and ban exports for foreign military use.China controls nearly 70% of the world’s rare earth mining and 90% of processing, giving it outsized leverage in sectors that depend on these materials.Among the most crucial elements is dysprosium (atomic number 66), a key ingredient in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, semiconductors, and defense systems. Bessent compared the importance of these minerals to baking powder in a bakery, ""used in small quantities, but absolutely essential.""The export controls, which Beijing said are intended to protect national security amid ""frequent military conflict,"" have rattled supply chains globally and prompted the Trump administration’s retaliatory threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting November 1.President Donald Trump escalated tensions on Friday, announcing plans to double tariffs on Chinese imports, raising the total tariff rate to around 130%.He described China’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive,"" saying the US would respond with ""strong measures to defend our industries.”However, Trump later sought to calm markets, posting on Truth Social, ""It will all be fine. President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want depression for his country, and neither do I. The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”Trump’s fluctuating stance has led some on Wall Street to dub him ""TACO""— short for ""Trump Always Chickens Out,"" due to his history of walking back tough tariff threats.Bessent further criticised Beijing’s strategy, calling it a sign of economic weakness rather than strength.In an interview with, he remarked, ""This is a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them. Maybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world. If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most.""He accused China of being ""in the midst of a recession or depression"" and trying to ""export their way out of it,"" warning that such tactics would only ""exacerbate their standing in the world.""Amid the escalating tensions, Bessent emphasised the importance of building a coordinated global response. He added that the US is ""willing to do whatever it takes ""to stabilise supply chains and negotiate a deal.""""Everything's on the table. I am optimistic that this can be de-escalated … lines of communication have been opened … But, the US will not be deterred here. And, you know, as I said, this is China versus the world. And the Chinese have a different business model than we do. But there is no business model that shows it is a good idea to harm your customers. China is the largest exporter in the world, and they are dependent on trade. We do not want to decouple. We want to de-risk,"" Bessent added.Despite the growing friction, Bessent confirmed that President Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to meet in South Korea later this month, although tensions could affect the schedule.""He will be meeting with Party Chair Xi in Korea, I believe that meeting will still go ahead,"" Bessent told Fox Business.Ahead of that meeting, US and Chinese officials are expected to hold staff-level talks in Washington during the IMF and World Bank meetings, followed by discussions between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Asia.The coming weeks will test whether both sides can de-escalate the rare earth dispute or whether it becomes another flashpoint in the world’s most consequential trade relationship.","Us treasury secretary scott bessent accuses china of making ""provocative,"" economic moves.

How DJ Moore got hurt and what happened on the field

Hospital evaluation and what the team has said

Monday night took a scary turn for Chicago Bears fans when wide receiver DJ Moore was stretchered off the field and taken to a hospital after a narrow 20-17 win over the Washington Commanders. The injury came late in the game, prompting immediate concern from fans and teammates alike. While Moore appeared to joke around in the locker room postgame, the team confirmed he would remain under precautionary medical evaluation.Details about the injury’s severity and expected recovery are still unclear, but here’s everything we know so far.The injury occurred during the fourth quarter, when Moore went in for a contested catch along the sideline. He appeared to take a hard hit to the midsection, immediately clutching his side and limping off the field. Teammates checked on him as he walked gingerly, and the Bears’ medical staff quickly signaled for a stretcher and ambulance to be called.Moore’s exit left fans panicking in the stadium and online, with many noting that he had been a key factor in keeping the Bears competitive during the tight matchup.After the game, Moore was transported to a local hospital in Washington, D.C.for further evaluation. The Bears confirmed that this was a precautionary measure, and no official diagnosis has been released. Team officials have not provided a recovery timeline or treatment plan, leaving fans and analysts waiting for more information.Sources say the hospital visit is standard procedure in such cases, especially when a player experiences a hit to the midsection that could potentially involve internal injuries. As of now, Moore is staying overnight for observation before any updates on his condition are released.Unsurprisingly, fans took to X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram to express concern. Tweets ranged from anxious “get well soon” messages to memes joking about Bears’ upcoming games without Moore. Some fans speculated about the severity of the injury, while others reminded followers to wait for verified updates rather than speculate wildly.Despite the panic, many fans also expressed relief after learning Moore was alert and joking postgame, emphasizing that this was likely a precaution rather than a critical injury.For now, DJ Moore’s condition remains under evaluation, and fans should brace for updates as more information becomes available. The Bears are keeping the details tight, emphasizing that the hospital visit is precautionary and not necessarily a sign of a severe injury.Also read - “Why she’s not hanging out with Stefon Diggs”: Cardi B’s 33rd birthday sparks major breakup rumors","Chicago bears wide receiver dj moore was stretchered off the field and taken to a hospital after a narrow 20-17 win over the washington commanders.
