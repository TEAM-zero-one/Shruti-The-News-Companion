Poll Do you think India's space program will advance significantly with missions like Axiom-4? Yes, absolutely! No, it will take time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday met Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , pilot of the Axiom-4 Space Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence. PM Modi welcomed Shukla with a warm hug and walked alongside him with his arm on the astronaut’s shoulder, highlighting the significance of the moment.During the meeting, Shukla presented the Axiom-4 mission patch to the Prime Minister and shared photographs of the Earth taken from the ISS. Shukla, who returned to India early Sunday, had received a rousing welcome at the Delhi airport.After the meeting, PM Modi took to X and posted, “Had a great interaction with Shubhanshu Shukla. We discussed a wide range of subjects including his experiences in space, progress in science & technology as well as India’s ambitious Gaganyaan mission. India is proud of his feat.”Earlier in the day, Shukla was honoured in the Lok Sabha during a special discussion celebrating his milestone mission.Shukla completed an 18-day Axiom-4 mission on July 15, conducting over 60 experiments with three other crew members aboard the ISS—a key step towards India’s human spaceflight ambitions under the Gaganyaan programme.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the special discussion in the House was aimed at celebrating Shukla’s achievements and India’s growing space capabilities.“Our hero astronaut Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla has returned home after a successful mission to the ISS. Parliament will honour him with a special discussion on his historic milestone and India’s journey towards Viksit Bharat,” Rijiju posted on X. He urged Opposition MPs to participate in the debate in the same spirit as they had during Operation Sindoor, though they chose to boycott, causing repeated disruptions.Breaking ranks, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor praised Shukla on social media. “Since the Opposition are not participating in the special discussion, let me say how proud all Indians are of the recent mission of Commander Shubhanshu Shukla to the ISS. It served as a stepping stone to our nation’s human spaceflight program, Gaganyaan,” Tharoor wrote.PM Modi had earlier lauded Shukla in his Independence Day address, reiterating India’s plan to build its own space station. ISRO Chairman V Narayanan said the first module is expected to be placed in orbit by 2028, with the station fully operational by 2035.Union MoS for science and technology Jitendra Singh criticised Opposition MPs for not acknowledging the achievement. “Your anger can be with the government and the BJP, but it is surprising you can be angry with an astronaut. He is not linked to any political party. You are angry with the earth, you are angry with the sky and today you seem to be angry with space as well,” Singh said.Shukla’s journey included nearly a year of intensive training in the US before being selected for the Axiom-4 mission. On his return, he expressed gratitude to the nation and said he would share his experiences with students and scientists across India. He is also set to attend National Space Day events later this month.","Pm narendra modi met astronaut shubhanshu shukla at his lok kalyan marg residence.

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) was signed by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru despite vehement opposition in Parliament, including by Congress MPs, BJP president JP Nadda on Monday dubbed the 1960 treaty as one of the ""biggest blunders"" of India's first prime minister.""Indus Waters Treaty, 1960 was one of the biggest blunders of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru that kept national interest at the altar of personal ambitions... he unilaterally handed over 80% of the Indus basin waters to Pakistan, leaving India with just 20% of the share,"" Nadda said in a series of posts on X.It was a decision that ""permanently compromised"" India's water security and national interest and its ""most appalling"" aspect was that ""Nehru made it without consulting the Indian Parliament"". ""The treaty was signed in Sept 1960. However, it was placed before Parliament only two months later, in Nov, and that too, for a token discussion of mere two hours!"" the BJP chief said.""Nehru yielded far too much, receiving nothing in return.

By putting Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, PM Modi has corrected yet another grave historical wrong committed by Congress!""Nadda further said that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then a young MP, had torn into Nehru's decision.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar sought a candid and constructive approach to bilateral ties, as India and China seek to move ahead after a difficult period in the relationship, in a meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. Going into the meeting with Wang, their first on Indian soil in over 3 years, the minister also said that the basis for any positive momentum in ties remains the ability to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.“It is also essential that the de-escalation process move forward,” he said, underscoring India’s position on the border issue as PM Narendra Modi prepares to visit China next week amid strong signs of a rapprochement in the relationship.Jaishankar touched upon India’s concerns about Chinese trade restrictions, cross-border terrorism and underlined the imperative in the current circumstances of maintaining and enhancing stability in the global economy, alluding in his opening remarks to worldwide unrest over continued conflicts and the US tariff rollout.Wang in his remarks spoke against “unilateral bullying"" and the threat to free trade and international order.A Chinese readout also quoted Jaishankar as saying Taiwan is a part of China, signalling India’s continued support for One-China policy even though it has stopped articulating it in bilateral documents with Beijing.“When the world’s two largest nations meet, it is natural that the international situation will be discussed. We seek a fair, balanced and multi-polar world order, including a multi-polar Asia. Reformed multilateralism is also the call of the day,” said Jaishankar, expressing hope that the talks would contribute to building a stable, cooperative and forward-looking relationship and one that served both countries’ interests and concerns.“The fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is another major priority,” he told Wang.Wang, who spoke about the need to maintain the momentum in the relationship, will hold the 24th round of Special Representatives’ talks on the boundary question with NSA Ajit Doval on Tuesday. He will also call on PM Narendra Modi after the talks with Doval.Seeking a constructive approach, Jaishankar stressed India’s position that both sides should be guided by the three mutuals - mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interest. “Differences must not become disputes, nor competition conflict,” he told Wang, echoing Modi’s statements earlier.After the meeting, Jaishankar said he had a productive conversation with Wang on economic and trade issues, pilgrimages, people-to-people contacts, river data sharing, border trade, connectivity and bilateral exchanges.In his opening remarks, Jaishankar also told Wang that he would follow up on concerns he had raised earlier. During his visit to China in July for SCO foreign ministers’ meeting, Jaishankar had flagged issues related to China’s restrictive trade practices that hurt manufacturing in India. He had also discussed Pakistan’s backing of cross-border terrorism.Wang is visiting India just before the SCO summit that China will host on September 1. Modi is expected to have bilateral meetings with both President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the margins. This will be the first visit by Modi to China in over 7 years. The visit follows the detente in ties after both sides completed the disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh and agreed to take further steps for de-escalation. Following that disengagement agreement, Modi and Xi met on the margins of the BRICS summit in Kazan in October 2024 and agreed to work towards normalising the relationship.According to the Chinese statement on the meeting, Wang stressed that China is willing to uphold the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and a shared future, and work with neighbouring countries, including India, to jointly build a ""five-home"" of peace, tranquility, prosperity, beauty and friendship. “China and India should strengthen their confidence, meet each other halfway, eliminate interference, expand cooperation, and consolidate the momentum of improvement in China-India relations,” it said.",External affairs minister s jaishankar sought a candid and constructive approach to bilateral ties with chinese counterpart wang yi.

At present, the NDA holds a numerical advantage.The combined strength of the two Houses is 786, factoring in six vacancies — one in the Lok Sabha (Basirhat, West Bengal) and five in the Rajya Sabha (four from Jammu and Kashmir and one from Punjab, where AAP MP Sanjeev Arora resigned after winning a state assembly bypoll).A candidate needs at least 394 votes to win, assuming full participation. The NDA is well placed, with 293 MPs in the 542-member Lok Sabha and 129 MPs in the 240-member Rajya Sabha (effective strength), including support from nominated members.This gives the ruling alliance an estimated total of 422 votes, comfortably above the required majority.Under Article 68(2) of the Constitution, an election to fill a vacancy in the office of the vice president due to resignation, death, removal, or any other reason must be conducted ""as soon as possible."" The elected person serves a full five-year term starting from the day of assuming office.The election is held by proportional representation through a single transferable vote and conducted by secret ballot, as stated in Article 66(1). Members rank the candidates in order of preference. The vice president is India’s second-highest constitutional authority and also functions as the ex-officio chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.Former vice-president Jagdeep Dhankhar, 74, had resigned from his post on July 21, 2025, citing health reasons. In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu posted on the vice-president's official X account, he wrote, ""To prioritise health care and abide by medical advice, I hereby resign as the Vice-President of India, effective immediately, in accordance with Article 67(a) of the Constitution.""The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the election of the vice-president of India.

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah—located along today’s Benin coast—exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.","Russell wilson's wife and grammy-winning singer ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from benin.

“Nothing like hiring a sex offender and a former drug abuser for this particular job….”

Tennis star Martina Navratilova laughed when a picture meme reminded her of something U.S. President Donald Trump said in August 2024. He said San Francisco was a great city 15 years ago. Back then, Kamala Harris was the district attorney of San Francisco and Gavin Newsom was its mayor.

Navratilova’s simple reaction was just, “lol.” This moment now stands out as an accidental compliment during their public feud.In August 2024, Trump was at the U.S.–Mexico border in Cochise County, Arizona. He was talking about San Francisco.

Fighting Game Movies Are Having a Glow-Up

The Hype Is Real

The Street Fighter movie is shaping up to be pure fan-service gold, and the latest update has fans buzzing. Cody Rhodes , WWE’s “American Nightmare,” is stepping into the role of Guile, complete with the character’s legendary flat-top haircut. Yes, that high-and-mighty military cut is officially headed to the big screen, and it’s already stealing the spotlight.Casting Cody Rhodes as Guile is kind of genius. He’s got the physique, the intensity, and that all-American soldier vibe. But Street Fighter fans weren’t going to be sold unless one detail made the cut (literally): Guile’s hair.And guess what? It’s happening. Rhodes’ silhouette on set revealed the unmistakable flat-top, and fans instantly knew that this was Guile.Guile’s haircut isn’t just a style; it’s a personality. The flat-top has been part of his identity since Street Fighter II dropped back in the ’90s. It screams discipline, attitude, and “Sonic Boom” energy.For Rhodes to pull this off, he doesn’t just have to act like Guile; he has to wear Guile. And judging by early sneak peeks, the look is locked in.The movie isn’t just banking on one good haircut. The lineup is stacked:Add Cody Rhodes as Guile to that mix, and this feels less like a video game movie and more like a WrestleMania crossover event.Rumors even have Andrew Koji and Noah Centineo playing Ryu and Ken, which would lock down the core of the franchise.Video game movies have been hit-or-miss for decades, but the tide is turning. Mortal Kombat is revving up with Karl Urban as Johnny Cage, and now Street Fighter is leaning hard into faithful fan service.Getting Guile’s hair right may seem small, but it’s the kind of detail that shows the creators get it. They’re not cutting corners; they’re giving fans the real deal.We still don’t have the full trailer or official stills, but one shadowy reveal of Rhodes’ flat-top was enough to spark memes, fan edits, and a wave of “take my money” tweets.If the rest of the movie delivers on this level of detail, Street Fighter could finally break the “curse” of video game adaptations and give fans the over-the-top action they’ve been waiting for.Cody Rhodes stepping into Guile’s boots and haircut is more than just casting news. It’s a signal. Street Fighter isn’t just reimagining its characters for Hollywood, it’s bringing them to life as faithfully as possible. And if Rhodes can nail the attitude to match that flat-top? Consider this movie a critical hit.","Wwe’s “american nightmare,” is stepping into the role of guile. Rhodes’ silhouette on set revealed the unmistakable flat-top haircut.

Connor McDavid’s new contract could reset expectations



Why Connor McDavid’s contract could shape Auston Matthews’ next deal



The NHL’s contract market is once again buzzing, and this time the focus is on Connor McDavid. A recent update from insider John Shannon suggests that the Edmonton Oilers captain’s next deal could be shorter and cheaper than many fans expected. While Oilers fans may be relieved, the news has rippling effects for Toronto, where Auston Matthews’ long-term future remains a delicate balance between health, performance, and financial strategy.Connor McDavid’s contract situation has dominated headlines for months, and while most assumed he would eventually sign a long-term extension in Edmonton, Shannon’s latest comments hint at a surprising shift. “I think it’s a…three or four year deal; I think Connor’s gonna come in lower than a lot of people are expecting; short term,” Shannon noted.This projection diverges from the expected eight-year mega-deal, fueling speculation that McDavid could prefer flexibility in his next chapter. There’s even chatter about a two-year option, which would keep his earnings high while allowing him to revisit the market when the salary cap continues to rise. For Edmonton, this provides security in the short run, but it also ensures McDavid retains leverage over his future.The bigger question, however, is what this means for Toronto.Auston Matthews, who is already the face of the Toronto Maple Leafs franchise, carries a $13.25 million cap hit under his current contract. While locked in for now, Toronto knows his future payday could dwarf McDavid’s, especially as the NHL salary cap is projected to rise significantly in the coming years. If McDavid is in the $16–$17 million range, many expect Matthews to command $20 million annually once his deal is up.But money isn’t the only factor. Toronto must weigh Matthews’ durability. There are lingering concerns about his health heading into the season, raising questions about whether the Leafs will get the full “Auston Matthews experience” when it matters most. Playoff performance, too, looms over his legacy. Despite an impressive 727 points in 629 games, his postseason struggles remain a sticking point for critics.For now, one thing is clear: Connor McDavid’s decision to prioritize short-term security over a long-term extension will likely reset the market. And when Auston Matthews’ contract comes due, Toronto may have no choice but to follow a similar playbook—big money, shorter years, and plenty of pressure to deliver when it counts.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge as Auston Matthews’ health questions emerge before opener without Mitch Marner",Auston matthews’ toronto maple leafs future thrown into spotlight after latest mcdavid contract update stirs debate.

Pop sensation Madison Beer has once again found herself at the center of attention, this time for reasons beyond music. The 26-year-old, discovered after Justin Bieber shared one of her early YouTube covers, has grown into a global star with Grammy nominations and millions of fans worldwide. Recently, she was photographed alongside Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert on the set of her upcoming music video, fueling a fresh wave of speculation.With over 40 million Instagram followers and chart-topping tracks like Reckless and Make You Mine, her influence extends far beyond the stage. Now preparing to release her third studio album, she continues to redefine her space in pop culture. The sight of Herbert, a 6-foot-6 NFL star, at her video shoot only added more intrigue, leaving fans to wonder what lies ahead.While nothing has been confirmed, this isn’t the first time Beer’s relationships have made headlines. With her career reaching new heights, interest in who Madison Beer is dating continues to be a trending topic.Madison Beer has been in the public eye since her teenage years, and along with her rise as a singer, her love life has remained a topic of fascination. From early romances that ended in heartbreak to her current relationship built on safety and trust, here’s a look back at the men she has been linked to over the years.Madison’s first high-profile relationship was with Vine star-turned-musician Jack Gilinsky. They met through mutual friends and dated for about two years. Their breakup in 2017 turned difficult after an audio clip surfaced, leading Madison to warn fans, “Don’t make the same mistakes I did—your safety is never worth it. No matter what, no one deserves to be treated that way.” It was a painful chapter, but one that helped her step into a stronger sense of self.In 2017, Madison was briefly linked to Brooklyn Beckham after the two were seen together in Los Angeles. She later clarified that they were never official, explaining she couldn’t manage a long-distance relationship once Brooklyn moved to New York. Their short-lived fling was more of a youthful spark than a lasting romance.Madison’s on-and-off relationship with club promoter Zack Bia lasted for about a year. The breakup appeared messy, with Madison tweeting, “Oof I rlly owe myself the biggest apology for puttin’ up w sht I never deserved.”* However, out of the heartbreak came art—her widely loved track “Selfish” is rumored to have been inspired by this chapter in her life.Rumors swirled in 2020 that Madison was more than friends with YouTuber David Dobrik, thanks to her frequent appearances in his content. Both insisted they were never romantically involved, though their playful banter left fans curious. On his podcast, when Madison asked, “So, have you ever rejected me?” David cheekily denied it, putting the rumors to rest.Madison’s most enduring relationship began with TikTok star Nick Austin in 2020. They went public in 2021 when Nick posted a heartfelt birthday message calling her “the love of my life, my best friend, my dream girl, my soulmate.”Unlike her earlier romances, this one has been built on stability. Madison told InStyle in 2023, “I’m super happy within my relationship, and I feel really safe, and I feel like I’m with someone I consider my best friend.”As her career edges toward a new milestone with an upcoming 2025 album, Madison admits she and Nick are “going to figure this all out, hopefully together.” In her own words, she’s a “lover girl”- someone who loves deeply, holds on tightly, and values relationships as anchors in her extraordinary life.Also Read: NFL insider Adam Schefter makes bold prediction on Cleveland Browns quarterback situation amid crowded roster battle",Madison beer has been linked to a number of men over the years.

Donald Trump keeps fueling NFL debates



Aaron Rodgers has never shied away from mixing football with controversy, and his sharpest comments often extend beyond the gridiron. During a 2024 appearance on the Look Into It podcast, the four-time MVP quarterback revisited Donald Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, reigniting debate about the intersection of politics and sports.Aaron Rodgers, who drew widespread scrutiny for questioning vaccine mandates and even flirted with politics himself as a rumored running mate for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argued that Donald Trump failed his own “drain the swamp” promise. His biggest criticism focused on Donald Trump’s decision to keep Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge.“Trump, OK, Trump’s an outsider, all the rhetoric, we’re going to drain a swamp and go after the corruption. And I don’t think a lot happened,” Rodgers said. “What I fault him for is Tony Fauci … not only did Trump push the vaccine, Operation Warp Speed, or whatever the [heck] it was, but he let Fauci stay in charge and shut the country down.”The president, however, hasn’t stayed out of NFL storylines himself. Amid Pittsburgh’s quarterback shuffle, Donald Trump unexpectedly endorsed Mason Rudolph, praising his arm and charisma while predicting he could become “the guy” for the Steelers.Trump’s second term has also divided locker rooms. The Philadelphia Eagles split over attending the White House after their Super Bowl LIX win, while Saquon Barkley drew online fire for golfing with Trump.
