NEW DELHI: Mission Sudarshan Chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons.The defence shield will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats. Announcing the launch of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft -- the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","Mission sudarshan chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield.

NEW DELHI: Emphasising self-reliance as the bedrock of national strength, PM Modi on Friday announced a broad contour of initiatives that will focus on making India secure in different sectors including energy, semiconductor chip manufacturing, critical minerals, digital infrastructure, medicines and fertilisers.He shared that the first 'Made in India' semiconductor chips will come to the market by Dec.""The greater a nation's reliance on others, the more its freedom comes into question. Misfortune arises when depe-ndency becomes a habit, when we do not even realise when we abandon self-reliance and become dependent on others,"" said Modi, citing an example of a semiconductor idea that came to the table 60 years ago but was ""stalled, delayed and shelved"".

Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Do not move from the word to the meaning — move from the meaning to the word. First search for the undertone in the poet’s heart; then explore what the chosen word could mean.”

Realize poems, don’t analyse them.

Poetry is not about dissecting but about integrating.

You don’t have to agree with the poet’s point of view;

Study the words carefully and evaluate the underlying meaning.

At a recent literary festival in Chennai, a celebrated lyricist stirred controversy by interpreting a word from Kambar’sin an unusual way. The verse in question was Vaali’s dialogue to Rama — a moment rich with moral complexity. The wounded king, struck by Rama’s arrow, questions the fairness of being attacked while engaged in combat with his brother. Kambar lets this exchange unfold with grace: Vaali’s probing questions, Rama’s wise answers, and finally, Vaali’s surrender — seeing in Rama not a killer, but his redeemer.In one line, Vaali addresses Rama as a gem and asks,The word Kambar uses —— became the fulcrum of the debate. The lyricist claimed it meant ‘being out of one’s senses’, suggesting that Rama would have escaped punishment murder in such a state. The remark, unsurprisingly, drew outrage.Equally important, however, was the question this episode raised: where should one draw the line when interpreting a poet’s words?The following day,Ilangai Jeyaraj — an eminent scholar and foremost expert in— offered a profound response:He quoted Bharathiyar’s lament that some read epics without ever entering the mind of the creator.From my teachers, I have learned three lessons in the art of reading poetry .The finest poems give us gifts — to the head, the heart, or the soul. To read poetry is to embark on a pilgrimage, not to crack a code. It is the journey where a reader is transformed to a seeker who may walk alone, but whose heart is free and unbound.A poem is not a building where you remove every brick and scaffolding to understand the technicalities. It is a spiritual experience to see how every word and phrase integrate to show us that we are tiny droplets of water in the mighty ocean of life. Poet Billy Collins warns us not to tie poems to chairs and beat them with rubber hoses until they give up their meaning.It is one thing to disagree with a poet; it is another to drag the poet towards your own point of view, twisting words to fit accordingly. What are words, after all, but a container of the soul? Should we be disposing of the food and eating the container?Poetry, at its finest, is a mirror. It shows us what we are. It awakens what is unseen, untouched, and unspoken within us. As Thiru. Ilangai Jeyaraj reminded us, the purpose of epics is to lift human beings from the lowest valleys to the highest peaks — not the reverse.Thiruvalluvar knew well the weight a word can carry.

NEW DELHI: PM Modi rejected Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan as 'unjust and one-sided', reiterating India's position that ""blood and water cannot flow together"" and asserting that India will ""no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail"". In his I-Day speech Friday, the PM lauded Operation Sindoor and the role played by armed forces, while outlining India's ""new normal"" that, he said, will ""not differentiate between terrorism and those who nurture terrorism"".Modi declared from Red Fort that IWT is not acceptable to India as the country's farmers suffered unimaginable losses because of the treaty, backed by World Bank. ""The waters that belong to India will be used by India, for our farmers alone. We would no longer tolerate an arrangement that deprived its farmers. India has endured this for decades. We will not endure it any further. In the interest of our farmers and the nation, this agreement is unacceptable to us,"" PM said.He said Operation Sindoor, which saw India bombing terrorist headquarters in Pakistan and POK, reflected the anger and frustration that people felt after Pahalgam terror attack. ""Terror headquarters hundreds of kilometres inside enemy territory were destroyed. Terrorist infrastructure was turned to rubble. Pakistan is still having sleepless nights. There was so much destruction there that even now there are new revelations coming out,'' said Modi, alluding to the disclosure by IAF last week that six Pakistani aircraft were brought down in the military conflict in May.""For a long time, nuclear blackmail had been going on but this will not be tolerated anymore,'' the PM said.Modi stressed that India will continue to give a befitting reply to enemies of the nation. PM said the country saw the wonders of 'Made in India' in Op Sindoor.""The enemy was shocked at the kind of ammunition that was destroying them within seconds.""

Trump Thinks 50% Tariff on India Has Put Pressure on Russia, Ex-US Official Calls His Strategy Wrong

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade?

After a closely watched closed-door meeting in Alaska that lasted over 3 hours, US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin made their first public remarks — demonstrating both optimism and restraint about the future of bilateral relations and the conflict in Ukraine.The joint press conference, however, lasted only a few minutes.No deal was announced, and neither leader took questions.President Putin opened the joint news conference—an unusual move, as American presidents typically speak first when hosting foreign leaders.He took the opportunity to reflect on the deteriorating state of US-Russia relations, describing them as “fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War.” Emphasising the need to shift from confrontation to dialogue, Putin declared, “Sooner or later, we have to amend the situation.” He called the meeting “long overdue,” underscoring the shared history of Russia and the US, especially poignant in the Alaskan setting.A centerpiece of their private discussions, according to Putin, was the situation in Ukraine. He expressed hope that “the Ukrainians and Europeans choose to not throw a wrench in” the peace process.Putin also thanked Trump for his “well-wishing tone,” noting the need for both sides to focus on tangible results. “Trump clearly cares about the prosperity of his nation. But understands Russia has its own interests,” Putin stated, positioning the dialogue as one of mutual respect and realism.President Trump began his statement on an upbeat note, describing the meeting as “very productive” and noting a considerable number of agreements reached.However, Trump acknowledged that several major issues remain unresolved. “A couple big ones where we haven’t quite gotten there, but we’ve made some headway,” he said.Reiterating his well-known negotiation mantra, Trump stated, “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”He announced his intention to call NATO leaders and other key figures to update them on the meeting’s progress. President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he said, would also be briefed. “It’s ultimately up to them. They’re going to have to agree with what Marco and Steve and some of the great people from the Trump administration who’ve come here,” Trump added, hinting at the broader coalition of voices involved in the process.While the meeting in Anchorage did not yield a definitive agreement, both leaders emphasised progress and the importance of continued dialogue.Trump’s decision to consult further with NATO and Ukrainian leadership signals that the path to resolution—especially regarding Ukraine—will require multilateral cooperation and careful negotiation.At the conclusion of the high-stakes Alaska summit between, Putin delivered a pointed parting remark, saying in English, ""Next time in Moscow"". This statement signals Putin's willingness to continue diplomatic engagements with Trump, potentially inviting the next meeting to be held on Russian soil.The Alaska talks, which lasted several hours, were seen by Putin as a diplomatic victory, allowing him to show resilience against Western isolation efforts following the Ukraine conflict.For Trump, the summit represented a moment to seek progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, with hopes of arranging further negotiations that might include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.As President Trump and President Putin depart Anchorage, the world watches for signs that optimism and engagement will translate into lasting progress. The message from both sides was clear: the door to peace is open, but it will take hard work—and consensus—to walk through.","Putin-trump viral moment after press conference; ‘big laugh like brothers’ shock nato.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday [Friday in the US] faced an unexpected media encounter in Alaska, where reporters bombarded him with questions as he arrived for talks with US President Donald Trump on the Ukraine conflict.During the welcome ceremony, foreign journalists called out questions on issues ranging from civilian casualties to prospects for a ceasefire in the three-year-old war.One question -- “When will you stop killing civilians?” -- drew a gesture from Putin suggesting he could not hear. Another asked why Trump should trust his words. There was no clear response to whether he would agree to a ceasefire.Such open exchanges are rare at events attended by the Russian leader, where the travelling press pool is generally limited to state-approved reporters.Later, the two leaders sat side by side at a US base, flanked by their delegations against a blue backdrop reading ""Pursuing Peace"".While Putin appeared taken aback by a volley of simultaneous questions, Trump looked on.The reporters at the summit again called out queries, but this time, Trump offered only a ""Thank you very much"" before the press was escorted out.The Alaska meeting marks a rare in-person discussion between the US and Russian presidents amid ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, with both leaders under close scrutiny at home and abroad.Ahead of the summit, which could influence the war in Ukraine and relations between Washington and Moscow, Trump said that if the talks with Putin go badly, he ""would walk.""""I think it’s going to work out very well, and if it doesn’t, I’m going to head back home real fast,"" Trump said while talking to American news broadcaster Fox News.""If it doesn’t, you walk?""

Malviya shares Indira Gandhi's 'message' on Savarkar's death



What was oil ministry's post



A social media post by the oil ministry marking Independence Day triggered strong reactions from the opposition, with Congress party accusing the PM Modi government of ""distorting history"" and glorifying “traitors” by placing VD Savarkar above Mahatma Gandhi Taking potshots at the petroleum ministry, Pawan Khera suggested them to serve ""cheap oil instead of cheap comedy"".Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya slammed the grand old party for their criticism of Savarkar as he recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of the freedom fighter, highlighting her words of praise for him.Party general secretary K C Venugopal posted on X, “Every Independence Day, the Modi-led BJP makes it a point to distort history and make heroes out of traitors.”“This Orwellian image, elevating a British mercy petitioner like Savarkar over Gandhi ji - the undisputed Mahatma who got us freedom, and completely eliminating Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel ji, shows their contempt for our freedom fighters.”“What else can one except from those whose forefathers collaborated with the British to sow the seeds of division and hatred that haunts us to this very day?” the Congress leader further added.Congress media and publicity department head Pawan Khera also took aim at the government, posting in Hindi, “While mixing ethanol in petrol, now you've started mixing impurities even in freedom fighters. Those who couldn't become great in history, you're making them big on posters.”“The country is asking you for cheaper oil, not cheap comedy,” he further mocked the organisation.BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh hit back replying to Khera’s post, “Sick brigade to the core... Veer Savarkar lived and died for the country.”Congress whip in the Lok Sabha Manickam Tagore wrote on X, “No matter how hard you try, Mr Modi, you can’t push Mahatma, Netaji & Bhagat Singh below Mafiveer. Don't disgrace the martyrs who fought and died for freedom by glorifying those who begged the British with apology letters.”CPI(M) MP John Brittas also criticised the ministry’s post, saying, “The deliberate elevation of VD Savarkar over Mahatma Gandhi is not a coincidence but a calculated act. The government’s actions undermine the nation's commitment to its secular Constitution. It is pertinent to note that Savarkar was an accused in Gandhi’s assassination, though acquitted due to insufficient evidence.“However, the Kapur Commission highlighted circumstantial evidence implicating Savarkar. Those who uphold the Constitution should unequivocally condemn this mockery of justice and secular values,” he further added.Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, joined the criticism row, writing on X, “Shame on the Patroleum And Natural Gas Ministry for placing the traitor and murderer Savarkar above true patriots and martyrs. That to with money of the exchequer.”Amid the opposition’s criticism, BJP leader Amit Malviya recalled former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s message on the death of Veer Savarkar, highlighting her words of praise for him.She said as per the letter shared by Malviya, “Veer Savarkar’s name has been a byword for daring and patriotism.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday marked his 12th consecutive Independence Day address from the Red Fort ramparts, breaking former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s record of 11 straight speeches.On the 79th Independence Day, he unveiled a series of initiatives aimed at making India self-reliant, technologically advanced, and economically stronger -- with the clear goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047.Announcing an ambitious plan to strengthen India’s defence capabilities, PM Modi launched ""Mission Sudarshan Chakra"", inspired by the weapon of Lord Shri Krishna.The mission aims to create an indigenous air defence system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome to protect critical sites, including civilian areas, from terrorist attacks. The Prime Minister set a 2035 target for expanding and modernising this “national security shield” entirely through domestic research, development, and manufacturing.PM Modi confirmed that India’s first domestically produced semiconductor chips will hit the market by the end of 2025. Highlighting decades of lost opportunity, he said the country’s early semiconductor ambitions were stalled “50-60 years ago,” while other nations surged ahead.The launch, he said, will be a turning point for India’s electronics, automotive, and defence sectors.Warning of demographic changes in border areas, the Prime Minister alleged that infiltrators were threatening livelihoods, targeting women, and misleading tribal communities to seize land.He announced the launch of a “High-Power Demography Mission” to address these concerns, calling demographic shifts in sensitive regions “a direct threat to national security.”Also Read: Independence Day: PM Modi warns ‘India will not tolerate nuclear threats’; strong message to Pakistan from Red Fort The Prime Minister officially rolled out the Rs 1 lakh crore ""PM Viksit Bharat Rozgar Yojana"", aimed at creating 3.5 crore jobs.Under the scheme, youth entering their first private sector job will receive Rs 15,000 from the government, while employers hiring them will get financial incentives.Calling it a “double Diwali” for citizens, PM Modi announced that the government will soon implement next-generation GST reforms to drastically cut taxes on essential goods.He said the changes are “the need of the hour” to ease the financial burden on ordinary people.The prime minister revealed plans for a National Deep Water Exploration Mission, dubbed ""Samudra Manthan"", to explore oil and gas reserves in the ocean.The initiative will operate in mission mode and is expected to advance underwater engineering, mineral resource exploration, and ocean research.A large share of India’s budget is still spent on importing petrol, diesel, and gas. PM announced the launch of the National Deepwater Exploration Mission to harness ocean resources, along with major expansions in solar, hydrogen, hydro, and nuclear energy.The Prime Minister urged young scientists and engineers to develop a fully indigenous jet engine for India’s fighter aircraft.In the space sector, he announced plans for India to have its own space station, alongside preparations for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission. He noted that reforms have enabled over 300 start-ups to enter the space sector, employing thousands of young innovators.Addressing future energy needs, PM Modi said India is working to increase its nuclear energy capacity tenfold by 2047, with 10 new reactors already in progress.He also highlighted a 30-fold increase in solar capacity over the past 11 years and ongoing investments in hydropower, hydrogen energy, and dam construction.To accelerate growth, the Prime Minister announced a Reform Task Force that will modernise laws, policies, and governance systems to prepare India for a $10 trillion economy. The task force will work with fixed deadlines to deliver reforms aligned with global best practices.The government’s reforms are designed to cut compliance costs for startups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, while removing the fear of outdated legal provisions.The goal is to create a business-friendly environment that fosters innovation and supports economic self-reliance.","Pm modi on friday marked his 12th consecutive independence day address from the red fort ramparts.

PM Modi's Stern Warning to Pakistan After Nuclear Threat, Refuses To Resume Indus Waters Treaty

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) criticised Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge over their absence from the official Independence Day celebration at the Red Fort on Friday.Rahul Gandhi is the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, and Mallikarjun Kharge holds the same post in the Rajya Sabha -- both official positions whose holders mostly attend the event.""Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition, was missing from the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort. At the Congress HQ event, he appeared visibly disoriented. The nation deserves to know — is he well?"" wrote BJP I-T cell chief Amit Malviya on X.He further said, ""And why did he choose to skip the official ceremony? For someone in his position, such absence sends a poor message about his commitment to national occasions.""There has been no official statement from the Congress party over the two leaders not attending the Red Fort ceremony.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi greeted the nation on X and wrote: “Happy Independence Day to all countrymen. This freedom, achieved by the sacrifice of great freedom fighters, is a pledge to build such an India — where justice is based on truth and equality, and there is respect and brotherhood in every heart. It is our duty to protect the pride and honour of this precious heritage. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat.”Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also posted on social media and said, “Heartiest greetings and congratulations to all countrymen on Independence Day.We pay our humble tribute to the countless great freedom fighters who made invaluable contributions to the national movement.""Today is an important day because we, the people of India, are now fighting for our rights, protection of constitutional institutions, social justice, economic empowerment, and brotherhood. Let us take this struggle forward together and pledge to protect the interests of every Indian.

Self-reliance in technology Strengthening the economy

Here are key quotes from his speech:



""Whether it's the deserts or the peaks of the Himalayas, the shores of the ocean or the bustling cities, there is one voice across the nation: we all love India more than our lives,"" says PM Modi from the ramparts of Red Fort.

""For 75 years, the Constitution of India has been showing us the path like a lighthouse.""

""I salute our brave soldiers who punished masters of terror beyond their imagination.""

""India has decided that it will not tolerate nuclear threats anymore, we won't fall for any blackmail. Destruction inflicted by our armed forces in Pakistan was so widespread, new revelations are being made every day. After April 22 (Pahalgam attack), we gave armed forces a free hand to respond to terrorists.""

""India has now decided, blood and water will not flow together. The people have come to realize that the Indus Waters Treaty is unjust. Water from the Indus River system has been irrigating the lands of the enemy, while our own farmers have suffered. What kind of agreement is this that has caused such immense loss to our farmers for the past seven decades?""

""Slavery made us poor. It made us dependent, and over time, our dependence on others only grew. But our farmers led us toward self-reliance and ensured our food security. Even today, a nation's true pride lies in self-reliance, and that is the foundation of Viksit Bharat.

""Dependence on others raises questions about a nation’s independence. It is unfortunate when dependence becomes a habit, a dangerous one. That’s why we must remain aware and committed to becoming self-reliant. Self-reliance is not just about exports, imports, the rupee, or the dollar. It is about our capabilities, our strength to stand on our own.""

""Our enemies had no idea about the capability of 'Made in India', which weapons are simple and which are powerful enough to destroy them in a moment. Just think, if we were not self-reliant, would we have been able to carry out Operation Sindoor with such speed?""

""We are working in mission mode in the semiconductor sector, made-in-India chips will hit markets by end of this year. We have decided to make India self-reliant in energy; taking several initiatives in solar, hydrogen, nuclear sectors.""

""India is now focusing actively on nuclear energy. We have taken significant steps in this direction, with 10 new nuclear reactors currently operational. By the time India celebrates 100 years of independence, we aim to increase our nuclear energy capacity tenfold.""

""Today, India is building a modern ecosystem across every sector. I appeal to the youth and to every department of the government: we must strive to produce Made-in-India jet engines for our fighter aircraft. We are known as the pharmacy of the world, but isn't it the need of the hour to invest more in research and development? Shouldn’t we be the ones providing the best and most affordable medicines for the welfare of humanity?""

""Our military will decide the time and give a fitting response to all acts of terror. Pakistan has lost its sleep after Operation Sindoor. India and its farmers have sole right over its share of waters.""

""Our Group Captain Subhanshu Shukla has returned from the Space Station, a moment of great pride for the nation. India is actively working on the Gaganyaan mission and is also planning its own space station. We must come together to change the destiny of our country. I appeal to the youth: step forward and contribute to this mission of national transformation.""

""The world values quality, and if we want to strengthen India's image in the global market, we must focus on producing high-quality products. We should work with the mantra: ‘Daam kam, dum zyada’, lower cost, higher value. Our independence came through immense sacrifice. Remember those years, when an entire nation lived and struggled for freedom. Their dedication gave us independence. Today, our mantra should be ‘Samriddh Bharat’, a prosperous India. If we continue to be vocal for local, we will achieve prosperity. The previous generation gave us freedom; this generation must commit to making India truly prosperous.""

""Need of hour to take a resolve for building a 'samarth' (strong) Bharat, just like our freedom fighters had envisioned 'free India'.""

""I am going to give a great gift on Diwali. In last 8 years, we did a big reform in GST, tax was simplified, now it is the demand of the time to make a review, we did, also talked to states, we are bringing 'next generation GST reform', it will be a gift on Diwali, tax on common, individual requirement services would be reduced significantly... MSMEs would benefit, it will also help the economy.""

""I have good news for the youth of our country. Today, on the 15th of August, we are launching a landmark scheme worth Rs 1 lakh crore, the Pradhan Mantri Viksit Bharat Rojgar Yojana. Under this scheme, the government will provide Rs 15,000 as support to individuals who secure their first job in the private sector. This initiative is expected to generate 3.5 crore job opportunities across the nation.""

""The world is confident about India's economy. We are a ray of hope amidst the global instability. Inflation is under control.""

""Past decade was of reform, perform and transform; now we have to focus on greater goals.

""We celebrate our diversity, it is our heritage. We witnessed this beautifully during the Prayagraj Maha Kumbh, where the spirit of unity in diversity truly comes alive. India is rich in linguistic diversity, and to honor that, we have granted classical language status to Marathi, Assamese, Bangla, Pali, and Prakrit...""

""I salute dedication of RSS volunteers in serving nation over past 100 years. India is proud of RSS' 100 years of dedication towards country, it is biggest NGO in world.""

""I wish to warn the country about a concern that is emerging as a crisis. As part of a premeditated conspiracy, the country's demography is being changed. Seeds of a new crisis are being sown. These ghuspaithiyas (infiltrators) are snatching the bread and butter of our youth. These ghuspaithiyas are targeting our country's daughters and sisters. This will not be tolerated. These ghuspaithiyas are fooling innocent tribals and capturing their forest land. This country will not tolerate this.""

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday addressed the nation from the ramparts of historic Red Fort for the 12th consecutive time on the occasion of 79th Independence Day.The celebration began with PM Modi paying floral tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat. After receiving the Guard of Honour upon arrival at the Red Fort, PM Modi hoisted the flag.The theme of this year is 'Naya Bharat,' reflecting the government's vision of achieving 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047.""Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day .

NEW DELHI: For the 12th consecutive time on Friday, from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation with his longest 103-minute Independence Day speech.As he delivered the speech, the Prime Minister ensured he touched on every key aspect that has an overwhelming bearing on India's growth trajectory and its unrelentless pursuit of an ambitious future.The Prime Minister delivered a message to India and the world on prevailing challenges, emerging uncertainties, possible solutions, and the dream that Bharat envisions to realise by 2047, when India turns 100.""My beloved citizens of India, this festival of independence is a festival of 140 crore resolutions. It is a moment of collective achievements, filled with pride and joy. The nation is continuously strengthening the spirit of unity. Today, 140 crore citizens are immersed in the colours of the Tiranga,"" PM Modi said at the commencement of his speech.Recalling the horrors of the massacre that took place at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22, PM Modi said that Operation Sindoor carried out in retaliation was ""an expression of anger"".""Today, I'm witnessing a special significance on 15th August. I am proud that today, I got the opportunity to salute the brave soldiers of Operation Sindoor from the Red Fort. Our brave soldiers gave the enemies a fitting reply, beyond their imagination.Every Indian was angered by the horrors perpetrated by terrorists in Pahalgam. Operation Sindoor is the expression of that very anger,"" he said.PM said Pakistan still experiences trouble sleeping after Operation Sindoor, as the scale of destruction was so massive.""We gave our Armed Forces a free hand, allowing them to strategise, set the target, and decide the timing. Our forces set a precedent unseen for many decades. They attacked hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory and turned terrorist headquarters to dust. Pakistan’s sleep is still disturbed; the scale of destruction was immense,"" he said.PM Modi reiterated in no uncertain terms that India, which has long been a victim of terrorism, would not differentiate between terrorists and those who shelter them, an indirect but pointed message to Islamabad.The Prime Minister also rebuffed the Pakistani army chief, who is de facto the ruler of the nuclear-armed nation, over a nuclear remark. PM said India would ""no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail"".""Our country has been bearing the pain of terrorism for many decades. We have now set a new normal. Terrorists and those who shelter them will not be seen separately. They are an equal danger to humanity with no difference. India will no longer tolerate nuclear blackmail. If the enemy dares to commit any more misadventure, the Indian Armed Forces will give them a befitting reply,"" PM Modi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India has decided that blood and water will not flow together and that India's share of water belongs to its farmers.""The rivers of India were irrigating the enemy country while our own farmers were deprived of water. Now, the right over India’s share of water belongs only to India and its farmers. A compromise on farmers’ interests and national interests is not acceptable to us. Not anymore,"" PM Modi said.He further said: ""India will absolutely not tolerate the continuation of the Indus Agreement in its current form. In the interest of farmers and the nation, this agreement is unacceptable to us.""In a subtle but conspicuous message, PM Modi said he's standing like a wall in front of any policy that is against the interests of farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India,"" said PM Modi amid tariff row with the US.The United States President Donald Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on India as New Delhi continues to purchase crude oil from Russia.""Modi is standing like a wall in front of any policy against the interest of our farmers, fishermen, cattle rearers of India,"" said PM Modi.""Today India is number one in the world in production of milk, pulses, jute. India is also the second-biggest fish producer. India is also the second-biggest producer of rice, wheat, fruits, vegetables. Export of agro-products worth 4 lakh crore has happened. Many schemes are there to support them. Farmers are becoming courageous with insurance,"" he added.PM Modi said a conspiracy has been hatched to alter the country's demography and that infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods and seizing lands of tribals.""I wish to alert the nation today regarding a concern, a challenge. Under a conspiracy, the country's demography is being altered, sowing the seeds of a new crisis. Infiltrators are snatching the livelihoods of my country's youth, targeting my country's sisters and daughters; this will not be tolerated. These infiltrators are deceiving innocent tribals and seizing their lands; the nation will not endure this,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi said that areas earlier known as ""red corridors"" of Naxalism have now become green corridors of development.""We know that a large part of our country was badly affected by Naxalism. The greatest loss was suffered by the tribal communities. The lives of young sons were ruined. There was a time when Naxalism had taken deep roots in over 125+ districts. Today, we have brought that number down to 20.""He said: ""There was a time when the mere mention of Bastar would bring to mind Naxalism, Maoism, and the sound of bombs and guns. Today, Bastar has freed itself from Naxalism and Maoism, and the youth of Bastar are participating in the Olympics"".PM Modi urged shopkeepers and traders to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products, urging citizens to ""collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life"".""We have carried out huge reforms in Income Tax laws, some people may have missed it amid din. Past decade was of reform, perform and transform; now we have to focus on greater goals. Want our traders, shopkeepers to display boards for 'Swadeshi' products,"" said PM Modi.I want to urge all influencers in the country to help me promote this mantra. I say to all political parties and all leaders, let’s come together...this is not the agenda of any political party, India belongs to all of us. Let us collectively make the Vocal for Local mantra a part of every citizen’s life.India is working towards becoming self-reliant in the space sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday.""The nation is proud of our space sector, Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla is back from the space station... in the days to come he will return to India,"" PM Modi said in his Independence Day address to the nation from the Red Fort.He said India is working on becoming self-reliant in the space sector as well, and is preparing for launch of Gaganyaan. Gaganyaan is India's flagship human spaceflight programme.""We will make our own space station,"" he said.Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi hailed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for completing 100 years of service to the nation, describing it as the ""biggest NGO in the world"" and praising its century-long contribution to nation-building.""Today, I would like to proudly mention that 100 years ago, an organisation was born - Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). 100 years of service to the nation is a proud, golden chapter. With the resolve of 'vyakti nirman se rashtra nirman', with the aim of welfare of Maa Bharati, swayamsevaks dedicated their lives to the welfare of our motherland...In a way, RSS is the biggest NGO of the world. It has a history of 100 years of dedication,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi said no generation in the country should forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency.""The Constitution was violated, we were cheated, we were stabbed in the back… India was turned into a prison, and the Emergency was imposed.""""It has been 50 years of Emergency. No generation in the country should forget this sin of murdering the Constitution. They should not forget the sinners who murdered the Constitution. We should never forget how democracy was murdered, throttled, and backstabbed during the Emergency,"" he said.",Prime minister narendra modi delivered his longest 103-minute independence day speech.

He pointed to unfulfilled promises on semiconductors, farm laws, and job creation, saying the rhetoric on protecting farmers had become “hollow and unbelievable.”Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose accused PM Modi of targeting “a new enemy” in his speech, illegal infiltrators, while over-promising on new initiatives.“As usual, Narendra Modi uses his Independence Day speech to target a new ‘enemy’. After Andolanjeevis, now infiltrators are the new target,” she said, questioning the government’s record of “over-promising and under-achieving. ”AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi criticised Modi for glorifying the RSS from the Red Fort, calling it “an insult to the freedom struggle.” He said the RSS did not participate in India’s independence movement and promoted exclusionary Hindutva ideology. “Modi could have gone to Nagpur to praise RSS as a swayamsevak; why did he do it from the Red Fort as Prime Minister?” Owaisi questioned.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also took a dig at the PM, saying the RSS should “thank the British” on completing 100 years, referring to the organisation’s origin during colonial times. He questioned Modi’s swadeshi rhetoric, citing trade deficits with China and the US, and argued that Independence Day should not be used for political messaging.In his speech, PM Modi hailed 100 years of RSS as a “very proud and glorious” journey, calling it “the biggest NGO in the world,” and announced a high-powered demographic mission to tackle illegal infiltration. He also emphasised self-reliance in sectors such as semiconductors, social media, fertilisers, and pharmaceuticals.","Pm narendra modi's 79th independence day speech from the red fort drew criticism from opposition leaders.

"Months after Sindoor, India plans its own 'Iron Dome'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/months-after-sindoor-india-plans-its-own-iron-dome/articleshow/123326642.cms,"PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: Announcing the launch of an ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.It will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around identified locations, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons. This will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats, if not for actual warfare.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft, the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s new announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","All important places in india, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.

BJP: Public discourse today shaped by RSS ideology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-public-discourse-today-shaped-by-rss-ideology/articleshow/123326543.cms,"NEW DELHI: As opposition parties slammed PM Narendra Modi over his remarks praising RSS in his independence day speech, BJP dismissed the criticism asserting that the Hindutva organisation's ideology is shaping India's public discourse today.BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya recalled that the country's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had invited the RSS to join the Republic Day parade in 1963 and had called it an organisation of patriots. ""As the RSS marks 100 years, it is fitting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentions it from the Red Fort,"" he said, reacting to Congress leader Jairam Ramesh's criticism.Malviya said, ""India's public discourse today is shaped by RSS ideology, while the Congress is detached not only from the realities of our times but also from Nehru himself."" In his speech, Modi had hailed 100 years of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a ""very proud and glorious"" journey of likely the ""world's biggest NGO"" and lauded all its volunteers for their dedicated service to the nation.Himself a RSS 'pracharak' for decades, Modi has praised the organisation earlier too and chose the occasion to highlight its journey since its foundation in 1925. RSS has been connected with BJP, and its functionaries work at key positions in the party organisation.","Pm narendra modi had hailed 100 years of rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) as a ""very proud and glorious"" journey.
