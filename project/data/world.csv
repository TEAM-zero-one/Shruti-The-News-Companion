Bangladesh Tourist: Bangladesh tension leads to 9% fall in foreign tourist arrivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-tension-leads-to-9-fall-in-foreign-tourist-arrivals/articleshow/128834332.cms,"Ex-Envoy Sikri Explains Anti-India Sentiment In Neighbourhood, India-Bangladesh Ties Under BNP Govt

NEW DELHI: The tension between India and Bangladesh, which resulted in fewer visas by both sides, resulted in an over 9% fall in foreign tourist arrivals to 90.2 lakh in 2025, with the eastern neighbour slipping from the second largest source to being the fifth biggest.Latest official data estimated tourist arrivals from Bangladesh at 4.7 lakh in 2025, 73% lower than the level in the previous year. The 12.8 lakh decline was more than the 9.3 lakh fall in the overall foreign tourist arrivals during the year.Travel industry insiders are not exactly moaning about this decline as they always questioned adding Bangladesh arrivals into FTA numbers as majority of them come for non-tourism purposes such as medical treatment and work and don’t exactly fill up hotels and line up at tourist spots.On the other hand, the number of Indians going abroad rose 6.6% to a record 3.3 crore in 2025, although there was a dip in those going to Saudi Arabia and the US. Last year, the number of Indians flying to Canada also declined nearly 16% to 8 lakh.“India is outpricing itself in terms of star hotel rates despite reasonable domestic airfares in non-peak seasons. So, the Indian middle class now finds it cheaper to go to places like the UAE, CIS countries, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia than going to domestic destinations such as Goa or Kerala.And foreign tourists find a cheaper alternative to us,” said a leading travel agent.Many frequent Indian travellers say they get “good” hotel rooms for Rs 5,000-8,000 in these places while the same in India is at least double in low season and can increase manifold in peak holiday time.Asked about high tariffs, a leading hotelier said: “India is seeing a rise in business travel and domestic travel remains strong. So, we have no reason to worry over foreign tourists skipping till such time that our properties are full. The demand for luxury stays is far more than the supply and this imbalance will ensure good yields (rates) for the big players here.” Indian carriers are also expanding majorly on foreign routes to cash in on the boom in outbound travel.",Tension between india and bangladesh resulted in fewer visas by both sides.

NEW DELHI: Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday vowed to take action against those responsible for the reference to judicial corruption in an NCERT textbook, amid indications of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unhappiness over what he considers to be a grave lapse.Modi is learnt to have flagged the controversial inclusion of corruption among judiciaries in the theme dealing with problems facing administration of justice in the new NCERT Class VIII social science texbook. “What are we teaching Class VIII children about judicial corruption?” sources quoted the PM as saying at the meting of the Union Cabinet on Tuesday.As the NCERT scrambled to stem the fallout from the Supreme Court’s fury over the issue, taking off the book’s e-version from its website and figuring out ways to get hold of the 32 hard copies that had been sold, Pradhan offered an unconditional apology.He affirmed respect for the judiciary while promising to fix accountability and take action against those who drafted the controversial chapter. The issue centres on Chapter 4 — “Role of the Judiciary in Our Society” — in the new social science textbook (Part 2) brought out by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). Edited by Michel Danino and Alok Prasanna, the chapter listed corruption, massive case pendency and shortage of judges as challenges faced by the judicial system.The controversy escalated on Thursday when the Supreme Court observed that there appeared to be a “well-orchestrated conspiracy” to defame the judiciary and imposed a “blanket ban” on the NCERT book, ordering that all physical and digital copies be seized.Meanwhile, NCERT, when asked, said the e-version of the textbook was “not uploaded online”.“Thirty-two physical copies were sold before distribution was halted” — a figure also cited by the solicitor general in court.The council to a question on how it was tracking and recalling the already-sold books, a senior NCERT official said, “As all the books have been sold through NCERT depots, they were tracked and majority of them have been already recalled.” The chapter will now be rewritten in consultation with appropriate authorities and made available from the 2026–27 academic session.On the top court’s observations, Pradhan said he was “deeply saddened by what had happened, stressed that there was no intention to insult the judiciary” and added that “an inquiry would be conducted to identify those responsible”. He added that circulation of the textbooks was immediately put on hold once the issue came to light and that the govt would fully comply with the Supreme Court’s directions.Following stern remarks from the SC that it would not allow “anyone on earth” to tarnish the judiciary’s integrity, NCERT pulled the textbook from its website. The council on Wednesday apologised for “inappropriate content” and said the chapter would be rewritten in consultation with appropriate authorities before being reissued, even as officials said tighter review mechanisms for future textbooks are now being examined.",Pm narendra modi is learnt to have flagged the controversial inclusion of corruption among judiciaries in the theme dealing with problems facing administration of justice.

India and Israel upgraded what PM Narendra Modi described as a time-tested relationship to a special strategic partnership, announced a new NSA-led partnership in critical and emerging technologies and reaffirmed commitment to their long-standing defence cooperation after a bilateral meeting between Modi and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. As they signed 16 MoUs/ agreements, India and Israel also committed to an early finalisation of a mutually beneficial free trade agreement (FTA) they are currently discussing.Carrying on from where he left in his Knesset address, Modi again strongly condemned terrorism saying it has no place in the world and, while backing the Gaza Peace Plan, stressed “humanity must never become a victim of conflict”.

This will impart fresh momentum to cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum technologies, and Critical Minerals,” he said. According to the joint statement, this initiative would synergise the individual strengths of both countries in niche technologies, fostering a focused and futuristic partnership.Looking to promote regional connectivity, both sides agreed to move forward with “renewed momentum” on the India-Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and India–Israel–UAE–USA (I2U2).On terrorism, Modi said that India and Israel are unequivocal in their position that terrorism cannot be accepted in any form and manifestation. “We have stood shoulder to shoulder in opposing terrorism and those who support it, and we will continue to do so,"" he said, carrying on from where he left on the issue in his Knesset address.The leaders condemned cross-border terrorism in the joint statement, including the Pahalgam attack, Red Fort “terror incident” and the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist strikes. “They called for decisive and concerted international efforts to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner.

Indian young adults rank lowly 60th in 84-nation mental health study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-young-adults-rank-lowly-60th-in-84-nation-mental-health-study/articleshow/128831188.cms,"NEW DELHI: Young adults in India ranked 60th out of 84 countries in key mental well-being parameters in the 2025 report of an ongoing global mental health study, scoring significantly poorly than their peers aged 18-34 in most parts of the world.The 'Global Mind Health in 2025' released Thursday by US-based Sapien Labs reveals not just a serious mental health crisis among young Indian adults but also a profound generational gap, as older people enjoyed significantly better mental health scores.The report, which surveyed over 78,000 internet-enabled individuals in India, assigned young adults (18-34 years) a low mind health quotient (MHQ) score of 33. This contrasts sharply with an MHQ score of 96 for those aged 55 and above, a level aligning with normal mental function and putting them at rank 49 among 84 countries. This stark difference highlights a ""structural, multi-year generational shift"" in mental well-being that researchers suggest is not merely a temporary effect of recent events like the pandemic.""The scores reflect a very steep decline in younger generations - steeper than many other countries globally.While those aged 55+ are doing fine, younger adults are seriously struggling,"" said Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs.""This reflects declines in the factors we have outlined in the study, and some others, as well such as increased toxic load in the environment (air, water, food) and lack of physical activity,"" she added.The study says the mental health crisis among India's youth goes beyond issues such as anxiety and depression, reflecting a broader reduction in core mental functioning, including the ability to regulate emotions, maintain focus, build stable relationships, and recover from stress.Based on data generated in previous years, the study identifies four key drivers of mental health - family bonds, spirituality, consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) and early exposure to smartphones. In India, the 64% of respondents in the 18-34 age group reported being close to their family, compared to 78% of those over 55.While relatively lower than in some other nations, regular UPF consumption among young Indian adults (44%) was substantially higher than among the older generation (11%). The average age for a first smartphone in India was 16.5 years, a figure expected to be much lower for Gen Alpha, with earlier exposure linked to increased mental health risks.Globally, the study found young adults in economically developed countries struggling with mental health much more than their counterparts in less developed nations. Those at the bottom included Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the UK and China, while countries with relatively better mind health were predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania. Finland, which consistently tops the World Happiness Index, ranked 28 on mind health for those 55+ and 40 for those 18-34 years - indicating that satisfaction with circumstances of life was distinct from mental capacity to navigate life's challenges .The mind health quotient is a metric that aggregates respondent ratings of 47 cognitive, emotional, social and physical capacities and problems that enable or diminish our ability to function effectively. The scale reflects a person's fundamental mental capacity, says Sapien Labs.","Young adults in india ranked 60th out of 84 countries in key mental well-being parameters.

'Heads Must Roll': Centre Says Sorry Over NCERT Chapter, Supreme Court Demands Accountability

Here are the key observations made by the Supreme Court:

""They have fired the gun and the judiciary is bleeding today. Today, anybody can say anything. At times, there is a mounting attack on us, and we are aware of it. The material is available online, on the internet, and even in stores.""

""This is a very calculated move -- the entire teaching will be dictated. When you look at how the Indian judiciary is portrayed as corrupt, it becomes evident what message is being sent. The entire teaching community will first be instructed that this is what they have to teach.""

""In reality, not a single section of society has been left untouched. It is a deep-rooted, well-planned, and orchestrated conspiracy."" the CJI said.

""There is not a single word of apology in NCERT's communication, and instead, they have justified it.""

""It is my duty to find out who is responsible; heads must roll,"" said CJI Surya Kant.

""We would like to have deeper probe,"" said the Supreme Court.

""It seems there is a calculated move to undermine institution and demean dignity of judiciary.""

""If allowed to go unchecked, this will erode people's faith in judiciary.""

""Such misconduct, having everlasting impact on judiciary, would fall within definition of criminal contempt.""

The top court further ordered a blanket ban on further publication of NCERT book, having ""offending chapter"" on judiciary in physical and digital form. The court directed Centre, state authorities to immediately comply with its directions.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday strongly reprimanded the NCERT over its now-withdrawn chapter in the newly introduced Class 8 textbook, which had been added to the syllabus days ago and outlined “corruption” and “backlogs” in the judiciary. Calling it a “deep-rooted conspiracy,” the CJI issued a show-cause notice to the NCERT director and pushed for action, seeking a “deeper probe” into the matter.Amid the controversy surrounding the top court’s remarks, it also directed the seizure of physical and digital copies of the NCERT textbook in circulation that contained the chapter on judicial “corruption.”The court will hear suo motu case on this matter on March 11.This follows the introduction of a new NCERT social science textbook for Class 8, which highlighted key challenges facing the country’s judicial system, including corruption, a heavy backlog of cases, and an insufficient number of judges.The revised chapter, titled ‘The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society’, goes beyond explaining the structure of courts and access to justice, addressing systemic issues that affect the functioning of the judiciary.Previous editions primarily focused on the organisation and role of courts.One section of the new textbook discusses corruption within the judicial system and its impact on access to justice, particularly for economically disadvantaged groups. “People do experience corruption at various levels of the judiciary. For the poor and the disadvantaged, this can worsen the issue of access to justice. Hence, efforts are constantly being made at the State and Union levels to build faith and increase transparency in the judicial system, including through the use of technology, and to take swift and decisive action against instances of corruption wherever they may arise,” the chapter states.The textbook also provides data on the scale of pending cases across courts, estimating around 81,000 cases in the Supreme Court, about 62.40 lakh in high courts, and approximately 4.70 crore in district and subordinate courts.","The supreme court has strongly reprimanded the ncert over its now-withdrawn chapter in the newly introduced class 8 textbook.

'Heads Must Roll': Centre Says Sorry Over NCERT Chapter, Supreme Court Demands Accountability

NEW DELHI: Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday said that ""we have utmost respect for judiciary"" and action will be taken against those responsible for drafting a controversial chapter on judicial corruption in the Class 8 NCERT textbook.The remarks follow the Supreme Court’s directive to ban the book, seize physical copies and remove its digital versions.Reacting to the apex court’s order, Pradhan said, “Accountability will be fixed, and action will be taken against those involved in drafting the chapter on judicial corruption.”He added, “We have utmost respect for the judiciary, and the court’s directives will be complied with.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also expressed support for the judiciary. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra described the issue as “sensitive”.Speaking about the ruling Patra said, “So far as the NCERT issue is concerned, it's a sensitive matter. I would like to put forth the party's stand as its spokesperson that there is no other institution, I would say not only in India but in this whole world, that is as independent and as deserving as the Indian judiciary is.”He further highlighted that Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured the court that the government stands with the judiciary.The controversy arose after the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant, raised objections to the chapter titled “The Role of the Judiciary in Our Society” in the newly introduced Class 8 social science textbook.The top court termed the content on corruption, backlogs and inadequate number of judges as “objectionable” and a possible “well-orchestrated conspiracy to defame the judiciary.”A three-judge bench, including Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, took suo motu cognisance of the matter following representations by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi.The apex body also issued a show-cause notice to the NCERT Director and the School Education Secretary, demanding explanations on why action should not be taken against them. CJI Surya Kant stated, “It is my duty to find out who is responsible; heads must roll.” The top court also warned of serious consequences if the directions to enforce the blanket ban on the textbook were ignored.NCERT promptly apologised for the inappropriate content, withdrew the book from its website and halted further distribution. The council stated that the book will be rewritten in consultation with relevant authorities to ensure compliance with the apex court’s directions. Out of the 2.25 lakh printed copies, 38 copies had already been sold, which are being retrieved.The chapter had outlined India’s judicial system while referencing corruption, backlogs of cases and insufficient judges. This prompted the apex court to intervene to protect the institution’s integrity and maintain public confidence in the judiciary.","Education minister dharmendra pradhan says action will be taken against those responsible for drafting a controversial chapter on judicial corruption.
