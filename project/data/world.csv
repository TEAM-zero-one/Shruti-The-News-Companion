GDP data a 'slap in face' for Rahul Gandhi: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gdp-data-a-slap-in-face-for-rahul-gandhi-bjp/articleshow/123608776.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister Shivraj Chouhan Saturday countered US President Donald Trump's description of India as a ""dead economy,"", saying the latest GDP figures showed that ""India is a long live economy"" on the path to becoming developed and self-reliant. Trump's statement was endorsed by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi who, too, had said ""Indian economy is dead"".Besides Chouhan, BJP said the latest data showing India's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 7.8% in April-June came as the ""hardest slap of reality"" for Rahul. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, ""This is a slap in the face for those who made false statements to defame India, especially the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi who should apologise to the nation.""Govt data released Friday showed that the Indian economy grew by 7.8% in April-June - the highest in five quarters - before the disruptive US tariffs were imposed.Echoing Chouhan, urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar Saturday said at an event that a big country was talking about sanctions and tariff. ""Today there was a jolt to that system when India recorded a 7.8% growth in GDP in the first quarter when people felt that we would be down.If we grow like this, the skeptics will shut their mouths"".GDP growth in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal was mainly due to good performance by the farm sector.""Those who call it a 'dead economy' should now understand that India is a 'long live economy' which is on the path to realising the dream of a developed and fully self-reliant India,"" Chouhan said in a post on X. ""The sweat of Indian farmers, the hard work of our scientists and 140 crore Indians have demonstrated their capabilities.""BJP's IT cell head Amit Malviya said, ""For the acerbic, delusional, frustrated, and rejected Rahul Gandhi - the same man who declared India a 'dead economy' - the latest GDP numbers are the hardest slap of reality.""""India has just clocked 7.8% GDP growth in Q1 of FY 2025-26, leading the world's major economies,"" Malviya said in a post on X. The only thing ""dead"" is Rahul Gandhi's credibility, he claimed.Attacking govt over US President Donald Trump's criticism of the Indian economy, Rahul recently said that everybody except PM Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman knew that the country's economy was ""dead"".","India's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 7.8% in april-june.

No permanent friends or foes in international ties: Rajnath Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-permanent-friends-or-foes-in-international-ties-rajnath-singh/articleshow/123608540.cms,"'The more pressure is put on India, the more it'll emerge as strong rock'

NEW DELHI: There are no permanent friends or enemies in international relations, only permanent interests, defence minister Rajnath Singh stressed on Saturday, amid the tariff tension with US and the thaw in India-China relations.India will ""never compromise with its fundamental interests and principles"", and will remain steadfast on its policies and self-reliance drive to preserve its strategic autonomy and emerge stronger ""despite any global pressure"", Singh said, in an apparent reference to US President Donald Trump's imposition of 50% tariffs on New Delhi.The minister's remarks, which did not name the US directly, came even as PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit.PM Modi reached China on Saturday to attend the SCO summit, where he is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with the Chinese and Russian Presidents, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, respectively. ""India does not consider anyone its enemy. But for us, the interests of our people, our farmers, our small traders are paramount. We cannot compromise on our country's welfare at any cost. No matter how much pressure is exerted, India will continue to give the highest priority to the interests of its farmers, small businessmen, shopkeepers, livestock keepers, and common citizens,"" Rajnath Singh said, speaking at the NDTV Defence Summit.""We all study in geography that the more pressure is applied, the stronger the rock becomes. I feel that the more pressure is put on India, the more it will emerge as a strong rock,"" he added. Amid ongoing geopolitical churn and disruption, Singh said ""a kind of protectionism"" has been seen from the ""so-called developed countries"", with ""trade and tariff wars"" becoming increasingly serious. Referring to Edmund Burke's calling the British East India Company as ""a state in the guise of a merchant"", he said the description can be changed to ""a merchant in the guise of a state"" in the current circumstances.Noting that the world and technology is changing rapidly, with new challenges emerging in the form of pandemics, terrorism and regional conflicts, Singh said self-reliance is not just an option or an advantage but a strategic necessity essential for India's survival and progress. ""Today's shifting geopolitics has also made it clear that external dependency in the field of defence is no longer an option for us. In the current situation, self-reliance is essential for both our economy and our security,"" he said.""Under PM Modi's leadership, our govt has always believed that it is only through ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' that we can strengthen our strategic autonomy. This very approach will keep us secure in the times to come and also secure us a leading position among the world's emerging powers,"" he added. Hailing Operation Sindoor as a shining example of India's growing indigenous defence capabilities, he said, ""It may appear to be a story of a war of a few days, of India's victory and Pakistan's defeat, but years of strategic preparation and defence preparedness were behind it. ""","'the more pressure is put on india, the more it'll emerge as strong rock' says rajnath singh. His remarks came even as pm modi reached china on saturday to attend the sco summit.

Fewer than 50 missiles brought Pak to its knees: IAF vice chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fewer-than-50-missiles-brought-pak-to-its-knees-iaf-vice-chief/articleshow/123608240.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Army fired as many as 30,000 artillery and mortar shells as well as over3 lakh rounds of small arms across the Line of Control in response to Pakistan's ceasefire violations during the May 7-10 hostilities, Northern Command chief Lt-General Pratik Sharma said on Saturday.""For every round fired by Pakistan (after IAF and Army conducted precision strikes against nine terror hubs in Pakistan and POK on May 7), we retaliated with a minimum of three to four rounds,""Lt-Gen Sharma said, while blaming Pakistan army chief Asim Munir for ""directly inciting"" terrorists and his forces before the Pahalgam terror massacre on April 22, which in turn led India to launch Operation Sindoor . IAF vice chief Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari, speaking at the same NDTV summit, reiterated that less than 50 air-launched weapons fired by India at airbases and radar sites in Pakistan during Operation Sindoor compelled the western adversary to sue for peace and a ceasefire.""We hit them so hard that by mid-day (on May 10) they wanted to talk. Key takeaway for us, that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve conflict elimination... It is very easy to start a war, but not easy enough to end it,"" Air Marshal Tiwari said, armed with videos and satellite imagery to showcase the damage to terror and military infrastructure caused in Pakistan.IAF had deployed Sukhoi-30MKI, Rafale and Mirage-2000 fighters to launch BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as Crystal Maze-2, Rampage and Scalp missiles for the calibrated pinpoint strikes on the Pakistani airbases and radar sites, a few of them close to nuclear facilities as well as command and control structures, as reported by TOI earlier.Both the officers said the political directives were clear about undertaking punitive strikes with minimum collateral damage, catering for escalation and creating a deterrence in Pakistan army's mind, and complete operational freedom was given to the armed forces for the same.Lt-Gen Sharma further said that the Pahalgam massacre came soon after Munir, in a ""provocative speech"" on April 16, claimed Kashmir was Pakistan's ""jugular vein"" while invoking the two-nation theory.""This was direct incitement to not only the terrorists but also the Pak army...

Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that donald trump had secretly died, was put to rest on saturday when the president was photographed teeing off at his virginia golf club.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","Us federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president donald trump under emergency powers were illegal.

"Modi to meet Xi, Myanmar military leader ahead of SCO summit; PM to approach China ties with long-term view",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-meets-xi-today-amid-global-trade-disruptions/articleshow/123608092.cms,"Indian PM Modi Gets Red Carpet Welcome In China | Xi Jinping Embraces India Amid Trump Bullying

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","Pm narendra modi landed in tianjin saturday evening for what is his first visit to china in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Donald Trump's immigration crackdown: Chicago mayor signs order blocking police role in raids; vows city won’t 'take orders',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-immigration-crackdown-chicago-mayor-signs-order-blocking-police-role-in-raids-vows-city-wont-take-orders/articleshow/123609517.cms,"File photo: Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago mayor brandon johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist us president donald trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, The New York Times reported on Saturday, detailing how ties between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have ""unravelled"" in recent months.In a report titled The Nobel Prize and a Testy Phone Call: How the Trump-Modi Relationship Unravelled, the NYT, citing people familiar with Trump's schedule, said: ""After telling Mr Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall.""There was no official comment from either government on the report.India is scheduled to host the Quad Summit later this year. Earlier in January, the Trump administration had hosted the Quad foreign ministers' meeting, a day after Trump took the oath of office for a second term.The article linked the souring ties to Trump's repeated assertions that he had resolved the four-day conflict in May between India and Pakistan -- claims denied by New Delhi.""President Trump's repeated claims about having 'solved' the India-Pakistan war infuriated Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And that was only the beginning,"" it said, adding that PM Modi was ""losing patience"" with Trump.On June 17, PM Modi and Trump spoke for 35 minutes as Trump returned to Washington from the G7 Summit in Canada, which PM Modi also attended.The two were due to meet on the sidelines of the summit in Kananaskis, but Trump left early, prompting PM Modi to speak to him over the phone before his departure.During that call, Trump invited PM Modi to stop over in Washington, but the request was declined as PM Modi had a scheduled visit to Croatia.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri later said in a video message from Kananaskis that PM Modi told Trump ""at no point during the days following Operation Sindoor was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US trade deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan.""Misri added that talks to end military action were initiated by Pakistan and handled directly through existing channels between the two armed forces.According to the NYT, during the June 17 call, Trump again claimed credit for ending the escalation and noted that Pakistan intended to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize . ""The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same,"" the paper reported.PM Modi, however, ""bristled. He told Mr Trump that US involvement had nothing to do with the recent ceasefire. It had been settled directly between India and Pakistan,"" the report said.""Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,"" it added.The White House did not acknowledge the call, and Trump made no mention of it online, though he has repeated his claim of halting the conflict ""over 40 times since May 10.""The NYT framed the episode as ""the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.""The report also tied Trump's recent tariffs on India -- an additional 25% duty on Russian oil purchases -- to frustrations with Prime Minister Modi. It described the ""colossal penalties on India in particular” as “punishment for not falling in line rather than any kind of cohesive effort to reduce the trade deficit or cut off funding for"" Russia’s war.Richard Rossow, chair on India at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying: ""If this was a real change in policy in trying to squeeze Russia, Trump could have put his weight behind legislation that would have imposed secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian hydrocarbons. The fact that they have uniquely targeted India says this is about more than just Russia.""The NYT added that Trump, ""frustrated by the tariff negotiations,"" tried reaching out to PM Modi several times, but the Prime Minister Modi ""did not respond to those requests.""","Us president donald trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit india later this year for the quad summit.

LoC shootout ends decades-long run of ‘human GPS’ terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/loc-shootout-ends-decades-long-run-of-human-gps-terrorist/articleshow/123607511.cms,"SRINAGAR: Bagu Khan knew every trail, every ridge, every hidden path across the LoC. The terrorist guide dubbed “human GPS” was killed in a gunfight with security forces in north Kashmir’s Gurez sector on Aug 28, officials said Saturday.Security officials said Khan had facilitated nearly 100 infiltration attempts over decades, often slipping across the LoC himself. A resident of Bandipora in north Kashmir, he allegedly crossed into PoK in 1995 for arms training and first joined Hizbul Mujahideen. He later shifted between groups but earned his nickname for navigating treacherous mountain passes with uncanny precision.Khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt in Naushera Nar of Bandipora. Soldiers spotted suspicious movement along the LoC and challenged the intruders. “They opened fire. Troops responded with counter-fire, neutralising two terrorists,” the Army said. The second slain man is believed to be a Pakistani.Officials said Khan’s death could deal a blow to infiltration networks along the LoC. His mastery of terrain made him indispensable for Pakistan-backed banned groups. “Loss of such an experienced guide can limit the ability of infiltrators to negotiate high-altitude routes and escape detection,” a source said.Official sources estimated 70 Pakistani terrorists are currently active in J&K, aided by guides like Khan to cross rugged terrain — deep gorges, dense forests, mountain caves, and natural hideouts offering ample cover. These highly trained intruders typically move in small groups of three to four, carry sophisticated weapons, including M4 carbines, and use iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery to coordinate and avoid detection. Their capability to exploit terrain and technology remains a serious challenge for security forces.This year, forces have killed 16 terrorists in Kashmir region, including three top Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives linked to the April 22 Pahalgam attack. The trio was shot dead in Srinagar on July 28.In a separate action Saturday, J&K police said they attached immovable property worth lakhs of rupees in Pulwama belonging to Gulzar Ahmad Dar, father of “designated terrorist” Arjumand Gulzar alias Hamza Bhai of banned outfit Al-Badr.Police warned civilians against aiding terrorists. “Police once again appeal to the general public not to provide shelter or support to terrorists, failing which they shall face strict legal action,” the statement read.","Bagu khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt.

Russia Claims Its S-400 Missile System Is Shooting Down Missiles Fired From U.S. Patriot Systems

NEW DELHI: The Press Information Bureau (PIB) on Saturday dismissed as propaganda Pakistan’s claims that India’s S-400 air defence system was ""damaged"" during Operation Sindoor , the counterterror military strikes launched by India after the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam.The PIB Fact Check wing clarified on X: ""Some pro-Pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that India admits its S-400 being damaged by Pakistan.""It added, ""Reports of destruction or any damage to an S-400 system are false & baseless.""Clarifying further, it said the image being circulated with these claims was actually from a Victory Parade held in Russia in May 2010.The clarification followed reports after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, where Lashkar-e-Taiba affiliated terrorists opened fire on civilians, killing 26 people.In retaliation, India carried out Operation Sindoor, striking nine major terror hubs, including Lashkar’s headquarters in Muridke and Jaish-e-Mohammad’s stronghold in Bahawalpur.Pakistan responded with a barrage of drones and missiles, all of which were intercepted and neutralised by India, with the S-400 system playing a central role.India subsequently struck back at Pakistan’s key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan. The exchange of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours finally ended after Pakistan’s DGMO contacted his Indian counterpart to agree on a ceasefire across land, air, and sea.","The pib fact check wing clarified on x: ""some pro-pakistan social media handles are circulating claims that india admits its s-400 being damaged by pakistan"" it said the image being circulated with these claims was actually from a victory parade held in russia in may 2010.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123603840,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1154127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Vice Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari on Saturday said that fewer than 50 weapons were fired at targeted Pakistani military locations, compelling Islamabad to request the cessation of military hostilities by mid-day of May 10.Recounting the Operation Sindoor , Air Marshal Tiwari, during the NDTV Defence Summit, said that the IAF achieved ""complete domination"" over the Pakistan military through strikes executed following Pakistan's attack on the night of May 9 and 10.""I must tell you that it was a key takeaway for us that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve complete domination. It has not happened before,"" Tiwari said.The senior IAF officer, who played a key role in Operation Sindoor, mentioned that some Pakistani targets ""taken out"" during the mission were not hit even during the 1971 war. ""We made every weapon count and that is a tacit acknowledgement of the capability of our planners and people who executed the missions,"" he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam terror attack . The strikes led to four days of intense clashes, culminating in an agreement to halt military actions on May 10.The Vice Chief of Air Staff further elaborated on the sequence of events related to Operation Sindoor and presented graphic details of India's response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Air Marshal Tiwari stated that India was not inclined to escalate the situation following its strikes on Pakistani terror infrastructure on the early morning of May 7.""We expected a response and still kept it calibrated, and we engaged only military targets. But when the main attack came on the night of May 9-10, that was the time we decided that we needed to go and send the right message. We hit them pan-front,"" he remarked. ""There were targets which were taken out, which were not even taken out during the 1971 war. That is the kind of extent and damage to capability that we had caused to them,"" he said, adding that the IAF limited its strikes to only military targets.The senior IAF officer explained that the purpose behind the strikes was to eliminate Pakistan's capability and convey the ""right message"". He acknowledged that employing long-range vectors to target enemy positions involves risks, but the IAF executed the mission flawlessly.""The precision targeting from this range is very very essential as it is very risky because the longer the vector, you feel that there are more chances of collateral damage."" ""But to the credit of our planners and credit of people who executed the missions, we were able to take out each target precisely. We were able to ensure there was no collateral damage. This is not an easy game,"" he added.""You may have a long-range vector, but the work that goes behind making that vector or that weapon hit a target accurately is actually an effort of the whole team, not only the pilots who fired them. There are a lot of people on the ground who make that happen,"" he noted. Following the strikes on terror infrastructure, India informed Pakistan of its desire not to escalate the situation, clarifying that the strikes targeted terrorist bases. However, as Pakistan initiated a military retaliation, India responded strongly.","India launched operation sindoor on may 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by pakistan.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The army is raising the first lot of five 'bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

Bullet Train Diplomacy: Modi’s Shinkansen Ride with Japan PM Signals India’s High-Speed Rail Future

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was greeted with chants of “Modi-san, welcome!” as he arrived in Sendai, Japan, on Saturday during his two-day visit.Large crowds gathered at the city’s semiconductor hub, cheering his name and calling out “Welcome to Japan.” Travelling from Tokyo to Sendai on the Shinkansen bullet train with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, PM Modi later met Indian train drivers undergoing training in Japan.Upon arrival, he interacted with Indian loco pilots undergoing training with Japanese Railways before touring key industrial facilities, including the Tokyo Electron Factory- semiconductor plant and a bullet-train coach manufacturing site.The semiconductor facility in Miyagi Prefecture is being developed by Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) in partnership with SBI Holdings and Japanese firms under the joint venture Japan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (JSMC).Located in the Second Northern Sendai Central Industrial Park in Ohira Village, the plant will produce 12-inch semiconductor wafers, starting with 40-nanometre technology and later expanding to 28 nm and 55 nm nodes.It will primarily serve the automotive electronics sector, which is witnessing rising demand with the growth of electric vehicles and next-generation mobility solutions.Earlier in the day, PM Modi met governors of 16 Japanese prefectures in Tokyo and called for stronger state-prefecture cooperation under the India-Japan special strategic and global partnership, the ministry of external affairs said. He was also presented with a Daruma Doll by Rev Seishi Hirose, chief priest of the Shorinzan Daruma-Ji Temple. The Daruma is an iconic cultural symbol of Japan, with historical and spiritual roots connected to India.On Friday, PM Modi arrived in Tokyo to a warm reception by members of the Indian and Japanese communities. The welcome featured cultural performances, including classical dances such as Mohiniyattam, Kathak, Bharatnatyam and Odissi, along with folk songs presented in Rajasthani attire.Japanese nationals recited the Gayatri Mantra, while members of the Indian diaspora greeted the Prime Minister with chants of “Bharat Mata ki jai.”PM Modi’s two-day official visit marks his first standalone trip to Japan in nearly seven years. He is attending the 15th India-Japan Annual Summit at the invitation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The summit will review progress across multiple areas of cooperation and discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest.Following his engagements in Japan, PM Modi will travel to Tianjin, China, from August 31 to September 1 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit.","Pm narendra modi was greeted with chants of “modi-san, welcome!” as he arrived in sendai, japan, on saturday during his two-day visit.

He also sought an immediate ceasefire saying peace talks were not possible while fighting was still on.Zelenskyy briefed Modi about his meeting with President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington this month and later said he had spoken to Modi to “coordinate” position with India ahead of the SCO summit in Tianjin, suggesting he expects the PM to stress ceasefire when he meets Putin on the margins of the summit. He in fact said Modi seemed ready to convey the “appropriate signal” to Putin.“We exchanged views on the ongoing conflict, its humanitarian aspect, and efforts to restore peace and stability. India extends full support to all efforts in this direction,” said Modi in a post on X. Capitals across the Western world, particularly Washington, will closely follow Modi’s meeting with Putin for the message he conveys to Putin on the war.Shortly before Zelenskyy and Modi spoke, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation India should not be unfairly targeted over the Ukraine conflict. Jaishankar said in a post on X that the discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and recalled that India has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. Valtonen said just and lasting peace in Ukraine requires more pressure on Putin to engage in real negotiations.Both the conversations came against the backdrop of repeated and hostile targeting of India by senior Trump administration officials for its trade links with Russia. The US has imposed an additional 25 percent tariffs on India for its crude purchase from Russia and Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro last week went to the extent of calling the Ukraine situation Modi’s war.While the government has made it clear to the US it won’t budge on the red lines it has drawn in trade negotiations, and that its oil procurement will continue to be guided by national interests and strategic autonomy, it has also so far avoided a public spat with Washington, exercising what many have described as strategic restraint. “Almost two weeks have passed (since his meeting with Trump in White House), and during this time, when Russia should have been preparing for diplomacy, Moscow has given no positive signal – only carried out cynical strikes on civilian targets and killed dozens of our people,” said Zelenskyy in his readout of the conversation with Modi.He said the end of this war must begin with an immediate ceasefire and that this position is understood and supported by everyone. “It is impossible to speak meaningfully about peace while our cities and communities are under constant fire. India is ready to make the necessary efforts and to deliver the appropriate signal to Russia and other leaders during the meetings on the sidelines of the summit,” said Zelenskyy, adding he will be glad to meet the Prime Minister in the near future.","Ukraine president volodymyr zelenskyy dialled modi to say that while ukraine was ready for a meeting with putin, russia continued to carry out “cynical strikes” zelenkyy said peace talks were not possible while fighting was still on.

What is the SCO?



China’s port city of Tianjin is set to become the stage for high-stakes diplomacy as world leaders gather for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, hosted by President Xi Jinping . Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin are among the most closely watched attendees, marking PM Modi ’s first visit to China since 2018.The SCO meet unfolds against the backdrop of global unease triggered by Trump’s tariff offensive. Trump has imposed a 50% duty on India over its ""massive"" oil imports from Russia, threatened China with similar penalties, and continues efforts to ""broker peace"" in the Russia-Ukraine war.Xi, who in July 2024 told SCO members in Kazakhstan that ""no mountain or ocean can distance people who have shared aspirations,"" is expected to leverage the summit to project China as a stabilising force and rally the Global South against US influence. The presence of PM Modi, representing the world’s largest democracy, alongside President Putin, who maintains firm control over the largest-country in the world -- Russia, adding further weight to the gathering in Tianjin.More than 20 foreign leaders and the heads of 10 international organisations are likely to attend. Confirmed participants include:According to CNN, delegations will also arrive from 16 SCO partner and observer countries, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt, Cambodia, Bahrain, and Nato member Turkey.Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has grown into a major regional bloc. Its agenda spans joint counterterrorism drills, intelligence sharing against “terrorism, separatism, and extremism,” and expanding cooperation in trade, education, and energy.The grouping also promotes a “just” international order, shorthand for a multipolar system not dominated by one superpower and its allies.",Shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) summit to be held in china's port city of tianjin.
