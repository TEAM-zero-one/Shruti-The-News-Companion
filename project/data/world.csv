‘Mouths shut when Hindus are killed’: Yogi targets opposition in Assembly

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, during a press conference held in Amravati.He referred to recent reports that claimed people's identities were being determined through mobile phones. Owaisi said that the UP government should be ""congratulated"" for the new ""invention"" to determine whether a person is Bangladeshi by placing a mobile phone on their back.Owaisi sarcastically said that even leading scientists and ISRO would be surprised by this ""technology.""He questioned whether citizenship and identity in India would now be determined by mobile phones. He said that such actions were not only ridiculous but also against both the law and the Constitution.Furthermore, Owaisi claimed that after a mosque, the administration has now taken bulldozer action against madrasas, which are being termed illegal, in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district. He alleged that the government is acting arbitrarily in the name of bulldozer action and misusing the law.He alleged that the government is targeting a particular community and using the bulldozer as a political weapon.However, the administration says that the action is being taken only against illegal constructions and there is no discrimination against any community.The AIMIM chief alleged that such manoeuvres are creating an atmosphere of fear among the public and arbitrariness in the name of law and order. He demanded that the government adhere to constitutional and legal procedures on serious issues like identity and citizenship.He levelled serious allegations against the Modi government and the ruling parties regarding electoral politics. He stated that first, there was the issue of vote theft, and now candidates are being ""stolen.""He alleged that in many places, candidates are being forced to withdraw their nominations through intimidation, threats, or bribery, which is a very dangerous trend for democracy.Owaisi said that if voters are not provided with a candidate of their choice, the very foundation of democracy will be weakened. He also said that this process directly violates the public's right to vote, reducing elections to a mere formality.On the BMC elections, Owaisi said, ""If elections are being held unopposed anywhere through intimidation, threats, or bribery, then it is a threat to our democracy.""Owaisi appealed to political parties to keep constitutional obligations and social harmony in mind when making statements on issues like elections and population.Owaisi raised several serious questions about the central government's foreign policy and security strategy. He said that after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India took a tough stance and tightened its water-related agreements against Pakistan, but despite this, there was no hesitation in playing against Pakistan in international cricket tournaments.Calling this a ""double standard,"" Owaisi asked why normal relations are being pursued on the playing field while issuing strong statements on terrorism.Speaking on the Bangladesh issue, Owaisi said that a clear and transparent policy should be formulated regarding illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India. Those living illegally should be deported through legal procedures, but the entire process should be in accordance with the Constitution and human values. He said that political stability in Bangladesh is crucial for the security and development of India, especially the northeastern states.Owaisi also said that increased strategic activities by China near the Bangladesh border and the presence of elements linked to Pakistan's intelligence agency are matters of concern. He stressed that these issues should be viewed not merely from a political perspective but in the broader context of national security.",All india majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen (aimim) national president asaduddin owaisi on has criticised the yogi adityanath government in uttar pradesh.

‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

(Narendra Modi is the Prime Minister of India and is also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust)

Somnath… hearing this word instils a sense of pride in our hearts and minds. It is the eternal proclamation of India’s soul. This majestic temple is situated on the western coast of India in Gujarat, at a place called Prabhas Patan. The Dwadasha Jyotirling Stotram mentions the 12 Jyotirlings across India.The stotram begins with “Saurashtre Somnatham Ch”, symbolising the civilisational and spiritual importance of Somnath as the first Jyotirling.It is also said: Somalingam Naro Drishtva Sarvapapaih PramuchyateLabhte Phalam Manovaanchitam Mritah Svargam SamaashrayetIt means: Just the sight of Somnath Shivling ensures that a person is freed of sins, achieves their righteous desires and attains heaven after death.Tragically, this very Somnath, which drew the reverence and prayers of millions, was attacked by foreign invaders, whose agenda was demolition, not devotion.The year 2026 is significant for the Somnath Temple . It has been 1,000 years since the first attack on this great shrine. It was in Jan of 1026 that Mahmud of Ghazni attacked this temple, seeking to destroy a great symbol of faith and civilisation, through a violent and barbaric invasion.Yet, one thousand years later, the temple stands as glorious as ever because of numerous efforts to restore Somnath to its grandeur. One such milestone completes 75 years in 2026. It was during a ceremony on May 11th, 1951, in the presence of the then President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad , that the restored temple opened its doors to devotees.The first invasion of Somnath a thousand years ago in 1026, the cruelty that was unleashed upon the people of the town and the devastation that was inflicted upon the shrine have been documented in great detail in various historical accounts.When you read them, the heart trembles. Each line carries the weight of grief, cruelty and a sorrow that refuses to fade with time.Imagine the impact it had on Bharat and the morale of the people. After all, Somnath had great spiritual significance. It was also on the coast, giving strength to a society with great economic prowess, whose sea traders and seafarers carried tales of its grandeur far and wide.Yet, I am proud to state unequivocally that the story of Somnath, a thousand years after the first attack, is not defined by destruction. It is defined by the unbreakable courage of crores of children of Bharat Mata.The medieval barbarism that began a thousand years ago in 1026 went on to ‘inspire’ others to repeatedly attack Somnath. It was the start of an attempt to enslave our people and culture. But, each time the temple was attacked, we also had great men and women who stood up to defend it and even made the ultimate sacrifice. And every single time, generation after generation, the people of our great civilisation picked themselves up, rebuilt and rejuvenated the temple. It is our privilege to have been nurtured by the same soil that has nurtured greats like Ahilyabai Holkar, who made a noble attempt to ensure devotees can pray at Somnath.In the 1890s, Swami Vivekananda visited Somnath and that experience moved him. He expressed his feelings during a lecture in Chennai in 1897 when he said, “Some of these old temples of southern India and those like Somnath of Gujarat will teach you volumes of wisdom, will give you a keener insight into the history of the race than any amount of books. Mark how these temples bear the marks of a hundred attacks and a hundred regenerations, continually destroyed and continually springing up out of the ruins, rejuvenated and strong as ever! That is the nationalmind, that is the national lifecurrent. Follow it and it leads to glory. Give it up and you die; death will be the only result, annihilation, the only effect, the moment you step beyond that life current.”The sacred duty of rebuilding the Somnath Temple after Independence came to the able hands of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. A visit during Diwali time in 1947 moved him so much that he announced that the temple will be rebuilt there. Finally, on May 11th, 1951, a grand temple in Somnath opened its doors to devotees and Dr Rajendra Prasad was present there. The great Sardar Sahib was not alive to see this historic day, but the fulfilment of his dream stood tall before the nation.The then Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was not too enthused with this development. He did not want the honourable President as well as ministers to associate with this special event. He said that this event created a bad impression of India. But Dr Rajendra Prasad stood firm and the rest is history. No mention of Somnath is complete without recalling the efforts of KM Munshi, who supported Sardar Patel very effectively. His works on Somnath, including the book, ‘Somanatha: The Shrine Eternal’, are extremely informative and educative.Indeed, as the title of Munshi Ji’s book conveys, we are a civilisation that carries a sense of conviction about the eternity of spirit and of ideas. We firmly believe that that which is eternal is indestructible, as outlined in the famous Gita verse “ Nainam Chhindanti Shastraani ...”. There can be no better example of our civilisation’s indomitable spirit than Somnath, which stands gloriously, overcoming odds and struggles.It is this same spirit that is visible in our nation, one of the brightest spots of global growth, having overcome centuries of invasions and colonial loot. It is our value systems and the determination of our people that have made India the centre of global attention today. The world is seeing India with hope and optimism.They want to invest in our innovative youngsters. Ourart, culture, music and several festivals are going global. Yoga and Ayurveda are making a worldwide impact, boosting healthy living. Solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges are coming from India.Since time immemorial, Somnath has brought together people from different walks of life. Centuries ago, Kalikal Sarvagna Hemchandracharya, a respected Jain monk, came to Somnath. It is said that after praying there, he recited a verse, “ Bhavabijaankurjananaaraagaadyaah Kshayamupagataa Yasya” . It means: Salutations to That One in whom the seeds of worldly becoming are destroyed, in whom passion and all afflictions have withered away. Today, Somnath holds the same ability to awaken something profound within the mind and soul.A thousand years after the first attack in 1026, the sea at Somnath still roars with the same intensity as it did back then. The waves that wash the shores of Somnath tell a story. No matter what, just like the waves, it kept rising again and again. The aggressors of the past are now dust in the wind, their names synonymous with destruction. They are footnotes in the annals of history, while Somnath stands bright, radiating far beyond the horizon, reminding us of the eternal spirit that remained undiminished by the attack of 1026. Somnath is a song of hope that tells us that while hate and fanaticism may have the power to destroy for a moment, faith and conviction in the power of goodness have the power to create for eternity.If the Somnath Temple, which was attacked a thousand years ago and faced continuous attacks thereon, could rise again and again, then we can surely restore our great nation to the glory it embodied a thousand years ago before the invasions. With the blessings of Shree Somnath Mahadev, we move forward with a renewed resolve to build a Viksit Bharat, where civilisational wisdom guides us to work for the welfare of the whole world.Jai Somnath!","The year 2026 is significant for the somnath temple.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Compared with the uae and saudi arabia, bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126234204,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-648989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'Lunatic Rulers’: Shashi Tharoor, Singhvi, Owaisi, Other Indian Leaders On US Strikes In Venezuela

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday weighed-in on the US strikes on Venezuela, a day before, calling it ""law of the jungle"".The US carried out multiple airstrikes on Venezuela early Saturday, triggering explosions across Caracas and paving the way for the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The dramatic escalation was confirmed hours later by US President Donald Trump. Venezuelan authorities declared a state of emergency as panic swept the capital following the attacks, which left at least 40 people dead.Talking about the situation, the chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, replied to a post by Indian author Kapil Komireddi, saying ""International law and the UN Charter have for some years now been honoured in the breach. The Law of the Jungle prevails today. “Might is Right” is the new creed.""Congress general secretary in charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh also gave a statement on behalf of Congress saying, ""The INC expresses very grave concern on US actions relating to Venezuela in the past 24 hours. Settled principles of international law cannot be violated unilaterally.""Meanwhile, Congress leader and Member of Rajya Sabha Abhishek Manu Singhvi called it ""19th-cen imperialism"".""Regime change by cruise missile, democracy delivered by warship, & sovereignty rewritten under self-styled Doctrine? Not leadership, this is 19th-cen imperialism in 21st-cen jargon. If international law matters only to weak, UN should shut shop. world deserves rules, not lunatic rulers,"" he said on X.AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said that US set an example that India should follow. """"Today we heard that US President Donald Trump's forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and took him from his country to America. If US President Donald Trump can abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his own country, then you (Prime Minister Modi) can also go to Pakistan and bring back the mastermind of the 26/11 terrorist attacks to India,"" he said.In response to Owaisi, BJP MP Gulam Ali Khatana said, talking to ANI, ""The entire country has praised the Indian armed forces. The way terrorists were eliminated and neutralised under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, only Prime Minister Modi's government could have done this. Were we supposed to bring them here and feed them?""Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC also hit back at the AIMIM leader saying, """"Asaduddin Owaisi, don't you worry. Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India has become the world's fourth-largest economy. We have demonstrated unparalleled strength through Operation Sindoor, we have launched missiles, we have eradicated terrorism from Pakistan... we have even secured the extradition of Tahawwur Rana... Unlike you, we do not engage in appeasement politics. .. You continue with your politics of appeasement, and we will continue doing our work.""Shaina NC also spoke about the escalating situation in Venezuela itself. ""India has always maintained cordial relations with Venezuela, with strong diplomatic engagements over the years. This is a matter of grave concern, as ties with Latin America and South America have been carefully nurtured,"" she said, while talking to PTI.Further referring to the MEA statement on the crisis she added, ""The Ministry of External Affairs has advised that the safety of Indian nationals living there should be prioritised. No country can go around bullying the world; the situation must be viewed holistically. The global community today is worried about such actions, surgical strikes, and, above all, the safety of citizens, which must be seen from a collective global perspective. ”The ministry of external affairs, in its official statement, reiterated India’s support for the safety of people in Venezuela. ""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" it said.""We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability of the region.

Indian Army Raises Bhairav Special Force With Over One Lakh Drone Operatives For Modern Warfare

NASIRABAD: At a time when the Centre is pushing for restructuring the defence forces, the Indian Army has carried out one of the biggest ever transformations to meet modern warfare challenges creating a pool of over one lakh drone operatives across the force.Bhairav, the latest Special Force raised by the Indian Army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare, as all operatives are capable of handling drones and use them in real operations for targeting bases and formations inside enemy territory.Team visited one of the newly raised Bhairav battalions in the desert sector under the Southern Command, where it witnessed the capabilities of the troops who had been selected from Infantry regiments to raise the Special Force and were being given special training as per the requirements of modern warfare.The Bhairav battalions raised by Army Headquarters with lessons from global and own conflicts in mind, have been created to provide a dedicated force for high-speed, offensive operations to carry out the Special Forces tasking at multiple levels as per requirements.The Indian Army has raised around 15 of these battalions already, and they have been assigned to different formations on both borders and have plans to raise around 25 of them in total in the near future.The Bhairav battalions would also bridge the gap between the Para Special Forces and the regular Infantry battalions. The Bhairav would also be tasked to carry out Special Operations at tactical to operational depth.""Modern warfare is changing at a very rapid pace. The conflicts of today are hybrid in nature, and one needs to be fully equipped with modern technology to be able to deal with the Challenges. The Bhairav battalions have also been created as part of the force restructuring, which have been raised in line with the requirements of modern technology, new thought process and as per the new operational requirements,"" Commanding Officer of the 2 Bhairav Battalion told ANI in an exclusive interview.""I am the Commanding officer of the desert Bhairav battalion of the Southern Command of the Indian Army. The desert has its own challenges where special skill sets, endurance and technology are required to be used in the right way. That is why the Bhairav has been raised as a technology-driven system which can operate independently and carry out multi-domain operations in the future,"" he added.Explaining about the formation of the unit, the Commanding officer said, ""The desert Bhairav Battalion has been raised on the concept of 'Sons of the Soil' as the majority of the troops are from Rajasthan who can understand the terrain, language, weather and the area. The battalion has been built upon the legacy of the valour and gallantry of Rajanghan, and that is our biggest strength. We are ready to meet any challenge in the desert sector. ""The Bhairav battalions have trained very hard in the last five months since their raising, using modern technology and carried out successful operational validation during the Exercise Akhand Prahar, where the troops showcased their readiness in the presence of Southern Army Commander Lt Gen Dhiraj Seth.The Commanding Officer said the force was evolving very strongly and emerging as the ""Swift, Capable and Decisive"" force of the Southern Command and the Indian Army. The Bhairav battalions would also be part of the India Army's Army Day Parade at Jaipur to be held on January 15 this year. The 2 Bhairav, also known as the Desert Falcons, would be taking part in the event.The Indian Army has also carried out major force restructuring keeping in mind the operational requirements and created Rudra Brigades, which are all-arms formations that combine infantry, mechanised units, tanks, artillery, special forces, and unmanned aerial systems with dedicated logistics and combat support.The Artillery, Mechanised Infantry and the Armoured Corps are also being equipped with modern warfare equipment like drones and other capabilities to be able to perform tasks more efficiently.","Bhairav, the latest special force raised by the indian army- is being readied to tackle the challenges of modern warfare.

‘Avoid All Non-Essential Travel To Venezuela’: India Issues Advisory For Citizens After US Strikes

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Sunday reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.""Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,"" the MEA said in a statement.""We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability of the region.

Rodriguez, 56, is a senior figure in Venezuela’s socialist leadership and a close ally of Maduro. She has previously served as vice president, finance minister and oil minister, and has played a central role in economic decision-making as the country grappled with US sanctions and surging inflation.","The ministry of external affairs on sunday reiterated india’s support for the safety and well-being of people in venezuela.

People in the know of the development said an informal group of ministers is holding deliberations on this agenda.They added that the themes have been chosen considering govt targets’ focus to achieve the goal of a developed nation by undertaking major reforms to push growth.Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the government since Aug 15, 2022, when PM Narendra Modi spoke about it from the ramparts of the Red Fort. This was also one of the five pledges (Panch Pran). “When we see even the smallest thing related to colonialism in us or around us, we have to be rid of it... Indians should shed ‘colonialism’ from their minds and habits,” Modi had said.Last week, speaking at the Veer Baal Diwas programme, the PM had said that by 2035, people will ensure that the nation is completely “free from the mentality of slavery”. He has increasingly invoked the theme of colonialism and the need to shed its lingering impact on the national psyche and development.Construction of the new Parliament building, changing the name of Rajpath to Kartavya Path and shifting the seat of power from the South and North Blocks are also being seen as part of this government’s bigger plan to put an end to the colonial past.Similarly, the government has projected that the economic growth and improved ranking in ease of doing business are results of its agenda of reforms.Officials said that while the ministries will share the steps they have taken so far, they will also provide some details of the future steps to improve ease of living and doing business.",Removing traces of colonialism has become the talking point for the government.

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the latest Forbes 400, with an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion, driven largely by their majority ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, which Forbes ranks as the National Football League’s sixth most valuable franchise. York, who took control of the team in 2000, now sees her son Jed York serving as CEO, while the family has also expanded into global soccer with their takeover of Leeds United in 2023.Their ranking places them ahead of billionaires like Mark Cuban, Stephen Spielberg, and Donald Trump, underscoring how central sports ownership has been to the York family’s growing financial power.","Denise debartolo york and her family landed at no. 163 on the 2025 forbes 400, with forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

Cardi B shares a cryptic message seemingly aiming at her boyfriend, Stefon Diggs

Stefon Diggs has refused to discuss his former private chef’s allegations in public





Stefon Diggs’ high profile romance with Cardi B seems to have hit a pause ever since the New England Patriots’ star player was accused of being physically violent towards his former private chef.While his former private chef has also dragged Cardi B into the mess, it seems the Grammy winner has a different set of strong feelings towards Stefon Diggs now.A few hours ago, the “Am I the Drama?” artist, Cardi B, took to her Instagram channel to share a cryptic message that read as, “Prayer without movement is noise”.This message of hers comes in shortly after reports of Stefon Diggs religiously praying before and after every game had sparked chaos.Many fans feel Cardi B might be hinting at how her relationship with Stefon Diggs has changed after he was accused of being physically violent towards his former private chef.However, neither Stefon Diggs nor Cardi B has responded to the speculations yet as the Grammy winner remains distant from the legal trouble.While Stefon Diggs has been accused of strangling and being physically violent towards a private chef on 2nd December, he has strongly denied the accusations.Stefon Diggs’ lawyer, David Meier, issued a statement to E! News, which read as, ""Stefon Diggs categorically denies these allegations. They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and were never investigated—because they did not occur.”The statement added, “The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee's satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.""Interestingly, Stefon Diggs’ team, the New England Patriots, have also stood by him and has allowed him to participate in the playoffs.This has sparked outrage among fans as many feel that Stefon Diggs is going “unpunished”.At this point in time, Stefon Diggs has refused to discuss the matter in public as he reassures fans to be focusing on being there for his team, the New England Patriots.Also Read: Who is Aileen Lopera?

Charlie Kirk's Old Nicki Minaj Comments Resurface After His Widow Erika Shares Stage With Rapper

Brian Harpole, Candace Owens, and the video that sparked online debate





A newly resurfaced video has put fresh focus on the death of Charlie Kirk, weeks after he was shot at a public event. The clip shows Brian Harpole, who was part of Kirk’s security team, standing in the crowd shortly before the shooting. The video began spreading on X in late December 2025 and quickly caught public attention. Many people online are now asking questions about what happened just before the attack. Some users are urging Candace Owens to look into the footage. At the same time, police have been clear. They say Tyler Robinson is the only suspect in custody, and no official report has linked Harpole to the killing.The shooting took place at Utah Valley University on 10 September 2025 during a Turning Point USA event. While the video has raised debate online, authorities say the investigation has not changed.The video at the center of the discussion is made up of short clips from the event. In the footage, a man believed by some X users to be Brian Harpole is seen standing among attendees. His arms are folded, and one hand is partly hidden. Some viewers say this looks strange. Others say the clip shows nothing unusual and no sign of a weapon or violent act.The video gained attention after it was posted by Blake Bednarz on 29 December 2025. Bednarz wrote that the man in the video “had his folded arms with right hand hidden under his armpit when he squeezed.” Other users pushed back right away. They said the clip lacks clear context and does not prove anything.As the clip spread, several users asked Candace Owens to review it. One user, Katie Ash, wrote on 30 December 2025, “I have been screaming this since Candace and Erika’s meeting!” Another account said the video looked important but asked how such claims could be proven. Some reactions were emotional, with users saying the situation was upsetting, while others questioned how the event was handled.Candace Owens had already mentioned Harpole on her podcast on 9 December 2025. She said, “I received SHOCKING information which puts Charlie Kirk’s last trip to Asia in a new light. And it involves his security detail, Brian Harpole.” Candace Owens added that the claim came from a man in witness protection. She did not share documents or proof. Police have not confirmed her claim and continue to say Robinson is the only suspect.Brian Harpole is a former Texas police officer with 14 years of experience. He later started Integrity Security Solutions. In November 2025, he appeared on The Shawn Ryan Show and spoke about security planning. He said about the venue choice, “That’s where they told us to have it.” No evidence has tied him to the shooting.Also Read: Candace Owens Highlights New Claims Raising Serious Questions After Eyewitness Mitch Snow Shares Details On Charlie Kirk Death Timeline","Charlie kirk killing video raises new questions as brian harpole footage spreads and candace owens is urged to respond.

Caolan Robertson raises doubts over Nick Shirley’s reporting style and Minnesota fraud claims







Nick Shirley’s viral Minnesota daycare video is now facing fresh questions after Irish journalist Caolan Robertson said Shirley once told him his work was “satire,” not real journalism. The claim comes as Shirley’s recent fraud allegations continue to spread online and gain attention from high-profile figures.Shirley’s Minnesota video, posted in mid-December, suggested daycare centers were empty while receiving public funds. The clip went viral and was even retweeted by JD Vance on December 28. In his post, Vance praised Shirley’s work and called it “far more useful” than the 2024 Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting.But Robertson says Shirley’s past actions raise serious doubts. Robertson, who previously interviewed Shirley in Ukraine, says Shirley made videos suggesting there was no war happening there. When confronted in Kyiv, Robertson claims Shirley admitted his work was not journalism.“When I confronted Nick about what he did here in Kyiv, he said what he was doing wasn’t journalism, it was satire, and his entire reporting started to fall apart,” Robertson said.Robertson shared a clip from their interview to support his claim. He also said people who guided Shirley in Kyiv later told him Shirley was shown bombed locations, including a children’s hospital, but chose not to show them in his videos.Robertson believes Shirley follows the same pattern wherever he goes. He says Shirley films a small area, makes big claims, and then moves on without showing full facts.“Nick has a very specific talent. He shows up somewhere, films a couple of streets, announces he’s cracked the whole story. No data, no depth. Just vibes,” Robertson said. “Then we jump to Minneapolis. It’s the same tactic — drop in, film selectively, inflame, provoke, declare victory, go viral.”One location featured in Shirley’s Minnesota video was ABC Learning Center in Minneapolis. Shirley suggested the daycare was empty. But when CBS News visited the center later in December, reporters found more than a dozen children inside, along with several staff members.Director Ahmed Hasan told CBS News the children were working on math and basic language skills. His wife, Umi Hasan, who helps run the center, said she believes Shirley’s video was politically motivated.“We pay our taxes. We do whatever we can to be a law-abiding citizen. When one Somali does something wrong, we all get collective punishment,” Umi Hasan said.Ahmed Hasan also said the center received constant phone calls from people outside Minnesota after the video went viral, adding to stress for staff and families.Also Read: Who Is Nick Shirley?

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Monday amidst mixed global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,300, BSE Sensex was near 85,700. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,323.95, down 5 points or 0.017%. BSE Sensex was at 85,710.66, down 51 points or 0.060%.The focus this week is on a data calendar, both in India and overseas, as markets move into the early stage of the earnings season. Domestically, investors will track the final readings of the HSBC Services PMI and Composite PMI for cues on economic momentum.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The year 2026 has begun with major geopolitical developments which can have profound consequences. The US action in Venezuela has the potential to further destabilise global geopolitics. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is likely to linger longer; there can be worsening of the protests in Iran and how the Iranian regime reacts to that in the context of threat of intervention by Trump; and perhaps even China might use this time of huge uncertainty for annexation of Taiwan. The huge uncertainty and unpredictability of geopolitics will influence the market, too.We will have to wait and watch how things unfold.”“A positive for India from the Venezuelan crisis is that its medium to long-term impact is bearish for crude. The market is likely to remain resilient in the near-term since we are at an all time high and the momentum might support the bulls. The Bank Nifty is strong and has fundamental support from impressive credit growth. Q3 results of the banking and financials segment will be good.”Global markets offered support after Wall Street closed higher on Friday. The Dow and the S&P 500 ended the session in green, snapping their four day losing streak at the start of 2026, led by gains in technology and industrial stocks such as Nvidia, Intel and Boeing.Asian equities also advanced, touching record levels as investors continued to favour technology shares.In commodities, oil prices showed mild gains on Monday as traders assessed the potential impact of political turmoil in OPEC member Venezuela on crude shipments, following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the Donald Trump administration.On the domestic institutional front, foreign portfolio investors were net buyers of Indian equities worth Rs 289 crore on Friday, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth Rs 677 crore, providing additional support to the market.","The focus this week is on a data calendar, both in india and overseas, as markets move into the early stage of the earnings season.

'They Won't Survive': GOP Lawmakers Reveal 2 New Trump Targets After Maduro Operation





US President Donald Trump on Sunday openly threatened possible military action against Colombia, saying such a move “sounds good to me”.His comments come just a day after the United States carried out an operation in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores and transporting them to New York to face federal charges.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump launched a sharp attack on Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro, accusing his government of producing and exporting cocaine to the United States.“Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long,” Trump said.Also Read | 'If they don't behave': Is second strike on Venezuela off the table? Trump's fresh warning When asked directly whether the United States would carry out a military operation against Colombia, the president replied, “It sounds good to me.”According to an audio recording of the interaction with reporters, Trump’s remarks were made during a conversation about US efforts to counter drug trafficking in the region.Maduro and Flores were removed from Caracas by US forces, flown aboard the USS Iwo Jima in the Caribbean and later taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They face charges in the Southern District of New York, including conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.Trump’s latest remarks on Colombia follow months of rising tensions between Washington and Bogotá, amid a US military build-up in the Caribbean and the administration’s increasingly aggressive posture toward Latin American governments accused of enabling drug trafficking, according to Reuters.Last month, Trump issued a sharp warning to Petro from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, accusing Colombia of allowing cocaine production and exports to the US. “He has to watch because he’s got drug factories. He’s no friend to the United States,” Trump said at the time.In another statement, Trump said, “We love the Colombian people, but their new leader is a troublemaker, and he better watch it.” Claiming that Colombia has at least three major cocaine manufacturing facilities, he added, “We know where they are. He better close them up fast.”The warnings marked an escalation in a months-long feud between the two leaders, with Trump repeatedly suggesting that countries sending illegal drugs into the US could face military strikes. During a cabinet meeting earlier this month, he said, “Anybody that’s doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack.”Colombia has historically been one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America, but relations have deteriorated since Petro, the country’s first leftist president, took office in 2022.Petro has strongly rejected Trump’s accusations, saying that his government has been seizing cocaine at unprecedented rates and destroying drug-production laboratories without foreign military intervention. Last month, he even invited Trump to visit Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to see the government’s efforts firsthand.“Come to Colombia, Mr. Trump… but do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the Jaguar,” Petro wrote in a post on X. He warned that any attack on Colombia would amount to a declaration of war and accused the US of violating international norms.Petro also condemned the US operation in Venezuela, calling it an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America that could lead to a humanitarian crisis.","Us president donald trump openly threatened possible military action against colombia.

YouTuber Sneako stirred a row after making a provocative post about US foreign interventions, saying that if any other country attacked a foreign nation hastily, it would be called terrorism—but for America, it is considered colonialism.“If a brown country invaded America to bomb DC and kidnap the president for the sole purpose of stealing our oil, we would rightfully call them terrorists. When Americans do it it’s called colonialism,” Sneako said, referring to the US invasion of Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.Last week, the United States conducted a massive military strike in the Latin American country, launching what President Donald Trump described as a “large‑scale military operation” that included airstrikes in and around Caracas. Maduro and his wife were captured and flown to the United States to face federal charges.Trump announced the operation the opeartion on social media and dubbed it Operation Absolute Resolve. Maduro is set to appear in a Manhattan federal court on charges including narco‑terrorism and drug trafficking.The MAGA circles appreciated the Trump administration's move to invade Venezuela, but Democratic lawmakers cited that the GOP government took steps without congressional approval and called the strikes unconstitutional.Moreover, right-wing influencer Matt Welsh dismissed Sneako's remarks that the US does whatever it wants. Welsh said ""No Brown country"" is capable of attacking Washington. Welsh also agreed upon the views of vice president JD Vance, defence secretery Pete Hegseth that America can use brute force to bring upon justice in any part of the world.

US President Donald Trump late Sunday issued another stern warning to Venezuela, saying the US would launch another strike “if they don’t behave.” Invoking the Monroe Doctrine, he defended America’s recent Operation Absolute Resolve and the strikes on Venezuela that led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were taken into US custody.The strong US military action in Venezuela resulted in the capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday, just hours after a dramatic operation unfolded in the capital city of Caracas.Speaking about the strikes in Venezuela and invoking the Monroe Doctrine, Trump said, “It’s about peace on Earth. We’ve got to have peace. It’s our hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine was very important when it was done, and other Presidents, a lot of them, lost sight of it. I didn’t…”He added, ""I knew the possible danger, it was a very dangerous operation. We had a few injured, but all are in good shape right now...One of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back, and nobody was killed...Don't ask me who's in charge because I'll give you an answer and it'll be very controversial... We're in charge.""Maduro and his wife are being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Centre and will face federal charges and trial on grounds of drug trafficking and working with cartels.Also Read | Rubio says US won't govern Venezuela, clarifies Trump’s 'run the country' remarks The pair have been charged in the Southern District of New York with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess those weapons.Maduro has repeatedly rejected allegations that he is a cartel leader, accusing the US of using its “war on drugs” as a pretext to target Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, estimated at about 303 billion barrels, nearly one-fifth of the world’s total, according to the US Energy Information Administration.","Us president donald trump late sunday issued another stern warning to venezuela, saying the us would launch another strike “if they don’t behave” invoking the monroe doctrine, he defended america’s recent operation absolute resolve and the strikes on venezuela that led to the capture of president nicolás maduro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126342667,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1123326,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Nikitha Godishala murder: US set to issue 'Red Notice' for accused ex-boyfriend Arjun Sharma who fled to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nikitha-godishala-murder-us-set-to-issue-red-notice-for-accused-ex-boyfriend-arjun-sharma-who-fled-to-india/articleshow/126342534.cms,"



Howard County police are searching for 26-year-old Arjun Sharma after he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend and fled US for India. Police say Sharma is wanted on first and second-degree murder charges in connection with the death of 27-year-old Nikitha Godishala of Ellicott City.According to police, Sharma reported on New Year’s Eve that he last saw Godishala at his apartment in Columbia and on January 2, he filed a missing persons complaint. Authorities later discovered he had left the country on a flight to India. A search was conducted in his apartment which revealed Godishala’s body. It had multiple stab wounds and other physical trauma.Detectives believe she was killed shortly after 7 pm on December 31, according to CBS News.""There was obviously some premeditation to be able to do this and then to flee the country, so that's what we have right now as far as charges,"" Howard County police spokesman Seth Hoffman told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren.Police are unsure whether the murder weapon has been recovered. Hoffman added, ""We are unaware of any previous calls for service or incidents involving the two of them. We do believe it wasn't uncommon that they would still meet each other and have communication after their relationship ended, but we don't have a motive right now as to why he would kill her.""Godishala’s friends said they got concerned when she stopped contacting them on New Year’s Eve. Some posted on social media asking about her whereabouts.Howard County Police are working with federal and international authorities to capture Sharma. ""The US Attorney's office works with Interpol, which is an international organization, and they will eventually issue what is known as a 'red notice'—basically an international arrest warrant,"" Hoffman said.They explained the 'red-notice' that would help in Sharma's arrest: ""From there, that goes out to all the countries that work with Interpol, which is close to 200 countries including India, so that will give Indian authorities information. They will begin to track him and hopefully arrest him. From there, it could take quite a bit of time to process and hopefully get him extradited.""India’s embassy released a statement on X acknowledging the crime: ""The Embassy is in contact with the family of Ms. Nikitha Godishala and is extending all possible consular assistance. The Embassy is also following up the matter with the local authorities.""","Arjun sharma, 26, is wanted on first and second-degree murder charges in connection with the death of 27-year-old nikitha godishala of ellicott city.
