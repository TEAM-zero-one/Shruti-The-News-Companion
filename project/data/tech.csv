IAF wants surveillance UAVs that can fly in stratosphere,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-wants-surveillance-uavs-that-can-fly-in-stratosphere/articleshow/120834560.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IAF now wants to acquire three high-altitude platform system (HAPS) aircraft, which are basically unmanned aerial vehicles or 'pseudo-satellites' that operate in the stratosphere for long durations on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.""Capable of operating at an altitude of about 20km, which is much higher than the flightpaths of commercial planes, the HAPS aircraft will be used for persistent ISR as well as act as airborne data relay for other unmanned platforms for electronic and communications intelligence,"" an officer said.Initiating the case for the three long-duration HAPS aircraft and associated equipment, amid heightened tensions with Pakistan as well as the lack of de-escalation along Line of Actual Control with China, IAF has issued an initial request for information (RFI) for vendors to submit their responses by June 20.HAPS aircraft, which are usually solar-powered, are considered much cheaper to deploy and operate than satellites. ""Capable of automatic take-off and landing, HAPS aircraft do not require launch vehicles or rockets like satellites. They can be deployed from different locations as well as repaired and maintained easily as compared to satellites,"" the officer said.While the armed forces are also pursuing the case for launch-on-demand satellites, IAF wants HAPS aircraft to have a minimum operational endurance of 48 hours with data links and telemetry range of at least 150 km in a ""line of sight"" environment.""The desirable Satcom (satellite communication) is at least 400 km,"" the RFI said. With a detection range of at least 50 km from the operating altitude, the aircraft should be compatible with electro-optical and infrared cameras as well as electronic and communication intelligence payloads. They should be capable of effectively operating even during night and low-visibility conditions. ""The complete delivery is expected to be completed in 18 months from the date of the contract,"" the RFI said.IAF is parallelly pursuing a case for three ISTAR (intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance) aircraft to provide accurate ""actionable intelligence"" acquired through synthetic aperture radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors.Under the much-touted Defence Technology and Trade Initiative between India and the US, which has largely failed to deliver till now, ISTAR platforms were among the different projects identified for co-development and co-production.","Iaf now wants to acquire three high-altitude platform system (haps) aircraft.

Corporate ties and shared history

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan .Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Chandra holt is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, ashley buchanan.

In a landmark modernization effort, the US Social Security Administration (SSA) is preparing to roll out a secure, digital method for Americans to access their Social Security numbers (SSNs) online. Starting in early summer 2025, individuals with a My Social Security account will be able to view their SSNs directly through the SSA portal.This initiative is aimed at reducing reliance on traditional paper-based cards, cutting wait times for replacements, and enhancing user convenience and security. The move reflects SSA’s broader goal of adapting to digital trends while safeguarding sensitive personal information in an increasingly cyber-connected world. As identity theft and administrative backlogs continue to pose challenges, this digital SSN access marks a critical shift in how Americans interact with their most essential federal identification number.Historically, Americans have had to rely on physical Social Security cards for documentation of their SSN. If a card was lost or stolen, individuals were required to request a replacement either by mail or in person—a process that could take days or even weeks. With this new enhancement, users of the My Social Security platform will be able to view their SSN online via smartphone or computer at any time.The SSA has confirmed that the digital SSN service will become available in early summer 2025. No specific date has been announced, but the rollout is expected to be nationwide and accessible to all users with verified My Social Security accounts.Despite this digital advancement, the SSA emphasizes that physical SSN cards will continue to be available for those who prefer or require them. Individuals who are less familiar with technology or need a paper version for specific institutions can still request and receive a card through traditional channels.The digital SSN feature is especially helpful for:Lee Dudek, SSA Acting Commissioner, stated:The initiative is part of a broader trend of federal agencies moving services online in an effort to reduce paperwork, cut administrative costs, and provide faster access to essential services.While this change only allows users to view their SSN, experts note that it may pave the way for broader digital identity services in the future. Such services could include digital versions of other federal IDs or benefits information, enabling more seamless interactions with government systems.To ensure the integrity of this new service, the SSA has incorporated a range of cybersecurity protections:The SSA advises users to:",Digital social security cards launching soon by ssa.

Punishment for Ashley Buchanan: More than just firing

Who is Chandra Holt

What Kohl told staff on Ashley Buchanan's sacking

Retail chain Kohl has reportedly fired its newly hired chief executive officer (CEO) after an investigation showed he had cut a “highly unusual"" business deal with a woman who had been his romantic partner. According to a report in Wall Street Journal, Ashley Buchanan directed Kohl’s to “engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest”. Kohl had hired Ashley Buchanan to lead the department store chain in November 2024.Specifically, the conflict involved Buchanan’s relationship with Chandra Holt, a former colleague at Walmart. According to a company filing that didn’t specifically name Holt, the vendor signed a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement with Kohl’s with unusually favorable terms. Kohl’s audit committee oversaw an investigation that found Buchanan had not disclosed the inappropriate vendor relationships.According to the WSJ report, Buchanan and Holt rose through the ranks at Walmart before leaving around the same time for senior positions at other retailers.Buchanan has not only lost his CEO job, he will also have to forfeit all equity awards from the company and be required to reimburse Kohl’s on a pro-rated basis for a signing award worth $2.5 million, according to securities filings.Holt is currently founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand infused with vitamins and minerals, according to her LinkedIn profile. Holt left Walmart in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus. In 2023, Holt became CEO of Beyond Inc. — the company that owns Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond — where she led the company for a year.Kohl’s named board member Michael Bender as interim CEO effective immediately. In an all-hands meeting on May 1, Bender and other Kohl’s executives “sought to reassure staffers,” but didn’t provide any additional details or take questions, the Journal reported.“This is not a moment we expected nor the outcome we wanted for the company and our associates, but it is the right decision for us,” Bender said, according to a recording reviewed by the Journal.","Kohl's fired ceo ashley buchanan after discovering a conflict of interest involving a business deal with chandra holt.

"UPS to lay off 20,000 jobs, shut down facilities as it reduces Amazon shipments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ups-to-lay-off-20000-employees-shut-down-facilities-as-it-reduces-amazon-shipments/articleshow/120739052.cms,"What UPS said about the 20,000 job cuts



“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”

""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,""

""These actions will enable us to expand our US Domestic operating margin and increase profitability.”

“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business,”

“Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision.”

United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon . The company announced that it expects the job cuts to take place this year and the facility closures, across both leased and owned sites, by June 30. UPS is still reviewing its network and may identify additional locations for shutdown. As per FactSet data, the company employs about 490,000 workers. The upcoming job cuts will reduce UPS’ workforce by slightly over 4%. This decision follows the company's announcement to cut 12,000 positions last year.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, a UPS spokesman said the job cuts reflect a 50% reduction in shipping volume from Amazon, its largest customer, combined with broader cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives as part of a major operational restructuring.On the other hand, union's general president Sean O'Brien told Reuters, ""UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 jobs under its current national master agreement with Teamsters. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.""In its recent regulatory filing, the company said that cuts are in ""connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.”UPS CEO Carol Tome said:This decision follows a slowdown in economic growth and mounting recession fears driven by Trump’s aggressive trade policies.Tome noted during the company's latest earnings call.UPS CFO Brian Dykes added:In January, UPS agreed with Amazon to reduce the volume it handles by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. Speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Tome noted that after nearly 30 years of partnership, the renewal of Amazon’s contract this year prompted a reassessment of the relationship.Tomé said at the time.Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson said to Reuters:In related news,","United parcel service (ups) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of june.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Africa's content moderators want compensation for job trauma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/africas-content-moderators-want-compensation-for-job-trauma/articleshow/120821311.cms,"Africa's content moderators want compensation for job trauma (Credits: AP)

Lack of psychological support?

Disturbing images hours on end

Kenya and the Philippines attract outsourced business processes

Will AI replace human content moderators?

The vast majority of Facebook and Instagram users never see disturbing content depicting scenes of torture, child abuse or murder on these platforms. That's thanks to content moderators, who constantly review content and delete inappropriate images and videos. Often, these content moderators are employed by subcontractors in countries of the Global South. Their line of work is extremely stressful and has drawn criticism for years.Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and its African subcontractors have faced numerous lawsuits over these practices. According to British daily The Guardian , lawyers are currently preparing for a lawsuit against Majorel , a company contracted by Meta to engage in content moderation.Content moderators working for Majorel in Ghana's capital Accra told The Guardian that they have suffered from depression, anxiety, insomnia, and substance abuse. They believe this is a direct result of their work as content moderators. They also claim that the psychological support offered to help process disturbing social media content was inadequate.Teleperformance, which owns Majorel, reportedly denies these accusations. According to The Guardian, the company employs its own mental health professionals, who are registered with the local supervisory authority. DW asked Majorel for comment yet received no reply. British NGO Foxglove is now preparing a lawsuit.This is not, meanwhile, the first lawsuit of this kind. Around two years ago, former Facebook moderators in Kenya's capital Nairobi filed a lawsuit against Meta and its subcontractors Sama (Samasource) and Majorel. They had been involved in union action to improve their working conditions and say they were unfairly dismissed and not rehired by Majorel, Reuters news agency reports.In September 2024, a court confirmed that Meta can be sued in Kenya, leading to further court cases and mediation proceedings. In the US, a class action lawsuit brought by former Facebook moderators ended in 2020 with a settlement of approximately $52 million (€45,7 million) in compensation for psychological damage.Mercy Mutemi, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the Kenya trial, told Reuters such lawsuits are a ""wake-up call"" for tech companies to take a stronger stance against human rights violations.Some former content moderators are speaking out about their experiences at work, although employees often sign confidentiality agreements. News platform netzpolitik.org has reported that content moderators employed by one subcontractor spent eight to ten hours a day reviewing disturbing content, some of which showed scenes of animal cruelty and executions.A former content moderator working for a subcontractor told The Guardian ""the system doesn't allow us to skip it … we have to look at it for 15 seconds, at least."" The man also said he felt himself gradually becoming ""out of humanity."" The Guardian report was produced together with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.Another former employee, who is now involved in the African Tech Workers Rising coalition, told The Guardian about working under intense time pressure: ""You could not stop if you saw something traumatic. You could not stop for your mental health.""The former content moderator said she believes the situation has since deteriorated further, with employees forced to watch videos at two to three times the normal speed, on several screens at once.Foxglove NGO also reports that some content moderators had to ask for permission to leave their computer screens and that sometimes, this request was denied. The organization says content moderation is particularly stressful for people from conflict regions, who are in constant fear they may recognize relatives and friends in images they are asked to review. DW was, however, unable to verify whether these allegations are justified.A communications agency commissioned by Meta told DW that Meta had entered into contractual agreements with its content moderator companies. It said these agreements are intended to ensure that moderators receive professional training as well as access to professional support and medical care around the clock. The communications agency also said content moderator companies are obliged to pay above-average salaries and respect the right to organize.It is no coincidence that many subcontractors who offer content moderation services for large social media platforms are based in developing countries, where wages are generally significantly lower than in Western countries, occupational safety standards poorer, and youth unemployment is high. In addition, different time zones ensure that content moderation can be provided around the clock.""Large tech companies like to outsource important but burdensome work to Africa. They do this in a colonial and exploitative manner,"" Mercy Mutemi told netzpolitik.org.In late 2023, she told DW that ""Facebook and Sama are luring young, talented but vulnerable, unsuspecting young people from Kenya and other African countries.""The countries themselves benefit from business process outsourcing (BPO), which is a lucrative business. In spring 2024, Kenyan President William Ruto announced plans to expand the infrastructure to attract further BPO, aiming to create one million new BPO jobs over the next five years.Kenya's capital Nairobi is already considered an up-and-coming IT hub aptly nicknamed ""Silicon Savannah,"" boasting a young and well-educated population with good English language skills. Countries such as Rwanda and Ghana are also keen to grow their tech sectors. The Philippines and India, meanwhile, are also big players in the tech world.It is still difficult to predict what working conditions will look like in the future. Even though artificial intelligence (AI) is already widely used, experts believe that it will not be able to completely replace human labor. For example, algorithms will not always reliably recognize images of torture and abuse. Linguistic and cultural differences also remain a problem for AI.The only real solution, therefore, is to invest in human content moderators already doing this work, Foxglove director Martha Dark told The Guardian.","Africa's content moderators want compensation for job trauma.

The hidden cost of Indonesia's nickel boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-hidden-cost-of-indonesias-nickel-boom/articleshow/120820066.cms,"The hidden cost of Indonesia's nickel boom (Credits: AP)

Where it all began

The complexities of tracking Kawasi nickel

And IPO and efforts to conceal contamination

A billion dollars but no reliable drinking water

What happens now?

In the heart of Obi — a forested, mountainous island in northeastern Indonesia once known for its spices and quiet fishing settlements — life used to revolve around sago groves and clean rivers. Locals drank the clear, fast-running water directly from streams and springs.But when a nickel mine was opened, things began to change.""The water tastes different now and sometimes there are bubbles. It gives us stomach aches,"" says local resident Nurhayati Jumadi. ""But I can't afford bottled water, so we still drink from the spring.""In research coordinated by the investigative outlets Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and The Gecko Project, thousands of leaked internal emails and reports were made available by the transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets. The documents clearly show the Obi village of Kawasi was subjected to systematic pollution at the hands of Indonesia’s Harita Group for more than a decade — starting in 2012. DW and other partners were granted access to these documents, which they analyzed over several months.The Harita Group natural resources conglomerate runs a sprawling mining and smelting complex around Kawasi supplying nickel for electric vehicle batteries sold across Europe, China, and the United States. But the local population pays a high environmental price.The Harita Group started extracting nickel on the island in 2010 through its subsidiary PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (PT TBP), controlled by the Indonesian billionaire Lim Hariyanto. The first signs of pollution were detected soon thereafter.As early as 2012, internal emails flagged contamination from hexavalent chromium or chromium 6 (Cr6) — a highly toxic chemical and known carcinogen — in the Tugaraci river downstream of the mining site. The local community used the river for drinking, fishing and bathing.The company's now director of health, safety and environment, Tonny Gultom, explicitly identified mining and factory runoff as the pollution source.Cr6 is regulated worldwide, including in Indonesia which stipulates that drinking water cannot contain more than 50 micrograms per liter — roughly a drop in an Olympic-sized pool. Yet the information in the internal communication was not shared with residents, who stood to be impacted.Instead, it was sent quietly up the chain. In one 2017 mail marked ‘for your eyes only', Harita's then general manager of government relations and compliance, forwarded company directors a mail in which Gultom warned of an ""increasing trend"" towards Cr6 contamination, clearly citing ""active mining"" as the cause.A lack of data makes it impossible to pinpoint exactly when the pollution started showing up in a Kawasi spring used by villagers, but Harita's internal testing seen by DW confirms contamination in 2022. One result reveals levels 19 times higher than the legal threshold.Meanwhile, the global electric vehicle market was starting to surge. By 2021, EV sales had jumped by 109% over 12 months, signaling a booming demand for battery minerals like nickel.That same year, Harita expanded its operations around Kawasi, partnering with Chinese metals giant Lygend to launch Indonesia's first High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) plant a facility that converts low-grade nickel for use in EV batteries.Sale agreements and shipping records reviewed by DW show Harita supplying nickel to key players in the battery material industry. These companies, in turn, feed the world's major battery manufacturers and eventually, global automakers.Knowing where the nickel ends up matters because carmakers and battery producers have pledged to source materials responsibly and to avoid environmental harm in their supply chains.As raw materials from different sources are mixed together along the supply chain, tracing the nickel from Obi Island to a specific electric car is extremely difficult. We reached out to every major company we could identify from available shipping and corporate records to verify their supply chain links.Mercedes-Benz was the only automaker to confirm that its EVs contain nickel from Obi Island, saying it was aware of water contamination issues in 2022 and had taken action with what it described as ""solid"" results. But did not offer further details.Other car companies said they conduct due diligence and require ethical sourcing from suppliers, but did not confirm any ties to Obi Island, noting they do not source materials directly from mines.In 2023, as the boom in EVs continued, Harita began preparing to list its nickel subsidiary on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. And the pressure to conceal contamination intensified.In due diligence documents submitted to banks including BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, and Citigroup, Harita claimed its water quality met legal standards. But documents analyzed by DW show internal tests from just weeks earlier flagged excessive Cr6 concentrations — not only at the Kawasi spring but across wastewater sites.Equally, an environmental audit commissioned by Harita as part of the IPO (initial public offering) process noted poor treatment facilities, incomplete data and chemical indicators breaching groundwater standards. Nevertheless, the IPO went ahead, raising $660 million (€600 million).Despite repeated DW requests for comment, the Harita Group, Gultom, and other company executives, had not responded by the time of publication.Indonesia has become the world's largest supplier of nickel, accounting for nearly 60% of global output. Six percent of that comes from Kawasi, whose residents no longer live in a pristine village, but in the shadow of an industrial city. And a wealthy one at that.In 2023, Harita's nickel operations generated over $1 billion in revenue. Yet the region of North Maluku, where Obi is located, has one of Indonesia's highest poverty rates. And Kawasi itself even lacks reliable access to clean water.""If you have money, you buy bottled water. If not, you drink what's there,"" said Mann Noho, a former Harita worker. ""Whether it is healthy or not.""The villagers interviewed say they have never been warned by Harita about water contamination. Indeed several internal company emails show that officials actively discouraged sharing pollution data with locals. And the community has not been provided with an alternative water supply.""They let us drink it knowing it's polluted,"" said local resident Nurhayati Jumadi. ""That means they are letting us die.""The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), a respected auditing body, is currently reviewing Harita Nickel for certification. IRMA's executive director Aimee Boulanger told DW she is hoping to change things for the better. ""We're not here to give green stars,"" she said. ""We're here to shift industry expectations.""Laode Syarif, a former commissioner of Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) who saw a redacted version of the documents which revealed no names, said the contamination and efforts to conceal it could lead to criminal prosecution under environmental law. ""The government must act,"" he said.There are existing legal examples around Cr6 pollution. Not least the 1996 case that saw the US utility company PG&E ordered to pay $333 million in damages after the carcinogen was found in the water in Hinkley, California. It was one of the largest civil settlements in the country's history and led to cleanup efforts and stricter regulations.More recently, nickel mines on the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Halmahera — as well as other sites — have come under pressure from citizens to clean up and pay compensation for their activities. And now environmental groups like JATAM, which highlights the environmental and social impacts of nickel mining, are working with Kawasi residents to demand action including long-term health assessments and alternative water supplies.""If I had known that it was contaminated with cancerogenic compounds, I wouldn't have drunk it,"" said Nurhayati. ""We have to demand that the company act so we can get clean water.""Eli Moskowitz from OCCRP and Alon Aviram from nonprofit investigative newsroom,The Gecko Project, contributed their findings to this report. An Indonesian journalist who cannot be named for security reasons also contributed reporting.","Indonesia's harita group runs a sprawling mining and smelting complex around kawasi. The company supplies nickel for electric vehicle batteries sold across europe, china, and the u.s. But the local population pays a high environmental price.

Open till 7pm? RBI panel calls for extending money market hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/open-till-7pm-rbi-panel-calls-for-extending-money-market-hours/articleshow/120836433.cms,"MUMBAI: With UPI and other digital rails keeping money in motion round-the-clock - and India's markets becoming more entwined with global ones - an RBI panel has proposed extending money market hours to 7pm from 5pm. The shift would give banks greater flexibility in managing short-term liquidity and accessing interbank and central bank funds.The recommendations come from a working group set up to review trading and settlement hours across RBI-regulated markets. The panel argued that trading hours shape how efficiently markets function, affecting liquidity, volatility, and price discovery. Since the last major review in 2019, India's financial markets expanded in size and complexity, with more participants, a broader range of products, and increased non-resident activity-especially in govt securities and derivatives following regulatory and index changes. Tighter links between onshore and offshore markets, advances in trading infrastructure, and round-the-clock payment systems altered liquidity dynamics, prompting the need to revisit market timings, the panel said.In money markets, the panel proposed extending call money trading to 7pm, with the reporting window for such transactions to close at 7:30pm. It also recommended that market repo and triparty repo (TREP) trade until 4pm, an hour later than the current close.In line with the trading extension, the settlement window for repo deals would shift to 5:30-6:30pm.To align market operations at the start of the day, the panel suggested moving forward the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) auction to 9.30-10am. Fine-tuning operations would continue at the central bank's discretion throughout the day.",The shift would give banks greater flexibility in managing short-term liquidity and accessing interbank and central bank funds.

This was driven by the fastest upturn in exports in 14 years, possibly triggered by production shift to India against the backdrop of global trade tensions.Despite rising marginally from 58.1 in March to 58.2 in April, the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) showed the strongest improvement in the health of the sector in ten months. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction in the survey, which is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 400 manufacturing firms.Sub-sector data showed robust expansions, with the fastest increase registered at consumer goods makers. A key factor contributing to the latest improvement in output growth was a sharp rise in new business. Respondents attributed growth to better domestic and international demand. With the sole exception of Jan, new business from overseas grew to the greatest extent in over 14 years at the start of the 2025-26 fiscal year. Participants cited Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas as the key areas for robust demand.""The notable increase in new export orders in April may indicate a potential shift in production to India, as businesses adapt to the evolving trade landscape and US tariff announcements,"" said Pranjul Bhandari , chief India economist at HSBC","Growth momentum in the country's manufacturing sector improved in april.
