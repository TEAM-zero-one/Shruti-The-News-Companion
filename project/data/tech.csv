Anna Congdon’s Old Tweets Spark Controversy Just Before the Super Bowl

“I ain’t saying she a gold digger, but she ain’t messin’ with no broke n—gas.”

“#Replace A DisneyMovieWithN—. The Cheetah N—.”

“S—t, you’re right. It’s The Cheetah Girls #TheCheetahN—S.”

“thoroughly enjoyed calling my mom n-gga.”

The Internet Reacts—Criticism, Defenses, and Calls for Saquon Barkley to Stay Focused

Timing is Everything—Why Is This Resurfacing Now?

The internet has a long memory, and right now, it’s turning against Anna Congdon , fiancée of Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley . Just as the NFL world shifts its focus to the upcoming Super Bowl, Congdon has found herself at the center of controversy.Old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, and they’re sparking major backlash online.The posts, which reportedly contain racial slurs—including the N-word in Disney movie titles—have ignited a wave of criticism, with many questioning her past actions and calling for accountability. Social media users wasted no time in digging up the problematic content, leading to heated discussions about whether past mistakes should define a person today.Screenshots from 2012 and 2013, when Congdon was around 13 years old, have been making rounds online, showing her casually using offensive language in tweets. Some of the resurfaced posts include:A play on Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” lyrics, where she wrote,A hashtag game where she swapped words in Disney movie titles with racial slurs, such asWhen a friend pointed out she should add an “s,” she doubled down, replying,A tweet from 2013 where she said sheThis isn’t the first time these tweets have surfaced. Back in 2018, when the controversy initially blew up, Congdon swiftly deleted most of her Twitter history before 2015. However, with screenshots resurfacing now, the internet is once again divided. Some are calling her out for the language, while others argue that these were tweets from her teenage years and should be left in the past.Another major talking point? Her biracial children. Some commenters are now questioning whether she still uses such language in private, especially around her kids. Meanwhile, Barkley’s supporters are urging him to ignore the drama and focus on his Super Bowl run.Interestingly, the timing of this scandal isn’t random. It comes just as Congdon’s recent engagement to Barkley was revealed—though reports say the proposal actually happened six months ago. Whether the timing is a coincidence or calculated, the controversy is stealing headlines right before one of the biggest moments in Barkley’s career.For now, neither Barkley nor Congdon has publicly addressed the resurfaced tweets. But in the world of social media, nothing stays buried forever.Also read - Bill Belichick & Jordon Hudson Spark Engagement Rumors with Two Rings—She Addresses One, But What About the Other?","Anna congdon’s old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced.

Thousands of PlayStation users faced widespread connectivity issues on Friday evening as the PlayStation Network (PSN) experienced a severe global outage. The disruption, which began at approximately 5:20 PM ET, left many gamers unable to access online services, log into their accounts, or make purchases on the PlayStation Store. Reports of server failures surged, reaching their peak at 5:49 PM ET, with Down Detector registering over 68,000 complaints within a short period.The outage led to significant frustration among players, particularly as it occurred during peak gaming hours when many users were returning home from work or school.A large percentage of affected users reported issues with server connectivity, while others faced difficulties logging into their PlayStation accounts. Sony acknowledged the disruption on its official PlayStation Network status page, stating that they were aware of the issue and working to resolve it as soon as possible. However, no official explanation has been provided regarding the cause of the outage or a timeframe for full service restoration. This unexpected downtime has left many gamers unable to access their favorite multiplayer games, cloud saves, and digital content, leading to widespread speculation about whether the issue was caused by maintenance, a technical glitch, or a more significant underlying problem.The outage disrupted essential PlayStation services, preventing users from engaging in various online activities. Many players reported being unable to log into their PSN accounts, access their friends lists, or join multiplayer games. Online-based titles such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto Online, EA FC 24, and Destiny 2 were rendered inaccessible, leaving competitive gamers particularly frustrated.Additionally, players attempting to make purchases on the PlayStation Store encountered difficulties, with transactions failing or the store failing to load entirely. Some users also experienced issues with their cloud saves and game updates, which rely on PlayStation’s online infrastructure to sync data across devices. Error messages such as ""PlayStation Network is currently undergoing maintenance (WS-37432-9)"" appeared frequently, giving users no choice but to either dismiss the message or visit PlayStation’s support page for updates.The PlayStation Network outage was not limited to a specific device, as players on PS5, PS4, PS3, and PS Vita all reported experiencing connectivity issues. The disruption also extended beyond consoles, affecting PlayStation’s web-based services, including PlayStation Direct and the PlayStation mobile app. This meant that users who attempted to manage their accounts, purchase digital content, or check their subscription details were also unable to do so.As the outage impacted regions worldwide, it led to disruptions across multiple time zones, affecting both casual gamers and esports players alike. The inability to access online game modes, leaderboards, and competitive matches added to the frustration, as many gamers rely on PlayStation’s network for their daily entertainment. The timing of the outage, occurring on a weekend evening, made it even more inconvenient for players who had planned gaming sessions with friends or were looking forward to special in-game events.As soon as users began encountering issues, reports of the outage surged on Down Detector, a platform that tracks real-time connectivity problems across various online services. By 6:00 p.m. ET, nearly 70,000 complaints had been logged, confirming the widespread nature of the disruption. Many gamers also turned to social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, to voice their frustration, share updates, and speculate on possible causes behind the outage.PSN acknowledged the ongoing issues on X, stating, “We are aware that some users may currently be experiencing difficulties with PSN.” Following this confirmation, frustrated gamers across the country took to social media to voice their complaints.One user on X expressed their frustration, saying, “I pay for a yearly subscription just to deal with this—do you even know what you’re doing?” Another user criticized the situation, writing, “Every user is facing issues. What a joke. We can’t even play the games we purchased.”A third user, visibly upset, wrote, “I’m sick and just trying to play, but you always ruin everything. It’s been over eight hours—fix it already!” Another echoed similar concerns, stating, “This is ridiculous—over 12 hours and still no access. What am I even paying for with PS Plus?”The service disruption occurred during peak hours when numerous gamers were logging in after work or school, anticipating access to PlayStation's online features. Players experienced difficulties connecting to their friends lists, navigating account management sections, and completing transactions on the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Direct. Sony addressed the issue on the official PlayStation Network site, assuring users,","Playstation network outage disrupts online gaming, store access, and cloud services.

LONDON: Thames Water , which serves 16 million customers in and around London, is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding to prevent the cash-strapped company from falling into government administration.The high court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90 per cent of the company's debt have already backed the deal.Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35 per cent increase in Thames Water's consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53 per cent in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.The company has until February 18 to appeal the decision.","Thames water is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding.

BEIJING: China's sluggish domestic consumption got a boost over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday , with travel and retail sales both offering a slight reprieve to a dragging economy facing the prospect of an escalating US trade war.Train stations and airports across the country were jam-packed for weeks as millions returned home for the festive period in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.Official data showed there were 500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period, commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said Thursday.That's a 5.9 per cent jump from the same period last year, when travel numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels.Meanwhile, sales of ""key retail and catering services nationwide"" were also up, by 4.1 per cent compared to last year, He Yongqian told reporters in Beijing.The government has struggled to get China's billion-strong army of consumers to inject cash into the economy as a prolonged real estate crisis weighs on confidence.But last month, policymakers expanded a subsidy scheme for common household items, from water purifiers and refrigerators to laptops and electric vehicles.During the holiday period, sales of household appliances and communication equipment at ""key monitored retail enterprises"" were up more than 10 percent year-on-year, according to the commerce ministry.China recorded five per cent growth in gross domestic product last year, among the slowest in decades.Beijing will likely look to hit the same goal of ""around five per cent"" in 2025 but that could be hindered by threats of an escalating trade war.At the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs of 10 percent on all Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back immediately with tariffs of its own, targeting coal and gas.","500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period.

Following this, a group of banks and financial service trade associations formed fTLD Registry Services to operate the 'bank gTLD'.The 'bank.in' domain launched in 2015, providing a verified and more secure online presence for banks worldwide.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
