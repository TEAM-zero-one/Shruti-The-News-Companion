Base Salary: $2 million

Stock Awards & Other Compensation: Majority of his earnings

Security Expenses: Alphabet spent $8.27 million on Pichai’s personal security, marking a 22% increase from the previous year

Google spends 22% more on CEO Sundar PIchai's security

Google’s parent company Alphabet has revealed CEO Sundar Pichai’s earnings for the year 2024. As per Alphabet’s 2025 Proxy Statement, Sundar Pichai’s total compensation for the year 2024 is $10.72 million. This figure reveals a significant decrease as compared to his $226 million earnings of 2022. This drop is mainly attributed to the absence of a large triennial stock award that Pichai received in the previous reporting period. While the overall compensation saw a considerable reduction, details of the breakdown reveal a base salary of $2 million for Pichai. The remaining portion of his 2024 package consisted of stock awards and other compensation.While his base salary remained steady at $2 million (₹16 crore), the majority of Pichai's $10.73 million compensation package consisted of stock-based rewards, along with bonuses and other executive perks. Also, a significant allocation of $8.27 million was designated towards Pichai's personal security expenses. This represents a 22% increase in security-related spending compared to the $6.7 million allocated in 2023.The Proxy Statement also revealed that Google paid $8.27 million for CEO Sundar Pichai’s personal security in 2024. The figure is up almost 22% from $6.78 million in 2023. The increase reportedly came as Pichai travelled extensively in 2024. In a proxy statement with the securities exchange, the company said “In 2024, Sundar’s security arrangements included residential security and consultation fees, security monitoring services, car and driver services, and personal security during all travel.”“We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders, as they mitigate risks to our business,” it further added. In the document, the company says that “we do not consider these additional security arrangements to be a personal benefit to Sundar because they arise from the nature of his employment responsibilities.”","Google's parent company alphabet has revealed ceo sundar pichai’s earnings for the year 2024.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

‘rawdog’ morning routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-calledhas recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Mark zuckerberg follows the ‘rawdog’ routine, know what it is and how it works.

"Warren Buffett plans to retire by year’s end, recommends Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-plans-to-retire-by-years-end-recommends-greg-abel-as-his-successor-to-lead-berkshire-hathaway/articleshow/120857738.cms,"Warren Buffett on Saturday announced his plans to retire by the end of the year recommending Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway.""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,” Buffett said.He announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting , declining to take questions on the decision. He revealed that only his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, were aware beforehand, while Greg Abel- seated beside him on stage- had no prior notice.While many investors believe Abel is well-suited to lead Berkshire Hathaway, questions remain about his investment acumen. Buffett reinforced his confidence in Abel by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.Further adding in his statement revealing that he'll retain his shareholding and lending support to Abel, the billionaire investor added, ""I have no intention - zero - of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually.""“The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,"" he further said, justifying his decision.Investors, numbering in thousands at the Omaha venue, rose to their feet in extended applause to honour Buffett's six-decade leadership of the company.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert observed that Buffett's decision to step aside would not have been straightforward. ""This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,"" Seifert said. ""I think there will be an effort at maintaining a 'business as usual' environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.""Investors such as Steven Check, who manages Check Capital Management, said that they remain confident about succession plans due to Abel's proven track record and Berkshire's self-sustaining business model. Buffett has indicated that Abel's management style could be more involved than his own, potentially enhancing the performance of Berkshire's portfolio companies. ""I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be that a good thing,"" Check said.Addressing the crowd at the shareholders meeting before announcing the retirement plans, Buffett had also cautioned about the severe global repercussions of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors present that “trade should not be a weapon,” while acknowledging that “there’s no question trade can be an act of war.”“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he added.Also read: Warren Buffett warns against using 'trade as a weapon', slams tariff tactics at Berkshire AGM This comes as Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway reported significantly lower profits Saturday morning, posting just over one-third of last year’s earnings—moments before thousands of shareholders poured into an Omaha arena to hear from the legendary investor himself. The decline in profits was primarily attributed to a significant decrease in Berkshire's investment valuations and insurance losses of $860 million, stemming from policies issued by Geico and other insurance subsidiaries before the severe Southern California wildfires.Berkshire's first-quarter net earnings decreased to $4.6 billion ($3,200 per Class A share) from $12.7 billion ($8,825 per Class A share) in the corresponding period of the previous year.Buffett consistently advises investors to concentrate on operating earnings, which exclude the fluctuations in investment values. Although Berkshire must report these investment changes regardless of stock sales, these variations can obscure the actual performance of its operations.The operating earnings experienced a 14% reduction, reaching $9.6 billion ($6,703.41 per Class A share), compared to $11.2 billion ($7,796.47 per share) in the previous year. This performance fell short of FactSet Research's projection of $7,076.90 per Class A share.Notwithstanding the earnings reduction, the Q&A session with Buffett continues to be the highlight of Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend. Investors are particularly interested in understanding the reasons behind the company's unprecedented cash holdings of $347.7 billion, an increase from $334.2 billion at the conclusion of 2024.Read more: Buffett's Berkshire sees profit fall amid wildfire losses, draws thousands to Omaha meeting","Buffett announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour q&a session during the annual shareholder meeting.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Church donation box goes digital in Greece,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/church-donation-box-goes-digital-in-greece/articleshow/120873560.cms,"AP File Photo

ATHENS: Devout regulars attending Athens's main Roman Catholic church that honours a first-century saint have discovered a 21st-century update: their donation box is now hooked up to a digital payments system.The addition of the Point of Sale (POS) device in the Cathedral Basilica of St Dionysius the Areopagite is the first in a Greek church, even though their use is common elsewhere, including in Africa.Such was the stir created in Orthodox-dominated Greece that cameras from national broadcasters were on hand Sunday, trained on the POS's small screen -- even though it was not yet switched on.The unit was expected to be working within a week, accepting card-tap donations as small as one cent, up to a limit of 1,000 euros ($1,130).It was sitting on a wooden furniture unit alongside prayer candles that could be exchanged for donations.""The first church donation box with POS: Tourists requested it, the Church made it happen"", said an article on the protothema.gr news website.The cathedral's priest, Georgios Dangas, noted mildly that churches elsewhere in the Western world had been using POS units for decades.""We have been asked to install a POS by tourists coming to Athens. Worshippers from all over the world who travel without cash want to give something for the church,"" he told AFP.He added that the expenses of running the church, the salaries of the priests and the charity work are not paid by either the Greek state or the Vatican, so the contributions were vital.Sunday mass in the church is frequently attended by women from the Philippines who work in the homes of the rich who live in nearby upscale neighbourhoods.The POS device, which was hotly debated in Greece and on social media over the weekend, may find imitators in the Orthodox Church, the most followed religion in Greece.""The man who installed it told me that priests from Orthodox churches also contacted him. But they said let's see how it goes in the Catholic Church and then we'll see,"" the priest said.","Point of sale (pos) device in the cathedral basilica of st dionysius the areopagite.

US solar tariffs could drive Asia transition boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/us-solar-tariffs-could-drive-asia-transition-boom/articleshow/120865269.cms,"Presentative Photo (Photo:AP)

Tariffs 'accelerate' transition

BANGKOK: Massive planned US duties on solar panels made in Southeast Asia could be a chance for the region to ramp up its own long-stalled energy transition , experts say.Earlier this month, Washington announced plans for hefty duties on solar panels made in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.The levies follow an investigation, launched before US President Donald Trump took office, into ""unfair practices"" in the countries, particularly by Chinese-headquartered firms.If approved next month, they will pile upon tariffs already imposed by the Trump administration, including blanket 10-percent levies for most countries, and 145 percent on Chinese-made goods.For the US market, the consequences are likely to be severe. China makes eight out of every 10 solar panels globally, and controls 80 percent of every stage of the manufacturing process.The new tariffs ""will practically make solar exports to US impossible commercially"", said Putra Adhiguna, managing director at the Energy Shift Institute think tank.Southeast Asia accounted for nearly 80 percent of US solar panel imports in 2024.And while investment in solar production has ramped up in the United States in recent years, the market still relies heavily on imported components.For Chinese manufacturers, already dealing with a saturated domestic market, the raft of tariffs is potentially very bad news.Many shifted operations to Southeast Asia hoping to avoid punitive measures imposed by Washington and the European Union as they try to protect and nurture domestic solar industries.The proposed new duties range from around 40 percent for some Malaysian exports to an eye-watering 3,521 percent for some Cambodia-based manufacturers.But there may be a silver lining for the region, explained Ben McCarron, managing director at Asia Research & Engagement.""The tariffs and trade war are likely to accelerate the energy transition in Southeast Asia,"" he said.China will ""supercharge efforts"" in regional markets and push for policy and implementation plans to ""enable fast adoption of green energy across the region"", driven by its exporters.Analysts have long warned that countries in the region are moving too slowly to transition from planet-warming fossil fuels like coal.""At the current pace, it (Southeast Asia) risks missing out on the opportunities provided by the declining costs of wind and solar, now cheaper than fossil fuels,"" said energy think tank Ember in a report last year.For example, Malaysia relied on fossil fuels for over 80 percent of its electricity generation last year.It aims to generate 24 percent from renewables by 2030, a target that has been criticised as out of step with global climate goals.The tariff regime represents a double opportunity for the region, explained Muyi Yang, senior energy analyst at Ember.So far, the local solar industry has been ""largely opportunistic, focused on leveraging domestic resources or labour advantages for export gains"", he told AFP.Cut off from the US market, it could instead focus on local energy transitions, speeding green energy uptake locally and driving a new market that ""could serve as a natural hedge against external volatility"".Still, replacing the US market will not be easy, given its size and the relatively nascent state of renewables in the region.""Success hinges on turning this export-led momentum into a homegrown cleantech revolution,"" said Yang.""Clearance prices"" may be attractive to some, but countries in the region and beyond may also be cautious about a flood of solar, said Adhiguna.Major markets like Indonesia and India already have measures in place intended to favour domestic solar production.""Many will hesitate to import massively, prioritising trade balance and aims to create local green jobs,"" he said.","Washington announced plans for hefty duties on solar panels made in cambodia, vietnam, thailand and malaysia.

Varun Beverages Ltd delivered strong 1QCY24 performance with 29% YoY revenue growth, driven by robust 30% volume growth (15.5% organic). While margins remained flat YoY at 22.7% due to lower-margin South Africa consolidation, domestic demand stayed healthy with double-digit growth. Management remains confident in long-term double-digit volume growth, supported by distribution expansion (visi-coolers) and a shift towards healthier beverages (nimbooz +100% YoY). International markets, though margin-dilutive, offer scale-up potential. We maintain BUY (55x CY26E EPS), projecting 18%/16%/26% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs over CY25-26. As PepsiCo’s key franchisee, VBL is well-placed to capitalize on India’s underpenetrated beverage market and rural refrigeration growth.JSW Infrastructure concluded FY25 with strong growth in cargo volumes of 117Mn tons (+9% YoY). Revenue rose 19% YoY to ₹44.8Bn, while APAT grew ~22% YoY, reflecting steady progress toward its 400 MTPA port capacity goal by FY30.Boosted by Navkar acquisition, the logistics segment targets ₹80b revenue by FY30. With a strong balance sheet and positive outlook, the company is poised to benefit from India’s infrastructure growth and rising third-party cargo demand despite global headwinds. We expect JSWINFRA to strengthen its market dominance, leading to 13% volume CAGR over FY25-27. This, along with a sharp rise in logistics revenues, is expected to drive revenue/EBITDA/APAT CAGR of 22%/23%/18% over FY25-27.","According to motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting may 5, 2025) are varun beverages and jsw infrastructure.

BENGALURU: Even as the professional landscape reflects a growing synergy between human and autonomous agents, Arundhati Bhattacharya, president & CEO of Salesforce - South Asia, said the advent of this synergy created new job roles, including unstructured engineers, ML engineers, and prompt engineers.She said that while the transition might cause some pain in the industry with some skills made redundant, it would eventually lead to the creation of new employment opportunities. ""There will be some pain in transition. There always is. But at the end of the day, you will find many new jobs being created, jobs that were not there at all. We didn't know about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) till recently. We didn't have this many ethics officers or compliance officers. So, the nature of jobs will change,"" Bhattacharya said here on Friday.Last year, Salesforce unveiled its autonomous AI application, Agentforce, which provides specialised support to employees or customers. Agentforce interacts with customers through multiple channels around the clock in natural language. It defines security guardrails and knows when to seamlessly escalate to human employees.""Agentforce will allow humans to become more human.Instead of wasting time on my screen replying to repetitive stuff, those can be done by the agent while I call a client and talk to them. I use agentic AI in my work life, which assists me in summarising calls and getting the transcript when we are not able to be present on the calls. We have a lot of training sessions, and we were required to pitch to our peers to confirm that the training was complete. Agentforce doesn't give me passing marks just because I'm the boss. It tells me exactly where my tone went wrong and where my language was incorrect. It's very objective,"" Bhattacharya said.Currently, 30% of the code is written by agents. Arun Parameswaran, EVP & MD of sales at Salesforce South Asia , said that 50% of the code will be done by agents by the end of this year. Salesforce's Agentforce, an AI platform that allows organisations to create and deploy autonomous AI agents , has an accuracy of 93% for a European airline client. Regarding Salesforce's own helpline, 84% of the queries are being answered by agents, and the escalation has been reduced by 50%.Among Salesforce's clients is Air India, which recently adopted Agentforce to enhance its user interface. It claims that the refund process of the airline has been drastically reduced with the use of Agentforce.The current macroeconomic stress induced by the tariff wars has not impacted the business, but its clients are in a wait-and-watch mode, Parameswaran said. India continues to be a critical growth market for Salesforce, and the company's expanding investment in the region reflects this commitment. Salesforce has an online learning platform called Trailhead. Its Trailblazer community - including developers, admins, architects, IT leaders, and customer innovators - has over 3.9 million members across India.","Arundhati bhattacharya, president & ceo of salesforce - south asia, said the advent of this synergy created new job roles.

Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Indian Oil with a target price of Rs 170. Analysts said the OMC major beat analysts’ estimates during its Jan-March quarters on several parameters on the back of better marketing margins and refinery inventory gains. The management indicated that FY26 is healthy so far, with stable refining and marketing boosted by lower oil prices. IOCL is engaging with the GoI for LPG compensation as well. Major projects like Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni expansions would progressively commission during the next two years.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on State Bank of India with a target price of Rs 915. Analysts said the banking major reported in-line earnings as higher provisions and opex were offset by higher other income, while margins were broadly stable. The bank’s management expects NIM to remain under pressure due to the rate cuts. However, the bank has some offsetting levers like an increase in CD ratio, a higher MCLR-linked book, and yield benefits from the recent increase in MCLR rates. Credit grew 12% YoY, while the unsecured book (Xpress Credit) saw a flat trend. The bank has seen an increase in its domestic CD ratio. Fresh slippages were contained, which underscores improvements in underwriting standards.Citigroup has a ‘buy’ rating on Indus Towers with a target price of Rs 485. Analysts feel the key positives for the stock are that all the past undisputed overdues from Voda Idea have now been cleared. In addition, free cash flow generation rose in Jan-March quarter. And estimated new tenancies from Voda Idea rose on a quarterly basis. They said Indus Towers has, however, delayed the dividend announcement that was widely expected and has, instead, set up a committee for recommendations to “enhance shareholder returns”. They feel that this delay could weigh on near-term stock performance pending further clarity.Elara Securities India has reiterated its ‘reduce’ rating on CEAT with the target price at Rs 3,153. Analysts said during the Jan-March quarter CEAT’s revenue grew, led by healthy volume growth, while EBITDA margin growth was driven by contraction of raw material costs, and price hikes implemented across two-wheeler tyres. Analysts retained their cautious stance on the tyre sector, given a low EPS CAGR during FY24-FY27, and expectations of structurally high natural rubber prices during FY26-27. We are yet to factor in the CAMSO acquisition.ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on Nippon Life India Asset Management (Nippon Life Mutual Fund) with the target price at Rs 720. Analysts feel the fund house is one of the better plays on assets under management (AUM) basis industry position, execution track record and valuation. A strong retail franchise and good fund performance have driven market share gains for Nippon Life AMC in equity and SIP flows. The fund house also maintains its industry-leading position in the passive and alternate funds segment.","Emkay global financial services has a ‘buy’ rating on indian oil with a target price of rs 170.

SBI loan growth hit as cos use IPO funds to pare debt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-loan-growth-hit-as-cos-use-ipo-funds-to-pare-debt/articleshow/120884212.cms,"MUMBAI: SBI attributed a slowdown in loan growth to companies using equity issue proceeds to repay debt and deleverage. The country's largest bank projected credit growth of 14-16% for FY25 in Q2 but moderated its guidance in the next quarter to the lower end of that range. However, by the end of FY25, the bank's total advances rose 12% to cross Rs 42 lakh crore. Growth was weighed down by the corporate segment.Loans to small & medium enterprises rose 16.9% to over Rs 5 lakh crore, while agriculture loans grew 14.3%. Retail personal loans and corporate loans rose 11.4% and 9%, respectively. Home loans, which grew 14%, were the key driver of retail credit.Bank officials said many large central PSUs used equity funding to pare debt, leading to prepayments that couldn't be compensated within a quarter. ""We still have visibility in corporate credit. While we are not expecting 14-16% growth, 12-13% is quite possible as the industry is growing below 12%,"" an official said. In FY25, NTPC raised Rs 10,000 crore through an IPO.""Corporate is a bulky and chunky credit, and we had an unusual prepayment in that segment,"" SBI chairman C S Setty said during an analyst call. ""While we have a Rs 3.4-lakh-crore pipeline in corporate loans, unanticipated prepayments impacted growth.""The bank said credit demand was coming from infrastructure, renewable energy, data centres, and commercial realty.The official added the bank had Rs 1.7 lakh crore in sanctioned but undisbursed corporate loans. ""We hope there are no further prepayments. Broadly, we are sticking to a 12% growth target in the corporate book,"" the official said.On Saturday, SBI reported an 8.3% drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 19,600 crore for the March quarter from Rs 21,384 crore a year earlier, as net interest margins declined. Standalone profit fell to Rs 18,642 crore from Rs 20,698 crore.","The country's largest bank projected credit growth of 14-16% for fy25 in q2.

'US trade deal mother of all opportunities',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-trade-deal-mother-of-all-opportunities/articleshow/120884131.cms,"What is the impact of US tariffs on India's manufacturing ambitions?

People talk about Dixon as the next Foxconn. Do you think that scale can be developed?

Should we partner with suppliers from China, Vietnam and Taiwan?

Your view on China?

NEW DELHI: Dixon Electronics is seen as India's Foxconn and has grown its manufacturing footprint exponentially over the last few years, securing contract- manufacturing orders from some of the world's biggest giants. As Trump tariffs shake up the global manufacturing ecosystem, Dixon chairman Sunil Vachani tells TOI in an interview that ""There is no better place than India right now because we have a large pool of manpower, we give frugal and low-cost manufacturing, we offer high productivity, and all these are backed by strong govt incentives. "" Excerpts:To be honest, the initial opportunity that came our way was when Donald Trump was elected in his first term. Then, everybody was looking at an alternative to our neighbour (China). But, at that time, the Indian industry was not very well prepared and we missed that opportunity as Vietnam surged ahead. This time, the opportunity is much bigger and India is much better prepared. The four years of smartphone production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme helped the Indian industry create a very large scale. As Dixon, we were hardly producing a few million sets of smartphones per year until a few years back, but led by PLI, today we have a capacity to produce almost 70 million devices annually.Our industry's scale (in smartphones) today is comparable to what we see in our neighbouring country. Moreover, our industry is also investing in backward integration. If India really emerges as one of the first countries to have a bilateral trade agreement with the US with zero tariffs, this will be the mother of all opportunities.What do you need for creating a large scale? You need a large pool of trained manpower and modern machines and make sure to achieve the best productivity. India's strength lies in having a large pool of manpower, which is waiting to be employed. All the industry needs to do is invest resources to give requisite training and skills to these people, so that they become extremely productive.As an entrepreneur, if I go and try and reinvent the wheel and develop technologies on display and camera modules, it will take me a very long time. Unfortunately, our industry doesn't have time on our side. Last time we may have lost this opportunity, but this time we don't want to lose it. So, the quickest way and the most efficient way is to tie up with component suppliers, who are already vendors to our customers. We have to agree on a JV structure, which is acceptable to govt. Because security considerations are the most important factor. They will do their vetting, they will do due diligence, and only then will the projects get approved. So, after clearing those hurdles, any partnership that comes through will be a win-win because the Chinese are getting access to a market, which they are not going to have if the tariffs hit Beijing.If you see our story of smartphone manufacturing, we were broadly importers around ten years back or so. For us, this journey has just begun. China is far, far ahead of us in this journey. They've developed huge strengths, including in backward integration and component ecosystem. Over a period of time, we can do it on our own..","Dixon electronics is seen as india's foxconn and has grown its manufacturing footprint.
