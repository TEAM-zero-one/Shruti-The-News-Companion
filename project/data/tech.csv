Taking risks equals having fun, expressing yourself, being bold, and fearless

Ciara, the wife of Russell Wilson , is known for sporting bold fashion—from daring silhouettes like see-through gowns and body-hugging couture with thigh-high slits to biker jackets and faux-fur headpieces. She’s also known for being not a “regular mom” but a “cool mom” to her four children. In a recent interview with PEOPLE at True Religion’s Holiday Party, Ciara talked about taking risks with her fashion choices and whether she considers herself a cool mom to her four children.A PEOPLE interviewer asked the American singer: “Do you consider yourself a risk taker when it comes to fashion?”The 39-year-old mom-of-four said that fashion wouldn’t be fashion if there were no risks involved—“I think so, I think CiCi would like to take a little risk sometimes when it comes to fashion. I think fashion wouldn’t be fashion if you didn’t take risks. Sometimes, you may not get it right, but I think the risk is always worth it when it comes to fashion because it’s about having fun, it’s about expressing yourself, and it’s about being bold and fearless, so I, one hundred percent, yes, I’m a risk taker. ”A PEOPLE interviewer questioned the NFL WAG, “Do you identify as a cool mom? You’re a cool mom.”Ciara is known for wearing many hats at once—actress, dancer, record producer, singer, songwriter, fashion model, composer, and music video director.But when it comes to teaching her own kids, she learned a hard lesson. Her eldest son, Future, was recording a TikTok video with her, but when she tried to show him a few steps, he stopped her. “Mom, you don’t know what you’re talking about,” he told her.Ciara shared the humorous exchange: “You know, it's funny because my kids, you know especially my eldest, he’s reaching that stage where it’s like—we were doing a TikTok and I’m telling Future, do the dance like this, trust me, do your legs like this…and he’s like, ‘Mom, you don’t know what you’re talking about,’ I’m like, ‘Do you know who your Mama is, boy? Do you know your Mama will teach you all the dance moves that you need to know?’”The multifaceted mother further shared that her kids are reaching an age where they want to hold her hand as much anymore. But despite that, she feels she’s ‘tapped in’ with her kids, alright.“You get to that phase, and my friends told me about it,” Ciara explained. “When your kids start reaching a certain age, they don’t wanna hold your hand so much anymore. They’re like, ‘Mom, okay, give me 50 feet.’ So I think it (being a cool mom) depends on the child you have, but I do —I think I do alright. I think Mama’s tapped in, I think I’m tapped in with my kid community right now. I wanna make sure I’m on top of my stuff because I don’t want to get left behind. ”","Ciara, the wife of russell wilson, is known for sporting bold fashion.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, york university.

But this week, she announced a major transition: the newsletter, which began a year ago, is now officially hosted on Substack.In her announcement, the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse star expressed excitement for what’s ahead. “Surprise!

By sharing reflections on love, creativity, and womanhood, she’s connecting with fans on her own terms, a refreshing rarity in celebrity culture.As Josh Allen gears up for the Buffalo Bills’ Week 8 matchup, Steinfeld’s creative energy continues to flourish off the field.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale ai shut down an entire team of contractors in its dallas office this week.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie scott, the ex-wife of amazon co-founder jeff bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2 consoles has been delayed to 2026. In a recent statement, the game developer has confirmed that the Elden Ring edition explicitly designed for the Japanese gaming company’s latest console will not launch this year. The game was initially planned for release in 2025. Given that only a few months remain in the year, the delay was largely anticipated. Elden Ring has been shown playable on the Switch 2 at previous events, such as Gamescom, but has drawn criticism for its inconsistent frame rates. The extra time granted by the delay is expected to allow the development team to address performance issues.In a post shared on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), Elden Ring maker FromSoftware wrote:The Nintendo Switch 2 is designed to support ports of games that the original Switch could not run. It launched with games like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077, which performed smoothly and provided an early indication of the Switch 2's capabilities.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities.

""prompt injection,""

What cybersecurity experts said about new ChatGPT Atlas browser



“There will always be some residual risks around prompt injections because that’s just the nature of systems that interpret natural language and execute actions. In the security world, it’s a bit of a cat-and-mouse game, so we can expect to see other vulnerabilities emerge.”

“The main risk is that it collapses the boundary between the data and the instructions: it could turn an AI agent in a browser from a helpful tool to a potential attack vector against the user. So it can go and extract all of your emails and steal your personal data from work, or it can log into your Facebook account and steal your messages, or extract all of your passwords, so you’ve given the agent unfiltered access to all of your accounts,”

What OpenAI said about ChatGPT Atlas browser’s security



“Our long-term goal is that you should be able to trust ChatGPT agent to use your browser, the same way you’d trust your most competent, trustworthy, and security-aware colleague or friend.

For this launch, we’ve performed extensive red-teaming, implemented novel model training techniques to reward the model for ignoring malicious instructions, implemented overlapping guardrails and safety measures, and added new systems to detect and block such attacks.

However, prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem, and our adversaries will spend significant time and resources to find ways to make ChatGPT agents fall for these attacks,”

“logged out mode”

“Watch Mode”

“browser memories”





Cybersecurity experts have warned that OpenAI 's new ChatGPT Atlas browser could be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers can use this security flaw to turn AI assistants against users, potentially enabling theft of sensitive data or unauthorised access to bank accounts, experts claimed. The primary concern isa type of attack in which malicious instructions are fed to an AI system to make it behave in unintended ways, such as revealing sensitive information or performing harmful actions. Experts also said that all current AI browsers pose these security risks. OpenAI launched Atlas this week as an AI browser designed to help users execute tasks across the internet and search for answers.In a statement to Fortune, George Chalhoub, assistant professor at UCL Interaction Centre said:AI browsers face a security risk because they may not correctly distinguish user-generated prompts from content on untrusted websites. This allows attackers to create webpages containing hidden instructions that can trick the browser into performing actions such as opening the user’s email and exporting data.Some attackers may hide these commands using techniques like white text on a white background or embedding code within the site, making them difficult for users to notice but readable by the AI browser.Chalhoub explained.In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Dane Stuckey, OpenAI’s Chief Information Security Officer, said that the company was “very thoughtfully researching and mitigating” the risks associated with prompt injections.Stuckey wrote.Stuckey said OpenAI had introduced multiple measures to reduce risks and safeguard users, including rapid-response systems to block attacks, ongoing investment in research and security, and features such asandto enhance user control and safety.The ChatGPT Atlas browser is designed to make web browsing more interactive and assistive. It lets users search for information, plan trips, and book services directly through ChatGPT. The browser includesto remember user preferences and an experimental “agent mode” that allows ChatGPT to browse and interact with websites on the user’s behalf.","Cybersecurity experts have warned that openai's new chatgpt atlas browser could be vulnerable to attacks.

Surgeons remove up to 100 magnets from teen's gut





On Sunday, when thieves climbed to a second-floor window of the Louvre, grabbed jewels of staggering worth and descended to their getaway scooters via a furniture elevator, many in France were stunned and furious. But the German company that made the elevator saw a once-in-a-lifetime marketing opportunity. Alexander Bocker, the chief executive of the German machinery company Bocker, and his wife, Julia Scharwatz, recognised their Agilo truck-lift instantly, he said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. A day after the heist, they rolled out a new advertising campaign on social media. ""When you're in a hurry, the Bocker Agilo carries your heavy treasures,"" the ad boasted under a photo of the lift parked outside the Louvre. Their speedy marketing campaign captured an internet frenzy about the heist, which took less than 10 minutes and left no injuries except French pride. The company bought the rights to the photo on Monday morning after a bit of brainstorming by Bocker, Scharwatz and their employees. ""We have even had feedback from abroad saying, 'Hey, you Germans do have a sense of humour after all,'"" Bocker said in the interview. Bocker said that they decided to make the ad only after it became clear that no one had been hurt, and they had not actively promoted the advertisement in France.A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand swallowed up to 100 high-power magnets he bought on the online shopping platform Temu, forcing surgeons to remove tissue from his intestines, doctors said on Friday. After suffering four days of abdominal pain, the unnamed teen was taken to a hospital. ""He disclosed ingesting approximately 80-100 5x2mm high-power (neodymium) magnets about a week prior,"" said a report by hospital doctors in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The magnets have been banned in New Zealand since Jan 2013. Doctors said the pressure of the magnets had caused necrosis - tissue death - in the boy's small bowel and caecum. Surgeons operated to remove the dead tissue and retrieve the magnets, and the child was back home after an eight-day spell in hospital.","A day after the louvre heist, the german company that made the elevator saw a once-in-a-lifetime marketing opportunity.

A tragic night and a painful awakening

The science behind sleep and screens

A mother’s call for digital boundaries





Turning personal tragedy into a nationwide warning, a Virginia mother is urging parents to rethink the role of smartphones in their children’s lives, especially at night. Summer Bushman, from Salem, Virginia, lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year after months of bullying, both in person and online. In an interview with CBS News, she revealed that Autumn often used her phone in bed at night, a habit she now believes played a devastating role in her death. “She was looking at her phone just before it happened,” Summer said. “I wish I had never let her keep it in her room.”Autumn was, by all accounts, a bright and joyful child, a fourth-grade cheerleader who filled her home with music and dance. “She turned my living room into a stage,” her mother recalled. But behind her bubbly exterior, Autumn was struggling with relentless teasing about her braces and appearance.Like many children today, she sought connection through her phone, the same device that became a portal for cyberbullying. Late-night messages and social media comments compounded the hurt. What once might have ended at the school gates now followed her home, glowing quietly from her pillow.Psychologists call this the “24-hour schoolyard”, the digital extension of peer pressure and cruelty that leaves children little space to recover.On March 21, Autumn took her own life in her bedroom. When her mother found her, the phone’s screen was still on. “She used to say she needed her alarm,” Summer said softly. “And every morning when I went to wake her, the alarm was ringing.”The tragedy reflects a troubling pattern seen across the world. In the United States alone, youth suicide rates have risen by over 50% in the past decade, with growing evidence linking social media use, especially at night, to depression and self-harm. A 2019 Lancet Psychiatry study found that adolescents spending more than three hours a day on social media were twice as likely to report mental health issues.Late-night phone use does more than expose children to online harm; it directly affects their mental and physical health. Screens emit blue light, which suppresses the hormone melatonin, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation, in turn, intensifies anxiety, impulsivity, and depression, all factors linked to suicide risk.A recent Virginia Tech study reinforced this connection. Researchers found that nearly 75% of adolescents who attempted suicide were using screens shortly before and that most incidents occurred after 8 p.m. “It’s pretty dangerous for bullied children to have their phones at night,” lead researcher Dr. Abhishek Reddy noted. “During the day, they have access to support, counsellors, teachers, parents. At night, that access disappears. ”For Summer, her daughter’s loss has become a mission. She now advocates for parents to remove phones from bedrooms, restrict nighttime use, and encourage healthier sleep routines. “If I could go back, I’d take that phone away,” she said. “She deserved to live a long, happy life. Now, I’ll never see her go to prom, get married, or chase her dreams.”Her message echoes growing calls among educators and child psychologists to delay smartphone access for young children altogether. Some schools in the US and Europe are now implementing “phone-free hours” or collecting devices during class to curb dependency.","Summer bushman lost her 10-year-old daughter autumn to suicide earlier this year.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

Internet reacts to the bold move



Turning humour into brand strength





Turning crisis into opportunity was never this epic. When a Böcker Agilo forklift, built by the German company Böcker Maschinenwerke GmbH, was used in a daring daylight robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, the manufacturer decided not to hide from the spotlight. Instead, it embraced the unexpected publicity with humour. The company shared a photo of the same forklift used by the thieves and turned it into a cheeky advertisement with the caption, “When things need to be done quickly.” The move quickly caught global attention and went viral online.The forklift, designed to lift goods, was reportedly used by robbers to access the Louvre’s upper floors and steal several pieces of priceless jewellery in a heist that lasted just a few minutes. Rather than treating the association as negative publicity, Böcker’s management team saw a creative opportunity.Alexander Böcker, the company’s managing director, and his wife decided to use the image from the heist in an online post highlighting the forklift’s efficiency and power. The caption humorously pointed out the lift’s speed, capacity (up to 400 kilograms), and quiet motor — the very qualities that made it a perfect, if unintended, tool for the robbers.Amid the growing online buzz, Böcker clarified that the Agilo lift is meant solely for transporting materials, not humans. The company said the ad was intended as a lighthearted response, not an endorsement of criminal behaviour. “It was a humorous way to acknowledge the situation,” a company statement read.Despite the controversy, the post struck a chord with many people who appreciated the company’s ability to laugh at an absurd situation while keeping its brand voice intact.The campaign sparked mixed reactions on social media. Some users praised Böcker’s sense of humour and marketing creativity, calling it “a masterclass in PR under pressure.” Others found it inappropriate, arguing that making light of a museum theft involving cultural artefacts was in poor taste.Still, the post achieved what few marketing efforts can — it went viral worldwide, appearing on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and even being covered by international news outlets.The incident has now become a case study in how companies can turn unexpected moments into branding opportunities. By turning a potentially damaging situation into a playful, confident message, Böcker managed to boost its visibility across global markets.While the Louvre robbery investigation continues, one thing is clear: the forklift that once helped thieves make a quick getaway has now lifted Böcker’s marketing game to new heights.“When they said lift your brand, Böcker took it literally.”",A böcker agilo forklift was used in a daring daylight robbery at the louvre museum in paris.

A video has emerged showing two thieves calmly escaping the Louvre Museum in Paris with an estimated €88 million (£76 million) worth of France’s crown jewels — in what is being described as one of the country’s most spectacular heists in decades.The 36-second clip, verified by Le Parisien, shows two men dressed in black — one wearing a yellow hi-vis vest, the other a motorcycle helmet — descending on a furniture lift from the museum’s Apollo Gallery, where the jewels were displayed.The video, apparently filmed from a nearby window, captures them leaving the scene on scooters parked along the Quai François Mitterrand, where a stolen truck with a 30-metre extendable ladder and basket lift had been stationed earlier.“They are going to leave,” a voice, thought to be that of a security guard, is heard saying on a walkie-talkie. Moments later, another voice adds: “Damn, there we go — the police.”Two members of a four-man gang broke into the gallery at 9.30 am on Sunday, shortly after the museum opened. They smashed an unsecured window and used disc cutters to open two display cases, seizing eight historic pieces, including an emerald and diamond necklace gifted by Napoleon I to Empress Marie Louise, and a diadem that once belonged to Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.The heist, executed in under seven minutes, saw the men inside the gallery for just under four minutes.France’s Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said more than 100 investigators have been assigned to the case. Speaking before French senators, Louvre director Laurence des Cars called the theft a “terrible failure,” admitting that security camera coverage of the museum’s exterior walls was ‘highly insufficient’.",Louvre museum thieves caught on camera escaping with the jewels.

The RTA has allocated 40 retail outlets spanning 15,860 square feet and five sales kiosks for commercial use across these stations. The 15-kilometre Route 2020 corridor was designed to serve over 270,000 residents, with capacity for 46,000 riders per hour in both directions.According to RTA projections, daily ridership is expected to reach 125,000 passengers initially and 275,000 passengers per day by 2030. The Expo Station alone is forecast to handle around 35,000 weekday visitors and 47,000 visitors on weekends, accounting for nearly 30% of Expo’s total daily attendance.The Jumeirah Golf Estates Station, at 27,000 square metres, is the largest station on the network and can accommodate up to 250,000 riders per day.
