NEW DELHI: The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), which provides healthcare services to lakhs of government employees, pensioners and their families, is operating with a significant shortage of staff across its allopathic and AYUSH dispensaries, the Union Health Ministry informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.In a written reply, the government revealed that more than 2,000 posts in allopathic dispensaries and over 100 posts in AYUSH units remain vacant, raising concerns over service delivery in one of the country’s largest healthcare networks.According to the ministry, CGHS allopathic dispensaries have a sanctioned strength of 6,630 posts, but only 4,590 are currently filled, leaving 2,040 posts vacant. The situation is similar in AYUSH facilities, where 107 of the 425 sanctioned posts remain unfilled. The data shows gaps across all levels of staffing.In the crucial Group A category, which includes doctors, 402 allopathy posts and 33 AYUSH posts are lying vacant. Group B non-gazetted positions also show shortages, with 276 allopathic posts vacant. The most acute gaps are in Group C—the largest workforce segment comprising paramedical and support staff—where 1,362 allopathic posts and 74 AYUSH posts are unfilled.The government said that recruitment of doctors is carried out through the Union Public Service Commission’s Combined Medical Services Examination based on vacancies reported by CGHS. Recruitment for Group B and Group C positions is handled by the Staff Selection Commission. However, the reply did not indicate the timeframe within which the pending vacancies would be filled or whether special measures are being planned to speed up hiring.The disclosure comes at a time when CGHS dispensaries in major cities frequently struggle with long queues, limited manpower and rising patient load. The persistent vacancies, especially in frontline and paramedical roles, are expected to intensify pressure on the system unless addressed promptly. For thousands of beneficiaries dependent on CGHS for essential outpatient care and medicines, staffing shortages continue to translate into longer waits and uneven access to services.","The central government health scheme (cghs) is operating with a significant shortage of staff.

In the predatory world of American artificial intelligence, where top engineers command salaries in the millions and signing bonuses rival small fortunes, Apple Inc has taken a big bite out of Microsoft and Google The iPhone giant on Monday announced the hiring of Amar Subramanya, a Bengaluru-educated Google veteran who briefly led AI efforts at Microsoft, as its new vice president of artificial intelligence, in an effort to catch up with rivals who have sped ahead. Subramanya steps into a role vacated by the retiring John Giannandrea, inheriting oversight of Apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and AI safety teams amid a high-stakes push to salvage its lagging AI ambitions.Subramanya's whirlwind journey—from Alphabet's Mountain View labs, where he helmed engineering for the Gemini AI assistant, to Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for a five-month co-piloting stint as corporate vice president of AI, and now to sickly Siri at Apple's Cupertino campus—epitomizes the escalating talent war gripping Silicon Valley and beyond.With Microsoft poaching over 20 researchers from Google's DeepMind unit earlier this year, including Subramanya in July, and now Apple counter-recruiting from its rivals, the US AI ecosystem has become a revolving door of elite minds, many of them immigrants like Subramanya.The migration isn't just about prestige; it's a battle for the intellectual capital needed to build the next generation of intelligent machines, as companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic lure defectors with million dollar windfalls, even as MAGA myopics mope about “slave labor” and “code coolies” from India and wallow in toxic gibes on X.At 46, Subramanya arrives with impeccable credentials tailored to Apple's pain points. After earning a BE in electrical, electronics, and communications engineering from Bangalore University in 2001, he completed his PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle in 2009 with a dissertation on semi-supervised learning and graphical models, innovative techniques for training AI systems with limited labeled data — now a boon for privacy-obsessed Apple, which shuns vast user-data troves in favor of synthetic and licensed datasets.Subramanya's graduate work also extended to practical applications in speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and human activity analysis. As a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research, he tackled multi-sensory fusion for robust speech systems and speaker verification, earning a prestigious Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship in 2007. This early exposure to Big Tech's labs foreshadowed his career, blending theory with deployment. His scholarly output includes the influential book Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning (co-authored with Partha Pratim Talukdar), a staple in machine learning curricula. His academic papers span entity resolution, multilingual Natural Language Processing, cross-document coreference, and audio-visual speech enhancement, underscoring his focus on scalable, multimodal systems.These foundations propelled Subramanya's 16-year Google tenure, starting around 2009 in research roles that evolved into engineering leadership. By 2023, he was head of engineering for Gemini, Google's multimodal powerhouse boasting up to 1.2 trillion parameters. Under his watch, teams of over 100 bridged experimental prototypes to production, integrating text, image, and video processing into Search, YouTube, and Android.Subramanya's pivot to Microsoft in July 2025 – along with a score of gearheads including engineering lead Sonal Gupta – was a cultural reset. In a LinkedIn post that raised plenty of eyebrows, he praised the software giant's ""refreshingly low-ego yet bursting with ambition"" ethos, throwing shade at Google's high-pressure environment. As corporate VP of AI, he contributed to foundation models powering Copilot, the enterprise chatbot embedded in Office and Azure.Both Microsoft and Google are led by Indian-Americans – Satya Nadella and Sundar Picha- – but Subramanya’s stint outside Seattle lasted less than six months before Tim Cook lured him back to Silicon Valley.For Apple, reeling from AI stumbles, Subramanya is a strategic antidote. The company's Apple Intelligence suite, unveiled in October 2024, has faltered: notification summaries spawned fabricated headlines, from false reports of a suspect's suicide to premature sports victories to Netanyahu’s arrest, drawing ire and lawsuits. Siri's promised overhaul—touted for contextual awareness and app control—languished after internal tests flopped, delaying rollout to spring 2026.Giannandrea, like Subramanya a Google import who once led Machine Intelligence, is said to have fostered research but struggled with product delivery. His 2024 paper on ""large-reasoning models"" critiqued AI's simulated cognition, yet Apple's outputs lagged. Now, with Giannandrea advising until spring, Subramanya will report to software SVP Craig Federighi, tasked with accelerating a 1-trillion-parameter in-house model while leaning on Apple’s upcoming $1 billion licensing deal with Gemini to revive Siri – delicious irony in the Apple-Google feud spanning maps to mobile.","Amar subramanya is a bengaluru-educated google veteran who briefly led ai efforts at microsoft. He steps into a role vacated by the retiring john giannandrea, inheriting oversight of apple's foundation models, machine learning research, and ai safety teams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125709180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-934153,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday hit back at the Congress after the opposition accused the government of infringing on citizens’ privacy by directing smartphone makers to preload the Sanchar Saathi app on new devices.Taking a jibe at the Congress, BJP MP and national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, “I know who will delete it… 'Chor ki daadhi mein tinka' (a guilty conscience needs no accuser)""He also made a veiled reference to the National Herald case, in which Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are accused. “You know very well who they are. An FIR has also been filed against them. They have swindled Rs 5,000 crore. At present, they are out on bail,” he told reporters at the BJP headquarters, as reported by PTI.Defending the app, Patra said it is designed to protect users from fraud and crime, not to monitor them, and emphasised that people are free to remove it from their phones if they do not wish to use it.“The app cannot read your messages. It cannot listen to your calls, incoming or outgoing. Sanchar Saathi cannot reach or breach your personal data.” He added that the app helps provide security, check fraud, track stolen mobile phones, and return them to their owners.Minister of communications Jyotiraditya Scindia also,clarified that the app will remain dormant unless users register on it, and can be deleted at any time.Congress has alleged that the directive reflects a “dictatorial” approach, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app” and demanding that the move be withdrawn. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of trying to “strangulate the voice of the people”.Responding sharply, Patra said, ""Mr Kharge, it is not meant to strangulate people's voice but to secure their voice, and their mobile phones, without which life is difficult today. We need to secure the device. That is why the government has brought this app.”“You keep on spreading misinformation. But people know how to move on,” he added, as quoted by PTI.","Bjp mp and national spokesperson sambit patra said, “i know who will delete it… 'chor ki daadhi mein tinka' (a guilty conscience needs no accuser)"" he also made a veiled reference to the national herald case, in which congress leaders sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi are accused.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125720106,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-887148,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

As India plans a long-term presence in low-Earth orbit, what design or mission principles from the ISS would you keep, revise, or discard?

Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) 20-day mission to the International Space Station earlier this year gave India a rare, first-hand view into how the world’s most complex engineering project functions on an ordinary day—and how it copes when things are not ordinary at all. As India prepares for a sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit through the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, Shukla’s reflections offer a grounded account of what the ISS achieved, where it stumbled, and how India should shape its own long-term strategy.In this exclusive interview to TOI, Shux speaks about the moments that defined his time on the station, the value of international collaboration, and the design philosophy that India could adopt for missions in the coming decades.The International Space Station remains one of humanity’s most dazzling examples of what happens when engineering ambition meets international cooperation, and miraculously, everyone agrees on the same orbit. Conceived in an era when floppy disks were still in fashion and the internet sounded like a dial-up flute, the ISS was built to push the boundaries of science in microgravity, test systems essential for future deep-space missions, and serve as a beacon of peaceful collaboration between nations that otherwise rarely agree on anything terrestrial.Construction of this orbital leviathan began in 1998 and reached completion in 2011. To assemble it, humanity performed a kind of celestial Lego project that required more than 1,000 hours of spacewalks and more than 40 Space Shuttle flights. The result? The largest continuously inhabited laboratory off the planet, a structure the size of a football field hurtling around Earth at 28,000 km/h, completing a lap every 90 minutes.During my own mission aboard the ISS, the station felt exactly like the global village it was designed to be. We had 11 crew members representing six nationalities, a small floating model of the United Nations , minus the speeches and with better views. Over the course of our 20-day stay, we conducted more than 60 scientific experiments spanning biology, materials science, human physiology, and space technology. We also carried out STEM demonstrations that connected us with students across the world, sparking curiosity, answering wide-eyed questions, and hopefully inspiring the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers.Looking back, those 20 days perfectly captured the essence of what the ISS set out to achieve. For a machine conceived with 1990s technology, when the most futuristic thing on Earth was a Nokia phone, to not only remain relevant but to continue fulfilling and expanding its mission objectives is extraordinary. The station does not just orbit Earth; it orbits the idea that cooperation, curiosity, and courage can build something remarkable, even 400 kilometres above our heads.Working with crew members from different nationalities reaffirmed something fundamental about space exploration: at its core, it is a profoundly collaborative human endeavour. Space does not care about passports, accents, or geopolitical boundaries. Up there, the only border you notice is the thin blue line of Earth’s atmosphere.During my training for this mission, I found myself hopping across continents more frequently than airline safety videos. From the meticulous engineers in Japan, to the precision-driven teams in Europe, to the seasoned experts in the United States, and the ever-innovative minds in India, each group brought its own culture, expertise, and philosophy to the table. It was like assembling a global orchestra where every instrument mattered, and the symphony was a successful human spaceflight.Before this mission, I knew conceptually that space operations required international coordination. But seeing it firsthand—the late-night calls across time zones, the joint simulations, the integrated training programmes, and the sheer number of people quietly working behind the scenes—made me appreciate the astonishing complexity of sending even one human to space. A single crewed mission represents thousands of hours of planning, countless technical discussions, and the collective will of teams who might never meet but still trust one another implicitly.Beyond accomplishing scientific and operational goals, this collaboration builds something equally important: relationships and trust among people from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. In space, camaraderie is not optional; it is oxygen for the mission. You quickly learn that no matter where someone comes from, if they work in human spaceflight, they speak a common language: space.As we continue advancing on our journey in human space exploration, it is vital that we hold on to this foundational principle. The power of collaboration is not just a sentiment; it is the engine that drives progress. Space has always transcended boundaries, and the work we do should honour that spirit. The only way humanity will reach farther into the cosmos is by going there together.The first module of the International Space Station, the Russian-built Zarya, appropriately named “Dawn”, launched in 1998, marking the beginning of humanity’s most ambitious construction project not on Earth. Over the next 13 years, we assembled this orbital behemoth piece by piece, like a cosmic IKEA kit, except the manual was 10,000 pages long and required spacewalks instead of Allen keys.One of the ISS’s greatest design triumphs was its modular architecture. This was not just clever; it was visionary. The modular approach meant components, scientific racks, power systems, and entire habitable modules could be added, upgraded, or even replaced long after launch. Several of the station’s capabilities today, from advanced biology labs to new solar arrays, were not on the drawing board in the 1990s. Yet the structure welcomed them gracefully, proving its resilience.Another stroke of genius was the strict standardisation of interfaces and protocols. Despite contributions from different space agencies—Nasa, Roscosmos, ESA, JAXA, and CSA—each with its own engineering philosophy, the requirement was simple: any module joining the ISS had to integrate seamlessly with the command-and-control backbone. This ensured that a Japanese experiment rack, a European robotic arm, and an American airlock could all operate in harmony.Equally important was the flexibility for on-orbit maintenance and upgrades. Astronauts often replaced hardware, rerouted cables, installed new instruments, and even deployed new solar arrays. When you build for decades of use, you cannot predict every challenge, so the ISS needed enough adaptability to absorb surprises.That said, the ISS was not designed to be fully future-proof. Technology has moved fast in the last two decades, and modern ISS interiors sometimes look like an enthusiastic octopus let loose with a box of cables. It is high-functioning chaos.As we look ahead, this is the lesson we must carry forward: whatever we design today must be able to absorb the technology of tomorrow.As the ISS approaches its well-earned retirement after more than two decades in orbit, it leaves behind a legacy and a treasure trove of lessons. My time aboard crystallised one truth: before building a space station, you must begin with a sharply defined question—what is it for?Is it a research laboratory? A technology testbed? A stepping stone to the Moon? A commercial outpost? A training ground? The purpose shapes everything that follows.The ISS has also shown the power of collaboration. At a time when nations often disagree on Earth, the station has remained a counterexample, an engineering handshake orbiting above geopolitics. It is still the only structure where multiple countries can send astronauts, run experiments, and access an environment otherwise out of reach. India has been a proud beneficiary of this openness.But the ISS also teaches caution: mismatched priorities, slow adaptation to emerging technologies, and design decisions frozen in the 1990s reveal pitfalls to avoid.Going forward, the challenge is to distil the ISS story into a blueprint for the next chapter of human presence in space. Embedded in its cables and maintenance logs are lessons on what must be done, what must never be done again, and what must be done better. The ISS is not merely retiring; it is passing the torch.The philosophy of modularity has been one of the ISS’s greatest gifts to space engineering. In microgravity, “weight” loses its meaning, and you can launch components separately, even years apart, and assemble them like an orbital jigsaw. But modularity works only if you treat construction as a long-term strategy, a roadmap spanning decades.Flexibility is the other key lesson. Space teaches you quickly that no plan survives first contact with reality. The ISS construction phase was a masterclass in adapting to hardware mismatches, alignment quirks, and surprises delivered by orbital mechanics. The design must have elasticity to absorb new insights and evolving technologies.A station is not just modules; it is an ecosystem. The Earth-based infrastructure—mission control, simulators, life-support testbeds, logistics chains—matters as much as the hardware in orbit. Astronauts need operational flexibility too. They become builders, plumbers, electricians, scientists, and troubleshooters.Design follows objectives. Before drawing the first bolt pattern or finalising an airlock diameter, the mission’s purpose must be clear.As India prepares for the Bharatiya Antariksh Station, we are at a pivotal moment. The insights from decades of ISS operations—its triumphs, surprises, and even its cluttered cable aesthetics—are guiding our approach. We now have the opportunity to design a next-generation station informed by a quarter-century of real orbital experience.","Group captain shubhanshu shukla’s 20-day mission to the international space station earlier this year gave india a rare, first-hand view into how the station functions.

DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has grounded an Air India aircraft and launched a detailed investigation after the airline reported that the aircraft had operated eight revenue sectors on an expired Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC).According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted in the press note shared by ANI, ""Air India informed the regulator on 26 November 2025 that one of its aircraft had been inadvertently deployed for commercial flights despite the ARC having lapsed. The ARC is a mandatory annual certification that validates an aircraft’s continued compliance with airworthiness standards and its main Certificate of Airworthiness. ""In the press note, the ministry explained that the lapse occurred in the context of the ongoing merger of Vistara into Air India. As part of the transition, all 70 Vistara aircraft required renewed ARCs in 2024, with the DGCA assuming responsibility for issuing the certificates post-merger. While 69 aircraft received renewed ARCs after satisfactory checks, the 70th aircraft was grounded for an engine change after the operator filed its renewal application.During this period, its ARC expired, but the aircraft was subsequently released for service.Once the lapse was detected, the DGCA instructed Air India to immediately ground the aircraft and began an inquiry into how it was allowed to operate without a valid ARC. The certification process for the aircraft is now under way.The ministry said the personnel involved have been de-rostered with immediate effect pending the outcome of the probe. Air India, acting on DGCA’s directions, has initiated an internal investigation to identify system gaps, accountability failures, and corrective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.",The directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has grounded an air india aircraft.

Sanchar Saathi App Optional Says Centre Amid Fierce Pegasus-Like Snooping Charges and Privacy Debate

Attempt to snoop on citizens, says Cong

Global mobile giants concerned over move

NEW DELHI: A day after a furore erupted over its decision to mandate pre-loading of state-run Sanchar Saathi app on all new smartphones, govt Tuesday said users are free to delete the application if they do not want to have it on their devices.Amidst concerns over violation of user privacy, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia emphasised that the fears were unfounded and added that the app was to protect the users from cyber frauds.Scindia asserted that there is no chance of snooping or call monitoring through the app. “It is our responsibility to make this app reach everyone. If you want to delete it, delete it. If you don't want to use it, don't register it. If you register it, it will remain active. If you don't register it, it will be inactive,” he told reporters outside Parliament.Communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia Tuesday said mobile users were free to delete Sanchar Saathi app if they wished. However, the department of telecom’s Nov 21 order mandates the pre-installation of the app on phones under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments.Not doing this will lead to action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended).Also, the govt order had instructed manufacturers to “ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi application is readily visible and accessible … and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.However, govt sources said the phrase is a direction to manufacturers, not a restriction on users.“It simply means manufacturers must not hide, cripple or pre-install a non-functional version of the app and later claim compliance. Nowhere it has been mentioned in the above clause that the Sanchar Saathi app cannot be uninstalled by the end user. It is up to the citizen if he wants to enable and register Sanchar Saathi or wants to uninstall it. Users remain free to uninstall or delete Sanchar Saathi if they do not wish to use it, as clearly clarified by the govt,” the govt sources said.The move has already seen critics find a parallel to a similar mandate issued by the Russian govt in Aug, requiring pre-installation of state-backed messaging app, MAX.The Union communications minister said there have been more than 1.5 crore downloads of the Sanchar Saathi app, over 2.7 crore fraudulent mobile connections have been disconnected, and around 20 lakh stolen phones have been traced.Congress called the directive on installation of Sanchar Saathi app in phones as another attempt by BJP to snoop on citizens, with party president Mallikarjun Kharge citing Modi govt’s “record” of “Pegasus snooping” when it “hacked” the telephones of opposition leaders, judges, journalists and even Union ministers. Kharge said, “Why does the Govt want to know what citizens talk about with their family and friends?” Demanding a rollback , AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, “Big Brother cannot watch us. This DoT directive is beyond unconstitutional.”The govt’s diktat to mobile phone makers to mandatorily pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app has raised alarm bells among top global players such as Apple, Samsung and Google. While not officially commenting on the matter, the companies are looking to take up the matter with govt representatives directly, while also raising it through industry body ICEA.“This is a violation of user privacy and also makes the devices susceptible on the cyber security front. We are concerned about this, and will take it up,” said an executive at one of the companies","Communications minister jyotiraditya scindia said mobile users were free to delete sanchar saathi app if they wished. However, the department of telecom’s nov 21 order mandates the pre-installation of the app on phones under the telecommunications (telecom cyber security) rules, 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125728305,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-124512,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

India’s new cooperative app-based taxi platform — billed as the world’s first national mobility service fully owned by drivers — has become the largest driver-run mobility collective anywhere, even before its full rollout.Sahakar Taxi Cooperative Limited, which promotes the Bharat Taxi brand, enrolled more than 51,000 drivers across New Delhi and Gujarat’s Saurashtra region in just 10 days, surpassing New York’s The Driver’s Cooperative, launched in 2020 with roughly 4,000 members.Tuesday marked a milestone as beta consumer trials began in Delhi, allowing everyday users to test the Bharat Taxi app — now live on Google Play — while drivers activate real-time services. In plain terms: beta trials let riders and drivers use the platform under close monitoring, enabling developers to fix glitches and improve features before a full-scale release. An iOS version is expected soon.“The response is overwhelming,” said Jayen Mehta, chairman of Sahakar Taxi Cooperative Ltd. At the heart of the model is a zero-commission structure. The unique aspect of this model is that 100% of the fare paid by customers goes to the drivers.","Bharat taxi is billed as the world’s first national mobility service fully owned by drivers.

Asmongold reacts to Twitch ad issues after viewer reports and dashboard check



Also read:





A new controversy has erupted between creators and Twitch and it's spreading across social media after streamer Zack “Asmongold” reacted in disbelief to what he says the platform is paying him for ads on his alternate channel. A short clip from his broadcast has gone viral online, showing him going through his earnings dashboard live and questioning how ads could be running on his stream while he earns almost nothing from them. The moment struck a chord with viewers who say they have seen more ad interruptions lately without any clear explanation.Fans shared the video widely because Asmongold has long been one of the loudest voices when it comes to calling out problems on streaming platforms. This time, the frustration came from his Zackrawrr channel, where he was reviewing recent data and trying to understand why viewers were reportedly seeing ad breaks that did not appear to match his own revenue numbers. The reaction quickly turned into a larger conversation about how Twitch handles ad distribution and payments.During his December 1, 2025, stream, Asmongold pulled up a post from his subreddit in which a viewer claimed that Twitch had paused his livestream for an ad that never appeared and then asked for money to continue watching without interruptions.The viewer wrote, ""Twitch stopping stream for an ad that doesn't exist, to then ask me for money to watch stream uninterrupted.""Surprised, Asmongold clicked into his dashboard to see what was going on. As he scrolled, he read the numbers aloud, saying, ""Ad time per hour - seven seconds! Oh, my god! So, they're cutting down? Now I don't get any fking money! So, they spam ads on my channel... they're running ads on my st, and I don't even get any money. Crazy. 'You don't get (Twitch) Turbo, too?' I don't get Turbo. I don't get anything.""He then checked the revenue breakdown and reacted even more strongly. He said, ""11 cents. What do you mean, 11 cents? Zero dollars. 10 cents. Two cents. I got two pennies! Ad time per hour - seven seconds!""This moment arrived just days after another headline involving the streamer. On November 28, 2025, Asmongold told viewers he would permanently ban anyone who gifted 1,000 Twitch subscriptions to his channel, a gesture that costs $4,990.",Asmongold calls out twitch over sudden stream interruptions.

Donna Kelce’s new acting journey in The Gift Exchange



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year, and now Donna Kelce is joining the fun with a holiday project of her own. The proud NFL mom revealed that she is starring in a new Christmas-themed collaboration with Google, and the announcement itself felt like something straight from a holiday film. On December 1, she posted a snowy and charming movie-style poster on Instagram, presenting herself in the heart of a festive town square while a couple exchanges gifts in front of her. Donna stood with a gentle smile, wearing a cozy sweater and clasping her hands in the warm glow of a classic seasonal moment.Her caption added a touch of anticipation. “#Google_Partner #sponsored Gather the family for a new holiday (and @google) classic. Trailer kicking off soon.” It was short, spirited and enough to send fans into a cheerful buzz. The poster design also played into that spirit. With rich red and green lettering, the film title The Gift Exchange, and the Google tie-in slogan “Searching for something unforgettable? Just ask Google. ” it delivered the full holiday sentiment many viewers adore.Donna takes on the role of Carole Hall in this project. She appears alongside WWE star Nikki Garcia as Holly Hall and Chicago Fire actor Taylor Kinney as Aiden Winter.In the poster, her character looks like the wise and kind observer, pleased to see a love story unfold before her. While Donna revealed no further specifics about the production, her post did suggest it might be a holiday short film or sponsored cinematic campaign. Either way, fans embraced it, calling for more Donna screen time.This moment marks more than entertainment. It reflects a personal chapter for Donna Kelce. Just recently, she shared on the Not Gonna Lie podcast that she once dreamed of aviation. “I did learn how to be a pilot before I had children,” said Donna on the Not Gonna Lie podcast. “So, I actually went up and flew a plane. I did [enjoy it], but you want to have children, and it was really expensive, so I had to stop.” She chose family life, earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, completed studies at Ohio University, then worked three decades in banking as the “major breadwinner in the family. ”Her appearance in The Gift Exchange is not her first on camera. She also showed up in Hallmark productions like Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story and Christmas on Call, and called her earlier acting experience “so awesome.” Donna is also preparing for the new season of The Traitors, which adds to her growing media presence. If Hallmark or Lifetime is looking for another warm-spirited lead, Donna Kelce may be ready for her next starring moment.Also Read: Stefon Diggs vs Cardi B net worth: Who’s richer between the Grammy-winning rapper or the Patriots’ star receiver",Kansas city chiefs tight end travis kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

"Thousands of Amazon employees send open letter to CEO Andy Jassy; say: We are the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thousands-of-amazon-employees-send-open-letter-to-ceo-andy-jassy-say-were-the-workers-who-develop-train-and-use-ai-so-we-have-/articleshow/125646835.cms,"Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development. They warn of significant damage to democracy, jobs, and the environment, arguing that Amazon is sacrificing climate goals and human workers for AI dominance. The employees demand ethical AI practices, including clean energy use and employee involvement in AI decisions.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","I've been ready to be han ways i should have been ready of being someone who i've been able of being seven ways i been ready for people to be someone who has been han ways of being ready to say i been han han ways people that i have been able to be i'm going to be ready to come and been ready than i should be passed of the person who was ready to have been someone who died of trying to be compared for ways of more than 1,000 amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to ceo andy jassy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125646835,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53200,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to the Trash folder and stay there for up to 30 days before automatically disappearing. However, they still count towards your total storage until the Trash is emptied manually. The same rule applies to the Spam folder as well. By opening each folder and choosing the option to permanently delete all items together, users can often free up a surprising amount of valuable storage space almost instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially if large files are attached.
