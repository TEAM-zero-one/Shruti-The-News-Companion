Journal of Research in Environmental and Earth Sciences

Red tape may be often associated with officialdom but for J&K’s paperless bureaucracy, green is the go-to colour this year-end as it has achieved the equivalent of “planting over 4.5 lakh trees or taking over 2,200 cars off the roads permanently”, according to a study.Released on Monday, the study by Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, secretary in J&K’s science and technology department, shows the govt’s move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.Digitisation has removed the need for over 20 million paper pages each year, saving thousands of trees and cutting pollution, says Choudhary’s study, published by. The research provides a first-of-its-kind, scientifically grounded environmental impact evaluation of digital public administration in a fragile Himalayan ecosystem.The govt formally shifted from physical movement of files to e-office in 2021. Choudhary calls it a turning point in the region’s administrative history. “The environmental impact was massive -- 10,294 tonnes of CO2 eliminated every year. The scale of what changed is hard to grasp until you see the numbers. Since 2021, this transition has avoided printing 405.7 million pages. Think about that. Hundreds of millions of paper sheets that never got manufactured, never got transported, never ended up in landfills.Tens of thousands of trees still standing,” Choudhary said.The science and technology secretary explained the changes further. “As of mid-2025, over 26,000 users in the civil secretariat and more than 31,000 at HoD levels actively use the e-Office platform, processing millions of files and receipts annually. The transition has replaced physical file transport and in-person correspondence with a digital ecosystem supported by secure networks, VPNs, and over 1.8 lakh official email addresses,” says the study.The research was based on data from 2018 to 2025, administrative records, transport logs and energy consumption patterns, all analysed using international methodologies. “Now, 114,826 officials process everything digitally. They’ve handled 3.75 million files and 34 million receipts without paper. It’s faster, more transparent, and dramatically better for the environment,” Choudhary said.According to the secretary, the changes mark a paradigm shift in “our thinking on climate action”. “We focus so much on big industrial changes. But govt operations themselves have a significant carbon footprint. When you digitise an entire administrative system, especially in ecologically sensitive mountain regions, the environmental gains are substantial and immediate.”Choudhary held up the efforts as a model for administrative systems across India, especially in hilly states. “The combination of difficult terrain, fragile ecosystems, and administrative needs makes digital governance not just efficient but environmentally essential,” he said.","J&k's move from paper files to digital systems has helped avoid more than 62,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

3. Ferrari 599 Fiorano GTO



4. Rolls-Royce Phantom



5. Mercedes-Maybach 57S



With a billion-dollar net worth, LeBron James’ garage has been a work-in-progress for over two decades, resulting in becoming one of the NBA’s most expensive and luxurious car collections. These monsters on wheels aren’t just a medium of transportation for James but a physical manifestation of his ""King James"" brand.LeBron’s car collection has evolved into a portfolio of rare engineering feats and custom-wrapped legends. From hybrid hypercars to bespoke Ferraris, here is a look at the five most expensive vehicles currently in his fleet.This is the undisputed crown jewel of LeBron’s garage. Spanning the gap between a track monster and a fuel-efficient hybrid, this limited-edition hypercar is one of only 918 ever produced. The car features a 4.6L V8 paired with two electric motors producing 887 hp. It is a hybrid, but it hits 60 mph in about 2.2 seconds.LeBron's version features the ""Weissach Package"" for weight reduction and a custom ""KING 918"" license plate. Originally launched for $845,000, the value has gone through the roof in 2025, with an auction value between $1.8 million - $2.3 million.Perhaps this is Lebron James’ most recognizable car due to the custom floral pattern wrapping to match the lining of Nike LeBron XI ""King’s Pride"" sneakers.Some of the key features of this car are: a 6.5L V12 engine delivering raw 700hp, a top speed of 217 mph, and a one-of-a-kind custom wrap designed by Lou La Vie and Rich B. Caliente. The base price for this car starts at $450,000, but due to its unique customization, it stands at $700,000.LeBron has a deep affinity for the Prancing Horse, and the 599 GTO is his rarest. Produced in only 599, this car is a road-legal version of the 599XX and is equipped with a powerful 6.0L V12 screaming with 661 hp. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 in under 3.3 seconds. Commanding both performance and exclusivity, this car remains a treasured item for any collector. Though released for only $450,000, the auction price for this car can go up to $2 million.Originally a 25th birthday gift from his then-teammate Shaquille O’Neal, this white Phantom is the epitome of the billionaire’s opulent lifestyle. From a hand-crafted leather interior, thick wool carpets, to a starlight headliner with fiber optic, this car is a symbol of timeless regality. Boasting a 6.75L V12 engine, this Phantom can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds. James has meticulously maintained and upgraded this over the years.This car is one of the two Maybachs that LeBron James owns. Bought in 2008 between $400,000-$417,000, this car is a nod to his early ""King of Ohio"" days. Featuring a personalized license plate that reads ""KNG OF OH,” it remains one of the most comfortable long-distance cruisers in James’ collection. Some of the key features of this car are: a twin-turbo V12 engine producing 604 hp that could go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds, and a cabin that rivals a private jet's first-class suite.LeBron’s car collection is a masterclass in diversification. He doesn't just buy the new releases, he selects vehicles that hold historical weight or personal significance. As his net worth continues to climb in late 2025, these vehicles have transitioned from mere toys to high-value assets that appreciate right alongside his legacy.Also read: Ranking LeBron James’ top 5 most expensive watches in 2025","Lebron james' car collection has evolved into a portfolio of rare engineering feats and custom-wrapped legends.

Brittany Mahomes actively supports these efforts, highlighting the foundation's growing influence beyond football. The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team..Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars..Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity..The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick mahomes' 15 and the mahomies foundation is making a significant community impact.

What the New York Mets Gain - and Risk

The New York Mets are adjusting quickly after moving on from a player who had been part of the franchise for nearly a decade. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the Mets are looking for a short-term outfield solution that keeps spending under control while maintaining roster stability.That search has led them to Max Kepler. The veteran outfielder is viewed as a practical replacement rather than a headline move. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets defensive reliability and left-handed power without limiting future flexibility.The New York Mets’ plans shifted after a rare one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo agreed to waive his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million run in New York.On the field, Nimmo remained productive in 2025. He played 143 games and finished with a .261 average, 23 home runs, and 82 RBIs.Still, the Mets chose to prioritize infield stability and payroll balance. Semien now fills second base, but the move left a clear opening in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was slowed by knee issues. His overall numbers dipped, but the Mets see value in his defense and underlying power metrics. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and remains well-suited for corner work.A short-term deal also fits the Mets’ longer view. Top prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Kepler would serve as a bridge rather than a blocker. The savings compared to Nimmo’s contract also leave room to pursue pitching upgrades.Max Kepler gives the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concern is durability and age. Kepler is entering his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field question long term, which leaves the Mets relying on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers predicted to chase $6.25 million Minnesota Twins star to address center field and bolster squad Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

Matt Hardy’s wrestling career and long-term earnings

Reby Sky’s media work, business ventures, and lifestyle

Matt Hardy continues to stand as one of professional wrestling’s most recognizable figures due to his career spanning over multiple eras and multiple promotions. Whether it was his rise as part of The Hardy Boyz or the re-inventions that kept him relevant long into his forties, Hardy has long known how to capitalize on his name. As of the year 2025, wrestling contracts, merchandise, licensing, and digital appearances remain the basis of the wealth he created.That foundation is complemented by the streams of income brought in by Reby Sky, legally Rebecca Hardy. With a modeling/television/online media career that came before and through wrestling (and continues to exist), she has become a brand unto herself outside the ring. Considering how standalone earnings will translate into 2025, most industry watchers put them in a single net worth window of $3 million to $6 million apiece, depending on how private assets and ongoing business income are counted.The key to Matt Hardy’s wealth is immortality. It's hard for many wrestlers to stay active and stay relevant as we see three decades pass, but Hardy has done just that. It led to big WWE contracts, lengthy stints in Impact Wrestling, and, eventually, every so often, a return to major promotions for consistent paydays at multiple points in his career.In addition to base salaries, Hardy experienced the upsides of merchandise royalties, pay-per-view bonuses, and foreign tours.Well into his later career, his ability to reinvent himself, often through character-driven storylines, maintained the demand for appearances and allowed him to remain a commercially viable brand long after many peers quietly exited the scene.Most of Reby Sky's contribution to the couple's net worth comes outside of the ring. From her modeling career, television exposure, and powerful presence on social media platforms, she brings in advertising and partnership revenue. Working with brands and on her own media projects has given her ongoing revenue. Overall, her net worth is expected to increase in the coming year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Hardy and Sky share a lifestyle somewhere in the ballpark upper end of upper-middle-class; no one is reading about them in that section of the N.Y. Times, but they are investing in property, content, and long-term brand value. Though numbers are not publicly disclosed, 2025 saw their fortunes aligned, reflecting decades of diversified revenue streams, pages from similar playbooks on how to monetize notoriety, and years of incremental shifts from full-time wrestling to extended entertainment and continuing digital business interests.Also Read: Who is Jodi Lynn Calaway?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021.

"Where do we get captains from? AI, IndiGo locked in dogfight for pilots amid FDTL fallout; joining bonus up to Rs 50 lakh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/where-do-we-get-captains-from-ai-indigo-locked-in-dogfight-for-pilots-amid-fdtl-fallout-joining-bonus-up-to-rs-50-lakh/articleshow/126241900.cms,"‘Worst Is Behind Us’: IndiGo CEO Says Airline Back on Track After Operational Crisis

NEW DELHI: Call it the IndiGo schedule collapse and its fallout. A clamour has broken out between the budget airline and the Air India group over the availability of adequate captains to avoid a repeat of what happened under the new safety-enhancing Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules.IndiGo has had to commit to the DGCA that it will hire more pilots—it plans to induct 100 in January alone—while Air India has already issued advertisements to bring more aviators on board. However, both airlines are also facing a significant number of captain resignations, with some moving between the two carriers and many leaving to join foreign airlines. As a result, much of the hiring is aimed at simply maintaining current numbers, making the scramble more intense than anything seen before in Indian skies.For once, balance-sheet-centric human resource departments are on the back foot and can no longer oppose strengthening ranks after the events earlier this month. A senior official of one of the two major Indian carriers said its captains are already receiving “calls offering joining bonuses of up to ₹50 lakh”.“Where do we get captains from? Under the new FDTL norms, the availability of experienced pilots will become acute.There will be a lot of poaching from each other,” said a senior airline official.A few years ago, a senior pilot recalled, IndiGo had offered joining bonuses to experienced aviators to cover bond payments, if any, required to be paid to the airline they were resigning from. “This ranged between ₹15 lakh and ₹25 lakh to take care of bonds, which at the time were between ₹5 lakh and ₹15 lakh,” the pilot said.“India will witness a scramble for captains between the Air India group and IndiGo. While Air India does not currently face a shortage for most of its fleet—except the Boeing 787 Dreamliner—it needs to hire for the future. IndiGo will have to improve pilot-management relations to retain and attract talent. Akasa does not need more pilots as it has a large surplus. Unless Air India and IndiGo offer better working conditions, they will not be able to stem the outflow to the Middle East and other markets such as Vietnam,” said Captain Shakti Lumba, former vice-president of Air India and IndiGo.IndiGo has marginally raised pilot pay from next month by enhancing some existing allowances and introducing new ones. Air India, meanwhile, is planning a major move expected in the first week of January, details of which remain a closely guarded secret within the airline.Pilots at both the Air India group and IndiGo have been unhappy primarily due to poor working conditions and pay structures that have not kept pace with inflation. While the FDTL aims to reduce fatigue, the ongoing tug of war means both airlines will have to become more humane employers to retain pilots.While IndiGo will see an increase in pilot requirements due to less strenuous working norms under the new rules, Air India is preparing for aircraft inductions expected from next year. At present, only pilots operating Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet fly more intensively, while those on the Boeing 777 and Airbus A320 fleets fly less. This is expected to change from next year, and Air India does not want to find itself in IndiGo’s position when that happens.","Indigo has had to commit to the dgca that it will hire more pilots.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.","Former rockstar developer mike york warns that further delays to grand theft auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's josh woodward has jolted openai, forcing a 'code red' with his gemini app's rapid success.
