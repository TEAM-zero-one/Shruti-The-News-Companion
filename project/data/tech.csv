Natalie Reynolds’ Emotional Meltdown Outside TikTok HQ

Why Was Natalie Reynolds Crying Outside TikTok Headquarters in Viral Video?

Why Caused the TikTok Ban?

The Lake Incident That Sparked Backlash

What’s Next for Natalie?





A video of content creator Natalie Reynolds breaking down outside the TikTok headquarters has gone viral, and the internet has a lot to say. But who exactly is Natalie Reynolds? Why was she crying? And what led up to this dramatic moment? Here’s everything you need to know about the 26-year-old streamer making headlines again.Natalie Reynolds is a 26-year-old social media influencer based in Los Angeles. She first gained traction on TikTok in 2022 with lip-sync and dance videos. Over time, her content evolved into prank skits, relationship-based comedy, and risqué banter with her boyfriend, Zack (real name: Zachary Huelsman). The duo’s playful videos made them regulars on the “For You” page.Beyond TikTok, Natalie has built a strong online presence. She has:On June 9, a video surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) showing Natalie outside TikTok's headquarters in tears. She was seen anxiously speaking on the phone, pleading to be let inside. The reason? Her TikTok account had been banned, and she was reportedly trying to get it reinstated. Her emotional breakdown struck a chord online, with users debating whether it was genuine distress or a publicity move.As of now, the exact reason behind Natalie’s TikTok ban remains unclear. Neither TikTok nor Natalie has officially commented on the matter.However, speculation online suggests the ban may be linked to a controversial prank that backfired in a big way.In May, Natalie faced intense criticism after a prank video showed her convincing a homeless woman to jump into Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas, for just $20. The woman allegedly didn’t know how to swim.Natalie reportedly reassured her it was part of a “scavenger hunt” and promised to jump in after her. But when the woman entered the water, Natalie backed out and walked away.The woman was heard shouting that she couldn’t swim, only float. A firetruck was later seen arriving at the scene, presumably to help. Natalie and her group had already left by then.Many viewers were outraged, calling for legal action. Despite the uproar, Natalie shrugged off the backlash and showed no sign of remorse in her follow-up content.Despite the TikTok ban and public backlash, Natalie continues to post content on her other platforms. She remains active on Kick, where she hosts livestreams and talks about her life. She’s also still posting on Instagram and YouTube.However, her recent controversies are raising questions about influencer accountability—and whether platforms should step in when lines are crossed.Natalie Reynolds went viral for all the wrong reasons this time. From prank-gone-wrong to a breakdown at TikTok HQ, her journey is a reminder of how fast things can turn on the internet. Whether she makes a comeback or fades into digital infamy, one thing’s certain: the internet is watching.","Natalie reynolds is a 26-year-old social media influencer based in los angeles.

The planned shooting of Finny Da Legend by Manny Wise | Youtuber Shot Dead

A Disturbing Trend?





In a shocking turn of events, YouTuber SinCity-MannyWise has found himself at the center of an alleged shooting incident in Las Vegas. The June 8, 2025, confrontation caught on livestream has rocked the internet, leaving many wondering who SinCity-MannyWise is, what led to this moment, and what comes next. So, here’s everything you need to know!SinCity-MannyWise, known for his bold, Vegas-centric content, has been a familiar name in certain corners of YouTube. Often streaming from the Strip, casinos, and high-energy local events, MannyWise built a brand around unfiltered, sometimes confrontational videos. Despite a relatively short time on the platform, MannyWise built a cult-like following by streaming confrontational content and calling out other streamers.On Sunday night, June 8, viewers tuned in to what they assumed would be another loud and unpredictable Vegas stream. Instead, the live broadcast reportedly ended in gunfire.According to viral clips now circulating online, a man resembling SinCity-MannyWise was seen arguing with another couple outside the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Moments later, the man allegedly pulled out a handgun and fired multiple shots at them.The victims are believed to be Finny Da Legend and his wife, Bubbly, both prominent figures in the local content scene. Witnesses and the now-deleted video allegedly show the woman screaming in shock before the stream abruptly cuts out.While exact motives are still unclear, the two YouTubers had reportedly been involved in an ongoing digital rivalry. Viewers say the tension had been simmering online for weeks, with verbal jabs, heated livestreams, and online callouts. But no one expected the feud to spill over into the streets of Las Vegas.The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has acknowledged the incident but hasn’t officially released names. However, social media and fan speculation point to Finny Da Legend and Bubbly as the victims, both reportedly confirmed dead after the attack.The clip that captured the encounter has since been deleted from YouTube, but it continues to circulate on other platforms like X (formerly Twitter). In the aftermath, SinCity-MannyWise’s channel was terminated for violating YouTube's community guidelines. Meanwhile, Finny Da Legend’s channel remains online, with the final listed stream titledThis isn't the first time violence has intersected with livestreaming culture. In recent months, several creators have faced robbery, threats, or worse during live content. But this incident, if confirmed as a double homicide, marks a disturbing escalation.As for SinCity-MannyWise, his digital presence has vanished, but his alleged actions may echo far beyond the internet, possibly into a courtroom. This is a developing story. Stay tuned for further updates as more facts come to light.","Youtuber sincity-mannywise is at the center of an alleged shooting incident in las vegas.

A few days ago, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were also spotted in Palm Beach, California as they walked hand in hand. While Taylor Swift looked excited and happy, her name is still attached to the infamous Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni’s high profile legal drama, even though she is not subpoenaed anymore. Neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce spoke about the legal drama publicly, it seems like the NFL star has been with the pop star through this.Recently, as per Us Weekly, a source has revealed that “[Swift’s] emotions were heightened when [Baldoni’s] lawsuit was filed, while a second source added, ""and [Kelce] was definitely her sounding board.”As per Us Weekly, the source has also added that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce prefer to live in Florida rather than New York City due to the privacy they get.The source said, “They are making fewer public appearances together because [their relationship] brings too much unwanted attention…but there isn’t trouble in paradise.”Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had chosen to completely stop making any joint appearances after the drama that unfolded in Super Bowl LIX.The billionaire pop star’s name was already attached to the Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni drama which made things just worse for her.But it seems like in the last few weeks, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have decided to make more public appearances together despite the ongoing Blake Lively drama.As for Taylor Swift’s situation with her former best friend, the It Ends With Us star, Blake Lively, the two have completely avoided each other in public.Taylor Swift and Blake Lively used to be frequently spotted together but it seems like their friendship came to a standstill ever since Justin Baldoni sued his It Ends With Us co-star and the lawsuit found the pop star’s name in it.However, Taylor Swift has completely avoided addressing this topic in public even when she was spotted at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards back in February.

Who is Aaron Rodgers' girlfriend? Inside the veteran quarterback’s low-key relationship with Brittani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-aaron-rodgers-girlfriend-inside-the-veteran-quarterbacks-low-key-relationship-with-brittani/articleshow/121269467.cms,"Aaron Rodgers goes public with Brittani and calls the relationship “serious” (Getty Images)

Aaron Rodgers goes public with Brittani and calls the relationship “serious”

Brittani prefers privacy and stays away from the spotlight





Aaron Rodgers is embracing a quieter, more grounded kind of love with someone who’s far from the celebrity spotlight. The NFL quarterback, known as much for his headline-making relationships as his record-breaking career, confirmed in December 2024 that he’s dating a woman named Brittani. Since then, he’s offered rare but telling glimpses into their evolving relationship—revealing it’s not only “serious,” but also different from his past romances in meaningful ways.Aaron Rodgers casually introduced Brittani to the public during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, where he mentioned her while talking about his Christmas shopping. ""There was one package left for my girlfriend Brittani that hadn’t showed up yet,” he shared. “I was waiting on this to show up, it showed up today.” That low-key reveal may have seemed small, but for Rodgers—who’s often tight-lipped about his love life—it was a notable moment.A few months later, during the same show in April 2025, he shared a more intimate update. “I'm in a different phase of my life. I'm 41 years old, I'm in a serious relationship. I have off-the-field stuff going on that requires my attention,"" Rodgers said, signaling a deeper shift in his personal priorities.Unlike many of Aaron Rodgers’ former partners—including actresses Shailene Woodley and Olivia Munn—Brittani is not a public figure. She doesn’t use social media, doesn’t follow NFL media coverage closely, and seems happy to remain out of the limelight. Rodgers even joked during the McAfee show that she probably isn’t watching, though he added she might be a fan of the host.Rodgers has been open in recent years about his mental health journey, crediting practices like plant medicine with helping him build deeper emotional connections. On the Aubrey Marcus Podcast, he explained how self-love changed his ability to love others: “It’s only in that unconditional self-love, that then I’m able to truly be able to unconditionally love others.”Previously engaged to Shailene Woodley and romantically linked to other high-profile women, Rodgers now appears to be seeking—and finding—something more grounded. As he put it himself, “It’s a good feeling boys. It is.”Also Read: Cam Newton rips Saints’ quarterback strategy, urges the team to chase Aaron Rodgers in bold Super Bowl push With Brittani, the football icon seems ready to build something far away from cameras, red carpets, and public scrutiny.","Aaron rodgers confirmed in december 2024 that he’s dating a woman named brittani.

Parminder Singh, a former Managing Director at Google (Google Display, APAC) and Twitter, shared a light-hearted yet insightful anecdote on X about a chance encounter with Sundar Pichai years before he rose to become Google’s CEO.Singh recalled attending a Google office party in Mountain View where he was introduced to “an unassuming person who led the Chrome project.” Mistaking the humility for lack of knowledge, Singh said he began offering advice on Chrome notebooks, assuming shared tech expertise.“He listened patiently to my modest suggestions, even asking follow-up questions,” Singh wrote. “It soon became clear that he knew far more than I did — he was simply being gracious.”A few years later, Singh was surprised to learn that the man he had casually advised was none other than Sundar Pichai, newly announced as Google’s CEO. “That’s the thing about good leaders — they are great listeners,” Singh added.Reflecting on the moment years later, Singh said he recently listened to Pichai's two-hour interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, joking, “Balance restored, I guess!”When a user asked what advice he had given, Singh said he couldn’t recall much but believed he suggested making Chrome notebooks “more fun/playful” for school children and improving language translation tools for native speakers.Clarifying some confusion caused by the post, Singh added humorously, “It was a Google ‘office’ party — Google party is not a new app (since someone asked!).”","Parminder singh, a former managing director at google (google display, apac) and twitter, shared a light-hearted yet insightful anecdote on x.

Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data. International governments are also experimenting—Tokyo's metropolitan government recently introduced four-day options to address population decline and improve work-life balance .""We must build a society where everyone can balance work and family life, and one step forward is the four-day workweek,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told Fortune.Research supports worker interest, with 77% of employees saying a four-day workweek would favorably impact their wellbeing, even if maintaining 40 total hours, according to Gallup polling.","Kevin o'leary: ""there's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic"" 30% of ceos now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to kpmg survey.

GTA 6: Key gameplay leaks



GTA 6: Upgraded map



GTA 6: More speculated features



While Rockstar Games maintains a tight lid on information surrounding the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, a new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online, offering more details about the game's gameplay mechanics, expansive map, and various content elements. The leaks suggest that GTA 6 will feature over 700 enterable stores, functional malls, and a revamped character-switching system. Rockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 will launch on May 26, 2026, for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though a PC release date remains unannounced.According to reports from various gaming news outlets and social media discussions, these recent leaks suggest several intriguing gameplay additions. Among them is the purported return of a 6-star wanted level, a fan-favourite feature from previous GTA instalments. The ""relationship bar,"" previously hinted at in leaked 2022 clips and said to function akin to the ""honour"" system in Red Dead Redemption 2, also reportedly still exists.New elements include weight mechanics and explorable underwater areas brimming with treasure and secrets. The leak also claims that the scene from Trailer 2 where Jason buys beer is actual gameplay, hinting at enhanced environmental interaction. The ""greet and antagonise"" system, seen in Red Dead Redemption 2, is also rumoured to be integrated.A significant detail suggests a revamped character wheel with three options: playing as Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, or a Dual protagonist control mode allowing simultaneous control of both characters for open-world robberies and specific missions.The leaks indicate that GTA 6’s map will not feature a Panhandle, contradicting previous speculation. However, the game will still include a vast open world, with Vice City at its core and additional locations inspired by Florida’s diverse landscapes.While a ""Disney World parody"" is reportedly not included, fans are dissecting every pixel of the existing trailers and unconfirmed data to piece together the full scope of Vice City and its surrounding areas, including Ambrosia and Port Gellhorn.Further alleged content details include the presence of male strippers, an assertion that the driving mechanics are the ""best it's ever been,"" and gore/dismemberment built upon Red Dead Redemption 2's system. However, some rumoured features from earlier leaks, such as fully nude sex scenes, listening to music outside of a car, prone movement, and dual-wielding weapons, are now claimed to have been cut. The story is reportedly structured into five chapters, similar to Red Dead Redemption 2.","A new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online.

As everyone’s geared up for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025, excitement is building among tech geeks, developers, and iPhone users. Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","Ios 26 is expected to bring a ui redesign inspired by visionos, the operating system behind apple's vision pro.

Los Angeles protests: Why are Waymo robotaxis being torched? At least five self-driving cars destroyed in riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-protests-why-are-waymo-robotaxis-being-torched-at-least-five-self-driving-cars-destroyed-in-riots/articleshow/121740221.cms,"(Photo: X)

Waymos caught in the chaos

Not just about immigration

Robotaxis: Vulnerable in unrest

Fire risks and health concerns





Several Waymo self-driving taxis were vandalised and set alight during tense protests in Los Angeles following a wave of immigration raids.While the demonstrations were not specifically aimed at Waymo, the Alphabet-owned robotaxis became targets amid growing anger towards law enforcement, surveillance, and perceived inequality driven by Big Tech.At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend. Thick plumes of smoke billowed over downtown LA after demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted anti-ICE slogans, and set the driverless cars on fire. Some protesters reportedly threw electric scooters into the burning shells, while others ripped off car doors or used skateboards and improvised flamethrowers to damage the vehicles.The scenes unfolded on Los Angeles Street between Arcadia and Alameda around 5 pm on Sunday. According to CNN and the Los Angeles Times, the vehicles were found lined up and were soon overwhelmed by a crowd angry over the Trump administration’s decision to send in the National Guard, a move California governor Gavin Newsom opposed.Waymo insists the protests were not directly related to its operations. However, critics argue that the robotaxis represent more than just technology.They say the cars, equipped with dozens of cameras, function as roving surveillance devices and may pose a threat to protester anonymity.“Safety is our highest priority,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement. “We removed vehicles from Downtown Los Angeles and will not be serving that specific area for the time being, out of an abundance of caution and with guidance from LAPD.”A spokesperson told USA Today that the company is still operational across most of Los Angeles but has paused services in certain areas where protests have intensified.Waymo’s driverless vehicles, unlike human-operated taxis, lack the ability to judge and flee dangerous situations. Their programmed behaviour makes them passive targets during public unrest. They do not attempt to evade crowds or protest zones. This vulnerability, combined with their high-tech appearance, has made them stand out.The company’s rapid expansion has also drawn criticism. In January, Waymo said it had completed 1.9 million miles in LA alone. While the cars are popular with many users, some residents feel they were never consulted about having driverless technology tested in their neighbourhoods.The destruction of electric vehicles raised significant safety issues. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the blazes, and the LAPD warned that burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, such as hydrogen fluoride, which pose risks to both emergency responders and bystanders.Electric vehicle fires are harder to extinguish. Unlike petrol-fuelled cars, EV batteries do not need oxygen to burn. Firefighters instead have to cool the battery using large volumes of water, often through special nozzles that spray directly beneath the vehicle.","At least five waymo vehicles, all jaguar i-pace electric suvs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend.

LONDON: Market regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media, UK officials said Friday.Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the action, which began on Monday, has resulted in three arrests in the UK and the authorisation of criminal proceedings against three individuals.The crackdown is being conducted jointly with regulators from Italy, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates.Some 50 ""warning letters"" have been issued, which will result in more than 650 requests to remove content from social media platforms and more than 50 websites ""operated by unauthorised finfluencers"", the FCA said.It has also sent seven ""cease and desist"" letters and invited four so-called finfluencers for interviews.So-called finfluencers, or financial influencers, use their social media audiences to promote investment products, share advice, or offer their opinions on investments.Many act legitimately, but some ""tout products or services illegally and without authorisation through online videos and posts, where they use the pretence of a lavish lifestyle, often falsely, to promote success"", according to the FCA.These products can be risky, such as cryptocurrencies.""Our message to finfluencers is loud and clear,"" said Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA.""They must act responsibly and only promote financial products where they are authorised to do so -- or face the consequences.""The announcement came as a group of British MPs said it had sent a letter to Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, asking for information on its approach to financial influencers.The letter from parliament's Treasury Committee follows evidence from FCA officials that Meta took up to six weeks to remove harmful content, longer than other platforms.""There was an isolated incident in late 2024 which resulted in a delay in actioning a small number of reports from the FCA,"" Meta said in a statement Friday.""This was rectified and all other relevant reports made by the FCA have been promptly processed.""",Market regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media.

After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech's pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a ""dud"" in a research note.More AI, but what about Siri? In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri - a goal that has yet to be realized.""This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,"" Craig Federighi, Apple's top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.""The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,"" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. ""No amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don't know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.""Is Apple, with its 'liquid glass,' still a trendsetter? The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called ""Liquid Glass"" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a ""Workout Buddy"" to help manage physical fitness.Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac ""Our product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.""This year's event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement -positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,"" Jeronimo said.Apple's next operating system will be iOS 26 Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 - as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.Playing catchup in AI Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, ""F1"" starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.Regulatory and trade challenges Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year - a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday - an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",Apple highlights plans for more ai tools designed to simplify people's lives.

Corporate Bonds: What's On Offer

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Bank fixed deposits lose sheen! Retail investors seeking enhanced returns from fixed-income portfolios are increasingly gravitating towards corporate bonds offering higher yields. This shift has intensified following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) reduction in repo rates by one percentage point since February, leading to decreased bank fixed deposit rates.These investors are focusing on state-guaranteed securities, NBFC bonds, and small finance and microfinance bonds, which provide superior returns compared to traditional bank deposits.State Bank of India's fixed deposits with 2-3 years tenure offer maximum returns of 6.7%, whilst state-guaranteed bonds from Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, with 2-4 years tenure, yield returns between 9-10%.Various retail websites offer these bonds with a minimum investment requirement of ₹10,000. These platforms, known as Online Bond Platform Providers (OBPP), are SEBI-registered entities facilitating electronic bond transactions, according to an ET report.Platforms such as Indiabonds, Bondbazaar, Grip Invest and Wint Wealth are experiencing increased trading activity. One platform reported doubled trading volumes in the current quarter compared to July-September 2024.Another platform witnessed a tenfold increase in new registrations compared to the previous year.Also Read | ITR Filing FY 2024-25: Have you got an Income Tax notice?

He notes that the risk-free curve has steepened at the short to medium end with maturity of 2-3 years, making this segment attractive for those looking for better risk-adjusted returns without committing to long tenures.Also Read | Big cheer!
