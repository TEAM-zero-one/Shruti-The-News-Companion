The New Rules of Study Abroad 2025 | Managing finances and mistakes

NEW DELHI: The Centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals: raise enrolment (GER), improve employment and apprenticeships, build international links, upgrade quality and strengthen digital systems. The plan relies on ""big-ticket"" projects, state-wise targets and performance-linked funding.The quality measures include clearer accreditation bands, so that students can compare programmes easily and programmes that remain weak face closure; a national apprenticeship and placement exchange that will be integrated with campuses; and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) targets being set for each state. Financing will separate capital spending (buildings, labs, servers) from operational spending (faculty, maintenance, software), with officials indicating a tilt towards results-based grants, wherein funds are released after verification of milestones.As per the internal report accessed by TOI, stronger institutions will support nearby campuses through mentor-mentee clusters, sharing teachers, labs and lesson plans to help lift outcomes quickly. Funding will be tied to performance on learning and placements and not just inputs such as infrastructure. ""Clear goals, clear owners, clear data - that's the approach,"" a senior official with education ministrysaid.To connect education with employment, the National Apprenticeship and Placement Exchange will be integrated with campus ERPs, so employers can post openings and students can apply, track interviews and receive offers on one platform. ""Degrees must connect to jobs. A single exchange stitched into campus ERPs will cut friction for students and recruiters,"" the official added. For international students, a single window will handle visa, FRRO registration and housing to reduce paperwork and make Indian campuses easier to join.","The centre is preparing a five-year plan for higher education with five main goals.

Puka Nacua vs Arch Manning: Recent updates and future outlook

“best bargain in the NFL,”

Two young football stars are drawing big attention in 2025 for their earnings and potential. Puka Nacua is making his mark in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams. Meanwhile, Arch Manning is leading the charge in college football at the Texas Longhorns. Their money stories could not be more different. Here’s a clear, simple look at what each is earning and how their careers are unfolding.Puka Nacua’s base salary in 2025 is $1,030,000. He signed a four-year deal in 2023 worth about $4,084,980. That contract came with a signing bonus of around $244,980, and guaranteed money of the same amount.Analysts say that while his salary is modest now, his performance so far could trigger a much larger extension soon.Arch Manning, playing college football at Texas, has not signed an NFL contract yet. Instead, his earnings come from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. His NIL valuation in 2025 is estimated at $6.8 million, making him the highest-valued college athlete in the United States.He has deals with big brands like Red Bull and Panini America and more.

Forget passion.

Forget psychometric career tests.

Ask yourself: What is difficult for others, but easy for you?

What is that thing which takes people two hours, but you can do in ten minutes?

That’s your superpower.

Your unfair advantage.

Read full Letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

“Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift. More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.

Across the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.

Striking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.

Financially, it was a year of record performance. Revenue was $281.7 billion, up 15 percent. Operating income grew 17 percent to $128.5 billion. And Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time, up 34 percent. These results reflect the growing demand for our platform and the trust customers are placing in us. We take neither for granted.

We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Imagine a world where every person can get help from a researcher, a coder, or an analyst on demand. Not just information, but deep, contextual expertise paired with action. Or where every organization, no matter its size or sector, can reinvent employee experiences, reimagine customer engagement, reshape business processes, and bend the curve on innovation for their people, businesses, and industries. This is the new frontier and how we will unlock the next level of productivity and growth for the world.

But it is not some far off vision—we are already seeing what's possible when AI reaches the frontlines of human potential, helping small businesses become more productive, multinationals more competitive, nonprofits more effective, governments more efficient, and improving healthcare and education outcomes.

To share just a few examples across industries: Mercy, one of the largest health systems in the US, has saved caregivers over 100,000 hours by automatically documenting physician-patient encounters. As one physician put it: ""the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" A grandmother in Japan, who lost her hearing at age two, can now communicate with her voice, thanks to an AI app. A judge in Colombia is using Copilot to expedite due process and help tackle a backlog of court cases. Barclays Bank is putting AI in the hands of 100,000 employees, transforming the employee experience by simplifying how they access information and get things done. Ralph Lauren is helping customers find the perfect look for any occasion, thanks to a new conversational shopping experience. Carvana has reduced inbound calls per sale by 45 percent, freeing its staff to focus on complex, high-value support.

These examples, and so many others like them, are made possible by our clear focus on our priorities, our responsibility, and our culture.

OUR PRIORITIES

To deliver on our mission, we remain focused on three core business priorities as our North Star: security, quality, and AI innovation.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world. This year, we made significant progress across both our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI), but we recognize our work here is never done. We must continuously raise the bar for ourselves and our customers.

Security

Through SFI, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to our highest-priority security work. We strengthened identity protections, secured our networks and systems, enhanced threat detection and response, and embedded security-by-design practices across everything we build.

Quality

With QEI, we created frameworks that increase accountability and accelerate progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. This includes improvements to change management, incident management, platform resiliency, and service health.

Together, these initiatives are laying the foundation for a renaissance of our engineering culture, where we build planet-scale systems that power the world, with the security and quality they require.

AI innovation

At the same time, we have made major advances in AI innovation, including across two foundational areas: our Cloud and AI infrastructure, and our family of Copilots and agents.

Our Cloud and AI infrastructure

We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave. We opened new datacenters across six continents and now operate more than 400 datacenters in 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. This year alone, we added over two gigawatts of new capacity. Every Azure region is now AI-first and can support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And just last month, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in southeastern Wisconsin, which will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today.

We are also driving and benefiting from compounding improvements in silicon, systems, and models to improve performance and efficiency. And we continue to invest in sovereign cloud offerings to meet the unique data residency needs of governments and industries worldwide.

We have made meaningful progress on the next frontier in cloud systems: quantum. We announced Majorana-1, the first quantum chip with a topological core, and announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.

In data and analytics, Microsoft Fabric is becoming the unified platform for the AI era. It is now our fastest-growing analytics product ever, with 25,000 paid customers. OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including Power BI semantic models, making it the best foundation for building enterprise AI applications.

We also introduced Azure AI Foundry, a platform to design, customize, and run powerful AI apps and agents. Foundry includes access to more than 11,000 models from partners like OpenAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and others, ensuring our customers can choose from the best frontier and open models in one place. Already, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 use Foundry for their AI workloads.

And this fall we introduced our first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, a super-efficient natural voice generation model that can generate a minute of audio in less than a second on a single GPU, as well as MAI-1 preview, our first foundation model trained end-to-end in-house.

Copilots and agents

Our Copilot family of products is helping people thrive at home, at school, and at work. This year, we surpassed 100 million monthly active users across both commercial and consumer.

We rolled out a major update to Microsoft 365 Copilot this spring, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, and role-specific agents like Analyst and Researcher into a single experience. And earlier this month, we announced Agent Mode, which allows you to start with a simple prompt and then work iteratively with Copilot—steering it as it orchestrates multistep tasks to deliver high-quality Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Give Copilot a prompt like, ""Run a full analysis on this sales data set. I want to understand some important insights to help me make decisions about my business. Make it visual."" Agent Mode gets to work deciding which formulas to use, producing new sheets, and creating data visualizations. It's pretty remarkable.

Copilot Studio continues to grow as well, with more than 230,000 organizations using it to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot or to build their own agents using no-code/low-code tools.

In software development, GitHub Copilot now has more than 20 million users and has evolved into a peer programmer, capable of executing tasks on our behalf asynchronously. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is being used to document millions of clinical encounters, saving precious time that healthcare providers can spend on patients, not paperwork. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce AI agents that help defenders autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks.

On the consumer front, Copilot is now integrated across Bing, Edge, GroupMe, MSN,

Windows

, and

Xbox

. We also refreshed our Copilot consumer app this year as a more natural, conversational, and personal AI companion. One highlight is Copilot Mode in Edge, which lets you chat directly with your open tabs.

More broadly, we continue to expand our reach with consumers. LinkedIn is now home to 1.2 billion members, and we are bringing AI agents into the core workflows of sales, hiring, and learning. And across gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

At Microsoft, we have always believed that we do well when the world around us does well. We demonstrate this, year after year, by making progress on our commitments to create technology that benefits everyone on the planet, along with the planet itself.

This means that as we drive the AI economy, we are also providing the skills and opportunities for everyone to participate in it. That's why we launched Microsoft Elevate this year, an initiative that unites our technology, skills, research, and philanthropic investments, so AI can benefit every classroom, community, and cause. Over the next five years, we will invest $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofit organizations. And we will partner with organizations like UNICEF, Code.org, and more to extend AI skilling opportunities to people around the globe.

Our skilling initiatives will help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years, from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. And to support our work with deeper research and policy insights, our new AI Economy Institute will explore how AI is reshaping education and work, helping us bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

We are also focused on empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools, making Microsoft 365 Copilot Personal free for 12 months for every college student in the United States. And we're introducing new LinkedIn courses for teachers and students, enabling them to earn LinkedIn certifications that will help boost their resumes and open doors.

Across all of this, one thing is clear: People want technology they can trust. That's why we are committed to driving responsible AI innovation and building safe and secure technology. As we do, we are guided by our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. They are built into the design of our software and services, the security of our data, our privacy protections, and our engagement with employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and governments around the world.

As a multinational company, we remain dedicated to creating jobs, promoting economic opportunities, and strengthening cybersecurity, digital stability, sovereignty, and resilience globally. In Europe, we announced five commitments to strengthen digital stability this year. They start with an expansion of our cloud and AI infrastructure, so every country can compete in the global economy. And they include a promise to uphold Europe's digital resilience regardless of geopolitical and trade volatility.

Responsible business practices are embedded across our operations and supply chain. Following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we've strengthened our due diligence processes, expanded stakeholder engagement, and launched new governance mechanisms to ensure accountability. Our second annual Responsible AI Transparency Report highlighted our work to build and deploy AI responsibly. This includes developing new AI tools and resources to help our customers innovate within evolving regulatory requirements.

Another key component of earning trust is contributing to a safer online ecosystem, including protecting those who use our services from illegal and harmful content and conduct. We continue to take new steps to advance safety, especially for children, while balancing our commitments to free expression and privacy. Over the past year, we've focused on addressing risks related to abusive AI-generated content and partnered with StopNCII.org to detect victim-reported imagery in Bing.

Our solutions, partnerships, and programs reach people and organizations of all abilities to help them thrive. More than 5 million people have participated in our AI Skilling programs focused on accessibility. We launched new technology to help people with disabilities play, work, and live—through an Adaptive Joystick for Xbox, sign language detection in Teams, low-vision keyboards for Surface, and AI-powered visual descriptions in Windows.

2025 also marked the midpoint in our journey to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company, and to protect more land than we use. We are on track to meet many of our targets and continue to accelerate progress for others.

Our renewable energy procurement increased from 1.8 GW in 2020 to 34 GW in 2024, and we contracted nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal—playing a pivotal role in scaling the carbon removal market. We provided more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation and plan to replenish more than 100 million cubic meters of water around the world. We are getting closer to zero waste through new Circular Centers, which contribute to the reuse and recycling of nearly 91 percent of servers and components decommissioned from our datacenters. And we've reached nearly 95 percent recyclability in our product packaging.

We are learning how to make AI more sustainable by design and improve AI-powered solutions. Platforms like our Planetary Computer and our AI for Good Lab are helping us find new ways to address the world's most pressing challenges.

Making progress on these commitments takes time. But here, too—we are guided by a bold vision, thinking in decades and executing in quarters.

OUR CULTURE

Amid this rapid progress, our culture is more important than ever. The AI platform shift is reshaping not just our products and business models, but how we work.

Our growth mindset is essential to our ability to continue leading this AI era. It enables us to innovate both within Microsoft and with those we serve. We must be learn-it-alls, willing to experiment, guided by evaluations, and committed to continuous improvement. I am continually impressed by how our people do just that.

We are focused on being Customer Zero, applying AI to reduce toil and improve flow in our own work while creating a playbook we can share with the world.

We're also embracing a new way of working—one that expands job scopes, reduces handoffs, and gives teams tools to scale productivity in nonlinear ways. This isn't just about driving efficiency. It's about empowering our people to dream bigger and get to ""job complete"" faster, with less friction and greater impact than ever before.

Our employees also continue to find ways to bring their purpose and passion to the causes and communities they care deeply about. This year, they volunteered over 1.2 million hours and gave $263 million (including company match) to 37,000 nonprofit organizations in 110 countries.

In July, after we reported our earnings results—including surpassing $75 billion in annual Azure revenue for the first time—I shared a reflection with all employees. Fifteen years ago, when we set out on our cloud journey, we had a bold vision, and we persisted through all the ups and downs.

I asked our team: What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, ""we got it right""? Hundreds of answers poured in spanning near-term priorities and long-term ambitions alike:

""Helping the world be safe from cybercrime"" ""Speech is now a standard human-machine interface"" ""Using AI to improve the lived experience for people with disabilities"" ""We changed the way people learn"" ""Access to millions of agents powered by orders of magnitude larger models"" ""Medical knowledge has become ambient, embedded in clinical workflows""

""We helped billions become skilled in AI""

These responses and so many others reflected a deep sense of purpose and belief in what's possible. And that is precisely what is needed for us to succeed. Microsoft has an immense opportunity and responsibility—not just in building these futures, but in helping shape the world's future. And I'm confident that together, we can continue to think in decades and execute in quarters on this journey to empower us all.

From STEM-focused to problem-finding roles, Cognizant’s approach to hiring graduates









Cognizant is ramping up entry-level hiring as artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, with CEO Ravi Kumar S telling Fortune the company is bringing on more school graduates this year than ever before—and he's looking beyond traditional tech majors to liberal arts colleges and community colleges.Kumar's unconventional hiring strategy stems from his belief that AI will widen the base of corporate employment rather than shrink it. ""I can take a school graduate and give them the tooling so they can actually punch above their weight,"" he told Fortune. ""AI is an amplifier of human potential. It's not a displacement strategy.""The CEO of the 350,000-employee IT consulting firm is actively recruiting non-STEM graduates, including anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and journalists. His rationale: as expertise becomes accessible at everyone's fingertips through AI, specialisation loses its premium. ""Intelligence is not the asymmetry. Applying intelligence is the asymmetry,"" Kumar explained.He urged students to ""start to focus on interdisciplinary skills,"" citing examples like historians blending computational skills to become futurists or biology majors using AI to crack drug development cycles.According to Kumar, the corporate pyramid is becoming ""broader and shorter,"" with faster paths to expertise for those who can leverage AI tools effectively.Kumar sees AI handling the ""middle"" work—the execution and problem-solving—while humans focus on the beginning (prompting, conceptualising, finding purposeful problems) and the end (validation and verification). This shift means companies need more ""problem finders"" rather than just problem solvers, opening doors for disciplines traditionally outside tech's core.The shift extends beyond hiring. Cognizant has launched apprenticeship programs in 30 states and partnered with Merit America for mid-career shifts, offering a ""work, earn and learn"" model. Kumar acknowledges a critical caveat: AI's benefits must be ""distributed equitably"" rather than concentrated among a few to truly boost productivity and create wage distribution.""As people are living longer, the life of their skills is getting shorter,"" Kumar noted, emphasising that future workers will need multiple careers in one lifetime—making adaptable, interdisciplinary skills more valuable than narrow expertise.","Cognizant is hiring more school graduates this year than ever before.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","X witnessing executive exodus amid strategic churn.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.","Airbnb ceo brian chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella lists 3 new Copilot features that he ‘can't stop using’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-lists-3-new-copilot-features-that-he-cant-stop-using/articleshow/124821560.cms,"Voice-activated Copilot on Windows

Mico : “The Socratic Tutor”

Planning, learning, and staying 'Insane'





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s Copilot AI assistant that he claims have become indispensable to his daily work and personal life. Nadella touted the features as major advances in how humans interact with technology, comparing one innovation to the introduction of touchscreens.Nadella shared his top three “daily habits” in a short video clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), emphasising the rapid pace of development within Microsoft's AI initiatives.Nadella called the voice-activated Copilot on his Windows laptop the most exciting new way to interact with a computer since touch technology was introduced. The CEO described the feature as essentially giving him “a new mouse, and it just happens to be voice.” This allows him to instantly invoke Copilot while working on emails or documents and ask it questions.“I can just invoke Copilot and ask it questions. It retrieves information, and it's just fantastic to have,” Nadella said, praising it as the most exciting ""new modality"" to emerge since touch.The second feature the CEO highlighted is Mico, a new character interface for Copilot.Nadella praised Mico for transforming the AI interaction by giving it ""a face to talk to.""He described Miko as a Socratic tutor, capable of not just providing information but truly teaching the user. Nadella shared a personal example, noting how he and his daughter used Miko to explore Egyptian mythology.“The cool thing about it is it taught us both what we wanted, you know, not just give us information and it's just wonderful,” he stated.The third feature Nadella mentioned, though less specific, focuses on Copilot's utility in managing complex life and work demands. He lauded its capabilities in “planning, learning, coordinating,” and helping him “stay sane.”“So I think these three things are definitely becoming my go-to features on a daily basis,” he said.Nadella concluded his endorsement by encouraging users to try out the new functionalities, stating: ""We are building fast. Try these features out. Tell us what you think.""",Microsoft ceo satya nadella has highlighted three new features within the company’s copilot ai assistant that he claims have become indispensable to his daily work and personal life.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

Explained: What is the BritCard Digital ID controversy?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/explained-what-is-the-britcard-digital-id-controversy/articleshow/124806132.cms,"The Big Picture

The Road Ahead

The Bottom Line





When Prime Minister Keir Starmer stood before cameras on 26 September 2025 to unveil Britain’s first national digital ID, he called it a “modern solution for a modern country.”The BritCard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy — applying for jobs, renting homes, opening bank accounts.Within hours, it had done something else entirely: trigger a nationwide debate about surveillance, data rights and state overreach in a country that famously scrapped its last ID card plan fifteen years ago.The BritCard Digital ID is designed to serve as a single digital credential for identity verification.It builds on the GOV.UK One Login programme and will be free for all citizens and residents with the right to live and work in the UK.Starmer argued the system would reduce paperwork and save up to £85 in private verification fees. But the plan’s link to employment verification — BritCard will be required for all new jobs and housing rentals — has blurred the line between voluntary and mandatory use.Polls now show public support slipping to -14%, with over 1.4 million online engagements dominated by scepticism.The digital ID’s rollout follows Labour’s broader attempt to modernise governance and tighten control over illegal migration.Officials claim BritCard will cut fraud, speed up background checks and create a secure, encrypted system without a centralised database.However, the scheme’s announcement was met with social media backlash.Community notes on X (formerly Twitter) challenged Starmer’s claims on verification costs, while privacy campaigners accused the government of “rebranding the old ID card under a digital label.”The BritCard revives one of Britain’s most divisive policy ideas — national identity verification — in a new digital form.The UK’s last attempt, under Tony Blair in the 2000s, was scrapped in 2010 after concerns about surveillance and cost overruns.Critics say the BritCard risks repeating that history.They warn of function creep, where a voluntary system quietly becomes required for access to essential services, echoing fears around China’s social credit model or India’s Aadhaar before reforms introduced stronger privacy rules.Civil liberty groups like Big Brother Watch warn BritCard could create a “checkpoint society,” allowing the state to track everyday activities.Cybersecurity experts say connecting multiple databases under one digital identity increases the risk of breaches and identity theft.People without smartphones or reliable internet could face new barriers in employment and housing.Opposition MPs, including former minister David Davis, argue that “voluntary today” could become “compulsory tomorrow,” especially once integrated with other services.Downing Street insists BritCard is secure, optional, and citizen-centred.Officials emphasise there will be no single national database and that the system will rely on encrypted credentials stored by users.The government claims the project will “restore trust in identity,” streamline background checks, and support law enforcement in tackling illegal working and benefit fraud.A Home Office spokesperson said the plan will “make life simpler for the law-abiding majority and harder for those exploiting the system.”Public sentiment remains sharply divided.On X, hashtags like #NoToBritCard and #StopDigitalID trended within hours of the launch.Civil rights groups have filed petitions urging Parliament to halt the rollout, warning it would “normalise constant verification.”Polling by Ipsos shows 57% of Britons back ID cards in theory, but only 38% support a purely digital version.Critics argue that the scheme’s success depends less on technology and more on trust, something successive British governments have struggled to maintain after multiple data scandals.The government plans a phased rollout starting with veterans and select public sector workers in 2026, before expanding nationwide.BritCard credentials could eventually integrate with driving licences, NHS records and tax accounts under the planned GOV.UK Wallet.The Home Affairs Committee has opened an inquiry into the proposal’s privacy, cybersecurity and equality implications.Its findings will likely shape how far and how fast the system proceeds.For Starmer, BritCard represents efficiency, innovation and control.For opponents, it symbolises state overreach dressed up as digital progress.The next year will test whether Britain’s digital identity revolution can convince citizens that convenience does not have to come at the cost of freedom.","The britcard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy.
