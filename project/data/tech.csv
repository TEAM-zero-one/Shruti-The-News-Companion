"Chennai Tax Evasion: IT dept detects more than Rs 1,000 crore tax evasion during searches on private company premises in Chennai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/it-dept-detects-more-than-rs-1000-crore-tax-evasion-during-searches-on-private-company-premises-in-chennai/articleshow/125916549.cms,"CHENNAI: The income tax department uncovered more than Rs 1,000 crore in tax evasion and detected a Rs 250crore unexplained investment in a Switzerland-based pharma company during ongoing search operations on the premises of Refex Group and its associates, the department said in a statement on Thursday.The investigation directorate, income tax department, Chennai, launched the searches on Tuesday, covering Refex Industries Ltd — the group’s flagship firm engaged in refrigerant gases, ash handling, power trading, and solar power — as well as financiers, hawala operators, and jewellery businesses linked to the promoters.Officials said the searches had exposed Rs 1,112 crore in bogus purchases, largely tied to coal procurement and ash-handling contracts. They also found that Refex Industries received Rs 382.68 crore in equity contributions from 53 individuals and entities, including 15 non-filers and 37 who failed to disclose the transactions in their tax returns. Many of the contributors are employees or associates of the promoters, raising suspicion that the entire investment is unexplained money routed through benami entities.Documents seized during the search showed the group’s US$30 million investment in Swiss pharma firm Astro Viz, the source of which is now being probed. Investigators also flagged Rs 115 crore invested in DN Energy Ltd, which was allegedly diverted immediately after creditThe department further found that the promoter created shell companies in the name of his driver, through which Rs 8.5 crore in cash deposits and over Rs 200 crore in transactions were routed.Officials said he also spent heavily on a Rs 37 crore private jet, Rs 10 crore in luxury cars, and Rs 4 crore in high-end watches.In parallel action, searches were conducted on financier Rajesh Surana, who reportedly advanced Rs 312 crore to Aradhya Infra, which then loaned the funds onward. The role of hawala operators who helped channel more than Rs 10 crore through illegal non-banking routes is also being examined.So far, the department detected over Rs 1,000 crore in unaccounted income and recovered Rs 70 crore in unaccounted cash, gold, and silver. Further investigation is ongoing.“The search and related processes initiated by the authorities are currently under way, and Refex Group, along with all its subsidiaries and employees, is fully cooperating with the officials to ensure a smooth and transparent completion of the procedure. Our business operations continue as usual,” the company said in statement on Thursday.“Refex Group has always operated with a strong commitment to legal compliance, ethical conduct and regulatory transparency, and will continue to do so. We request all stakeholders and the public at large to avoid spreading and/or relying on any speculative unauthenticated information’s unless the same are officially verified information(s)released by the competent authorities,” it said.","Income tax department uncovered more than rs 1,000 crore in tax evasion and detected a rs 250crore unexplained investment in a switzerland-based pharma company.

Clocking out, calling it out: How three generations are quietly (and not-so-quietly) redefining office life

“Being ready to be there for the company whenever it demands.”

“Always comparing who does more work and who doesn't, mostly in a fun way but it gets you sometimes.”

Walk into any corporate office today, and you’re likely to witness a scene that feels less like a workplace and more like a group project assigned by the universe. On one end of the floor, a Boomer is carefully crafting an email that begins with “Dear Team,” while a GenZ intern is wondering why the email wasn’t simply replaced by a three-second voice note. In between them sits a Millennial, holding a reusable coffee cup and the emotional weight of being sandwiched between two generations who insistwere raised the hard way.Welcome to the modern office: a place where three generations collide daily, armed with their own communication styles, work philosophies, and deeply held opinions. For example, whether “…” at the end of a message is a passive-aggressive statement or simply a grammatically correct continuation. It’s a space where Boomers are still trying to understand why anyone needs a “mental health day,” Millennials are trying to avoid burnout for the third time this quarter, and GenZ is trying to figure out how to turn their hobby into a side hustle during lunch break.While all three cohorts technically have the same job descriptions, they often approach work like they’re playing different levels of the same video game. Boomers operate by the rulebook, because of course therea rulebook, and have mastered the fine art of surviving long meetings without blinking.Millennials rely on collaboration, Google Docs, and the burning desire to appear competent at all times. GenZ, meanwhile, is speedrunning corporate life with tabs open to both the shared drive and Instagram reels.Yet for all their differences, what makes this intergenerational mash-up particularly entertaining is just how much each group believes the others are a little bit unusual. Boomers think Millennials take too many notes. Millennials think Boomers send emails like they’re writing novels. GenZ thinks everyone sends too many emails altogether.Still, somehow, work gets done. Projects are completed, presentations are delivered, and HR quietly updates its conflict-resolution guidelines every quarter. What looks like chaos from the outside is, in reality, a delicate balancing act: Boomers bring consistency, Millennials bring efficiency, and GenZ brings innovation with a dash of existential comedy.So if you’ve ever wondered why the office feels like a sitcom missing its laugh track, you’re simply witnessing the daily dance of three generations doing their best to navigate a changing work culture, one shared spreadsheet and misunderstood emoji at a time.Baby Boomers or Boomers, Millennials and Generation Z are often spoken about in shorthand, but each group comes with its own backstory and work style shaped by the times they grew up in. Baby Boomers, born roughly between 1946 and 1964, are the only generation officially defined by a government body, the US Census Bureau, named after the post–World War Two surge in births, as cited by the BBC. In the workplace, they’re known for being committed, self-sufficient and competitive, traits that perhaps come from growing up in a crowded, fast-growing world where standing out mattered.Millennials, born approximately between 1980 and the mid-1990s, are the most debated and stereotyped generation, often unfairly labelled as “lazy” or frivolous. In reality, they were the first true digital natives, growing up alongside the internet, which made them confident, curious and highly self-reliant.GenZ, the youngest cohort, includes those born in the late 1990s or early 2000s and has never known a world without smartphones, social media or constant connectivity. Often called iGen, they are ambitious, tech-savvy and confident, entering workplaces with fresh expectations and an instinctive comfort with digital tools. Together, these generations bring very different perspectives to the same office floor, shaped not just by age, but by history, technology and the worlds they grew up navigating.When asked,Aastha Jha, a member of Generation Z, didn’t hesitate:Soumya Banerjee, working in an IT firm, shared a different frustration. He pointed to a familiar pattern he’s noticed among seniors:The woes of a millennial are quite different. On asked how it feels to be sandwiched between the boomers and GenZs, Natasha said, “while millenials have been at the end of Boomer toxic culture, it is a nice spot to be in. While we have grown up listening to stories about the times they had to work during serious physical illnesses, the humour of a GenZ asking for a leave because they 'are not feeling the vibes' is not lost on you. ”Sneha had a simple answer for the question of whether she had ever felt judged for logging off exactly on time:When a Boomer was asked, 'what is the biggest change you have noticed in workplace culture?', the response reflected decades of experience: “There has been a big change in workplace culture in 20–25 years, and most of the changes have been for the better. The pace of work has increased, and people have adapted to that pace. Twenty-five years ago, no matter which sector you were working in, the availability of technological tools was not as easy. There was no AI, social media, or even computers were not as actively used as they are currently. So the pace has increased due to new technology being introduced. And secondly, you have a younger workforce in every field. People have been taking up responsibilities that could only be taken by someone senior.”Coming from someone who has been part of the workforce for the past 30 years, the reflection highlights how technology and a younger workforce have reshaped how fast work gets done.He also noted that the younger generation needs to develop 'ownership of work', something that they can learn from the work ethics of the older generation. ""People do a lot of work, but at times, you feel that there is no ownership of that specific work,"" he said.HR professionals, on the other hand, today find themselves acting as cultural interpreters, peacekeepers as they navigate the competing expectations of all three generations. They must balance Boomers’ preference for structure and visibility with Millennials’ need for flexibility and Gen Z’s insistence on boundaries and mental well-being.This often means redesigning policies, rewriting communication norms, and mediating misunderstandings that arise from everything from email etiquette to attitudes toward overtime. For HR, the challenge isn’t choosing sides, it’s creating a workplace ecosystem where all three generations feel heard, respected, and able to collaborate without turning every team meeting into a generational tug-of-war.When asked whether the recruitment strategy has undergone any significant changes to accommodate younger professionals, Karan , an HR executive, said, “The strategy has undergone a significant transformation, now prioritising Authenticity and Investment in Marketability to secure the newest wave of talent. Messaging focuses less on abstract corporate rhetoric and more on demonstrating the company's commitment to tangible skill development and job security, appealing directly to the risk-averse nature of younger professionals. Recruitment outreach is concentrated on high-engagement digital forums and specialised professional networks, employing candid employee testimonials to convey a transparent, genuine culture.”He also explains that for Millennials, staying with a company often depends on seeing a clear, fast-paced career path and knowing the organisation is genuinely committed to social impact through its CSR or ESG efforts. When it comes to older professionals, he says the key is to position them in meaningful advisory roles and provide strong technical support, so their deep experience and institutional knowledge remain an active part of the company’s modern, hybrid way of working.Ultimately, the generational divide in today’s workplaces is less about conflict and more about coexistence in transition. Boomers, Millennials, and GenZ are all responding to the same pressures, faster work, changing technologies and evolving ideas of success, just in different ways, shaped by their experiences. As offices continue to adapt, the challenge is not to declare one generation “right” and another “wrong,” but to find common ground where experience meets adaptability and ambition meets balance. As work culture evolves, offices have the chance to become spaces that value both productivity and people, whether that’s through a formal “Dear Team,” a sharp log-off, or a “no vibes today” day off.","Baby boomers, millennials and generation z are often spoken about in shorthand.

Evolving financial position driven by expanding careers

Projected net worth trajectory of Jey Uso and Takecia Travis through 2025

Jey Uso's financial picture has really taken off in recent years, thanks to the WWE giving him a big push as a singles performer. This has sent his yearly earnings soaring almost $1 million, which has helped put his personal net worth at about $3 million. This is considered massive for any WWE wrestler in 2025.Takecia Travis, on the other hand, keeps a pretty low profile outside of the wrestling world but throws in around $200,000 from family investments and a small business or two. So when you put their finances together, the Uso's have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million. You can see how their wealth has just grown steadily as Jey's star has risen and Takecia's been quietly handling the day-to-day stuff.Jey's pay varies depending on the storyline of the match. For now, he's in that top end of the WWE salary bracket, which, of course, is great for the couple's long-term financial prospects as they're still getting paid out for appearances and merch as well.His connection to the Anoa’i family sustains long-term demand, giving him opportunities beyond weekly programming, such as live-event bonuses and external partnerships that contribute meaningfully to his income.Takecia keeps a pretty low profile but is just as crucial to the show as she's the one who manages the family day to day and keeps the spending in check when Jey's on the road and wrestling schedules get all over the place.Their financial situation is growing but it's a steady & predictable thing. Not huge leaps forward but more like a gentle rise that matches the rhythm of Jey's wrestling career and the long-term plans they have.Jey’s singles popularity continues trending upward, and WWE’s investment in keeping him on major cards means he is likely to maintain or slightly increase his earnings through the year. His marketability tends to go up any time the company decides to go all in on the Bloodline storyline, which usually causes merch sales and appearance paydays to skyrocket.Takeica's financial impact remains pretty low-key but sensible, shoring up the household with a steady hand and a level head, whilst Jey's schedule is looking more like a rollercoaster than a predictable train ride.All things considered, theyre probably poised for some steady financial progress rather than an overnight success, thanks to a steady supply of WWE cash and some solid long-term thinking on family planning.Also Read: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event: John Cena's final match, full match card, preview, date, start timings for all regions, how to watch, and more details",Jey uso and takecia travis have a combined net worth of about $3.2 million.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles. WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

By 2025, Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have built a life that blends elite sport with global pop culture.

He stayed effective well into the later years of his career, allowing him to maximize earnings when experience mattered most. With career earnings projected to pass $400 million by 2026, his financial legacy reflects durability more than hype.Kate Upton’s net worth (according to Celebrity Net Worth) in 2025 is estimated between $20 million and $30 million. Her rise began with iconic Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue appearances that turned her into a global fashion name. High-profile campaigns followed, bringing steady income during her peak modeling years.Acting roles in films such as The Other Woman expanded her reach, but her recent focus has shifted toward beauty, fitness, and brand partnerships. Today, her earnings come from influence, ownership, and staying selective about where her name appears.Together, Justin Verlander and Kate Upton have a combined net worth estimated at around $220 million in 2025.

Upton adds flexibility through fashion, media, and business ventures.Their shared wealth is built on careers that grew steadily and evolved with time.

TCS Layoffs: Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar gives written reply in Vidhan Parishad on TCS layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maharashtra-labour-minister-aakash-fundkar-gives-written-reply-in-vidhan-parishad-on-tcs-layoffs/articleshow/125886840.cms,"TCS layoffs: Legislative concerns

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Around 376 employees of tata consultancy services (tcs) were laid off at the company’s pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year.

Rewards and Final Tips for Fighting Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO

We can encountertoday, Sunday, December 14, 2025, dominating Power Spots from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time in a limited three-hour Max Battle Day. This is one of the most rewarding Max events to date, blending shiny hunting, massive XP gains, and high-end resource farming into a single afternoon.For trainers chasing progression rather than just Pokédex entries, this event is tailor-made. With boosted Max Particles, large-scale group battles of up to 40 players, and some of the best Stardust and XP payouts available in Max Battles, Gigantamax Snorlax offers both efficiency and spectacle in equal measure.Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO appears exclusively at Power Spots as a Tier 6 Max Battle. Each entry costs 800 Max Particles, which are refunded only if you win. Power Spots refresh frequently throughout the event, encouraging fast chaining of battles.From midnight until the event ends, trainers benefit from reduced adventuring distance for Max Particle collection, 8x Max Particles from Power Spots, and doubled particles from exploration.Timed Research running since December 8 rewards Dynamax Machop encounters, Candy, and Max Particles to help players prepare optimal counters.An optional Ultra Ticket priced at $4.99 boosts the Max Particle cap to 5,600, grants double XP from Max Battles (up to 100,000 XP per fight with a Lucky Egg), and provides extra trades for those coordinating remotely. Shiny Gigantamax Snorlax is available, with catch CP ranging from 1760 to 1843 at Level 20, with 1843 representing a perfect IV.As a pure Normal-type Pokémon, Gigantamax Snorlax in Pokemon GO is only weak to Fighting-type moves and completely resists Ghost-type attacks. It uses no Fast Moves, allowing players to freely spam theirs to build the Max Meter quickly.The boss has two Charged attacks: an undodgeable AoE move that hits all active Pokémon, and a powerful single-target attack that deals double damage but provides a visual cue for dodging. Successfully avoiding this attack is key to keeping attackers alive in smaller groups.Machamp is the undisputed MVP of this event, especially Shadow, Mega, or Dynamax variants. Powering counters to Level 30+ and maximizing Max Attack significantly improves Dynamax damage output.Ideal groups split into subteams of four: two attackers led by Machamp, one tank such as Dynamax Blissey or Gengar, and one healer using Blissey with Max Spirit or Max Guard at Level 3. Focus exclusively on Fast Attacks until Dynamax activates.Sixteen to twenty trainers is the practical minimum, while full 40-player lobbies clear battles fastest. Shields activate during Dynamax phases, drawing boss damage away from attackers. Rotate Dynamax users to preserve damage dealers, and use Max Mushrooms to double Dynamax damage when running smaller groups.Each successful battle awards 25,000 XP, 25,000 Stardust, one Rare Candy XL, 30 Snorlax Candy, one Candy XL, and 10 Premier Balls. Lucky Eggs and Star Pieces double XP and Stardust, making this one of the best grind windows of the season.Chain battles efficiently, coordinate via Discord for remote teams, and farm multiple Snorlax for Candy XL and Max Particle returns. While Gigantamax Snorlax has niche Max Battle utility, today’s real value lies in the rewards and they are massive.","Gigantamax snorlax in pokemon go appears exclusively at power spots as a tier 6 max battle.

'You might try hiring...': JD Vance's solution to H-1B row as states challenge Donald Trump's $100K visa fee,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-might-try-hiring-jd-vances-solution-to-h-1b-row-as-states-challenge-donald-trumps-100k-visa-fee/articleshow/125953734.cms,"Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded

When JD Vance said H-1B didn't make any sense to him





Vice President JD Vance reacted to the new H-1B row as states now challenge the Donald Trump administration's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, and said the states can instead try hiring Americans. Vance was reacting to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield's social media post on suing the new fee, calling it illegal. Dan Rayfield said the new fee would create a costly barrier for employers, especially public sector and government employers who can't pay such a fee if they want to hire from outside.""You might try hiring Americans,"" the vice president posted, giving a solution to the H-1B problem Dan Rayfield raised.""This is instructive, though. While I know there are many people in our coalition who--rightly--are angry about immigration fraud in our visa system, America Last Republicans and Democrats are teaming up to stop our efforts to address these issues. Don't black pill. Fight back,"" JD Vance said.California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Nevada are the 20 states challenging the H-1B visa fee.""The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including Oregon, where the flagship universities consistently depend on H-1B visa holders to fill faculty, researcher, and staff roles. For example, Oregon State University currently sponsors more than 150 H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff, and intends to hire additional faculty, researchers, and staff through the H-1B program. Eliminating access to H-1B faculty, researchers, and staff would inflict significant institutional harm, depriving students of critical educational opportunities,"" Dan Rayfield said.Rayfield said the University of Oregon sponsors more than 50 H-1B faculty, researchers and staff. An initial H-1B petition takes between $960 to $7,595 in regulatory and statutory fees. ""The Trump Administration’s $100,000 fee far exceeds the actual cost of processing H-1B petitions. By imposing this fee, the Administration is exceeding the fee-setting authority granted by Congress, which requires that fees be set based on the agency’s costs, rather than arbitrarily,"" Rayfield said.JD Vance is known for his strong stand against H-1B. Recently, he rapped tech companies for laying off Americans and hiring foreigners. He said it did not make any sense to him. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me. That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bullshit story,"" Vance said earlier this year.","20 states are challenging the donald trump administration's $100,000 h-1b visa fee.

Social media vetting from December 15





As the State Department begins social media vetting of all visa applicants, primarily H-1B, H-4 but also students and other non-immigrant visas, immigration lawyer Brad Bernstein explained that now there is unlikely to be any instant visa approval and immigration officials will go through all social media profiles of a candidate -- looking for contradictions. If the social media profiles are locked, then there are chances that the visa request will be instantly canceled.Bernstein explained that immigration officials have been asked to check Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Snapchat, but the scrutiny may not remain limited to these popular social media platforms. They may check any resume posted on the Internet, any blog in your name or a YouTube comment -- practically anything that comes up on the Internet on the applicant's name.The lawyer advised that applicants must fix any contradictions in their online profiles before the visa interview, after they make them public. They should also Google themselves to check what all comes up when their name is searched. ""They’re looking for inconsistencies, signs of immigrant intent that you may want to stay in the US looking for a Green Card, hostile statements about the United States, support for extremist groups, questionable work history, or signs that posts were deleted after filing,"" the lawyer said.""If your visa form says you are a full-time engineering student, but your LinkedIn shows freelance work or you are driving an Uber, now you have a credibility issue. You made a post somewhere or a comment: 'I can't wait to live in America forever', now you have an immigrant intent,"" Bernstein said, adding that applicants should not delete anything after filing as it would make things worse.Consular offices have been asked to go through the social media accounts of the visa applicants starting from December 15. As an immediate impact of that, visa appointments of the second half of December have been pushed to next year, after March -- leaving many H-1B candidates stuck in India for an indefinite period now.","State department begins social media vetting of all visa applicants from december 15.

Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there successfully. The rover’s work will provide valuable data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the moon’s far side.

"Why robotics pioneer, the Roomba co-creator, is skeptical about his field",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-robotics-pioneer-the-roomba-co-creator-is-skeptical-about-his-field/articleshow/125956719.cms,"



In the 1980s, limitations on computing constrained robot development. Watching insects, pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks realised that they possessed little brainpower but were far more capable than his robots, and that mimicking animal biology was smarter than trying to control every aspect of a robot’s behaviour through code. His successes led him to predict robots “everywhere in our world.”At 70, the former MIT lab director and a co-creator of the popular Roomba robot vacuum lives in that world. But Brooks, who has spent his career making intelligent machines a part of everyday life, finds himself playing the skeptic.Today’s entrepreneurs promise robots that not only look human — or human-ish — but can also do everything a person can. Tech investors are pouring billions into the effort, but Brooks argues that general-purpose humanoid robots will not be coming home soon, and that they are not safe enough to be around humans.In Sept, he delivered a takedown in an essay that concluded that over the next 15 years, “a lot of money will have disappeared, spent on trying to squeeze performance, any performance, from today’s humanoid robots. But those robots will be long gone and mostly conveniently forgotten.”His blog post kicked off a furore in the small world of robotics. This was a legend in the field, whose insights had informed the humanoid craze.“At least a dozen people asked me if I agreed with it shortly after it went live (I don’t),” wrote Chris Paxton, a researcher in AI and robotics.Brooks remembers German technologist Ernst Dickmanns’ self-driving car, which began motoring across Europe in 1987. He was around when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and when AI researcher Geoff Hinton predicted in 2016 that radiology would be obsolete in five years because machine learning software could do it better. All of these were important developments, but drivers, chess players and radiologists are still among us.Brooks insists he is simply being practical. “We’re going to go through a big hype, and then there’s going to be a trough of disappointment,” he said in an interview.The physical appearance of a robot, Brooks likes to say, makes a promise about what it can do. Robots in wide use today are designed for specific jobs in specific situations, and look like it — an arm that does the same repetitive action on a manufacturing line, or the automated pallet movers in Amazon warehouses. They aren’t flashy. “People see the humanoid form,” he said, “and they think it’s going to be able to do everything a human can. ”Brooks said he wouldn’t get within three feet of a humanoid bot. If — when, he says — they lose balance, the powerful mechanics that make them useful make them dangerous.The current humanoid craze is “kind of his fault,” said Anthony Jules, Brooks’ co-founder and CEO at Robust.AI, which is building automated carts for distribution centres. Jules was an MIT undergrad in the 1990s when Brooks was leading the school’s Computer Science and AI Laboratory — helping create the algorithms behind today’s autonomous cars, pioneering the feedback loops that link AI and robotics.Brooks, who grew up in Australia, arrived at Adelaide’s Flinders University in 1972 at the same time as academic refugees fleeing the end of the Prague Spring, allowing him to receive a “classical Eastern European mathematics education.” He spent 12 hours each Sunday futzing around with the university’s only mainframe computer. He cofounded his first AI startup in 1984 while teaching at Stanford.Brooks is particularly skeptical that neural networks are ready to solve the dexterity problem. Humans don’t have a language for gathering, storing and communicating data about touch. In his view, the visual data preferred by the new guard of robot startups simply won’t be able to re-create what we can do with our fingers.“My students have built lots of hands, my students have built lots of arms, shipped tens of thousands of robot arms,” Brooks said. “I’m very convinced that humanoid robots are not going to have human-level manipulation.”Brooks would say he is a realist, not a pessimist. His main worry is that too much focus on the trendiest training techniques will leave other promising ideas neglected. He expects that robots will someday work alongside people, and that we may even refer to them as humanoid — but they will be on wheels, he says, and have multiple arms and probably won’t be general purpose.He works above the mock-up warehouse in San Carlos, California, where Robust’s robots learn their trade, but he expects to retire in the next few years. Then, Brooks plan to write a book about the nature of intelligence, and why humans won’t create it artificially for another 300 years.","Former mit lab director and a co-creator of the popular roomba robot vacuum lives in that world.

Dem states sue over $100k H-1B fee as MAGA fumes over jobs flight to India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dem-states-sue-over-100k-h-1b-fee-as-maga-fumes-over-jobs-flight-to-india/articleshow/125951509.cms,".

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





A coalition of 20 US states led by Democratic attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit Friday challenging the Trump administration’s controversial $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, claiming the policy exceeds presidential authority and threatens US labor markets and critical services.The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts and spearheaded by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, argues that the fee far surpasses what federal law allows and was implemented without proper legal procedures. Traditionally, employers pay between roughly $960 and $7,600 in combined regulatory and statutory fees for H-1B petitions; the new six-figure surcharge represents an unprecedented jump.Democratic officials contend that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacked authority to impose such a steep fee without congressional approval and bypassed required notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act. They assert that the fee will dampen employers’ ability to hire skilled foreign professionals US industries rely on — particularly in tech, healthcare, research and education.State attorneys general emphasized the practical impacts of the rule, warning that schools, universities, hospitals and research institutions could struggle to fill specialized positions. Maryland’s AG noted teacher and researcher shortages, while Oregon and Vermont officials highlighted risks to local economies and public services that depend on H-1B workers, some 70 percent of whom are from India. Proponents of the fee say it is intended to curb perceived abuses of the H-1B system and protect US jobs. But Democratic critics counter that the policy will worsen labor shortages in critical sectors and undercut US competitiveness in science and technology.The states’ lawsuit adds to a broader legal and political battle over the H-1B system.
