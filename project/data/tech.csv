"Niti withdraws paper on GM crops import from US, signals govt stand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/niti-withdraws-paper-on-gm-crops-import-from-us-signals-govt-stand/articleshow/123196591.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.Though the US, during its trade negotiations with India, considered the stand as one of the non-tariff trade barriers, India preferred not to open up its market for GM food items over biosafety concerns, notwithstanding its primary think tank arguing in favour of import of transgenic soybean and corn without harming domestic production.The working paper on 'promoting India-US agricultural trade under the new US trade regime', released in May, had suggested that GM corn may be imported for ethanol blending and its by-products, like Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles. ""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","Niti aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper has given a peek into india's red-line on transgenic food items.

Elon Musk’s xAI has introduced Grok Imagine , a powerful new feature in its Grok AI platform that allows users to generate images and short video clips from simple text prompts. What’s making headlines, however, is its controversial “Spicy Mode” — a setting that reportedly enables the creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.This bold move places xAI in direct competition with major players, intensifying the race to dominate the multimedia generative AI space. As AI tools rapidly evolve from text to rich visual and video generation, Grok Imagine signals not just innovation, but a growing debate over the boundaries of creativity, ethics, digital consent, and AI responsibility.Grok Imagine is a generative AI tool that transforms text prompts into images and further enhances them into video clips with sound. By integrating multi-modal AI capabilities into a single user-friendly interface, Grok Imagine streamlines the creative process for users looking to produce custom visuals — from standard artwork to more experimental outputs.This mirrors recent industry developments like Midjourney’s new video-generation feature, showing that AI content generation is expanding rapidly beyond static imagery.The app generates a short video with audio.Grok Imagine is currently accessible through the Grok iOS app for Heavy and Premium+ subscribers, and for Heavy tier users on Android. The rollout aligns with xAI’s strategy to reserve advanced features for paid tiers, mirroring the premium access model used by other generative platforms.One of the most talked-about additions to Grok Imagine is its “Spicy Mode”, which, according to a report by TechCrunch, enables users to generate content that includes partial nudity and sexually suggestive visuals.Despite this, the app enforces content moderation. Users trying to push boundaries often receive blurred or blocked results. However, some semi-nude imagery has reportedly been generated during tests — raising questions about ethical AI boundaries and content safety.Grok Imagine competes directly with top AI tools like:Each platform has its strengths, but Grok Imagine’s inclusion of voice mode, video synthesis, and “Spicy Mode” sets it apart in terms of versatility and boldness.With Grok Imagine, xAI has added another innovative tool to the fast-growing AI ecosystem. The introduction of video generation from text, voice inputs, and visual prompts, combined with the controversial “Spicy Mode,” reflects a larger trend of merging entertainment, creativity, and technology in uncharted ways.Yet, the inclusion of NSFW capabilities — even with moderation — brings ethical and legal considerations into play, especially around AI-generated adult content.","Elon musk’s xai launches ‘grok imagine’ with nsfw mode. ‘spicy mode’ reportedly enables the creation of nsfw (not safe for work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123166551,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Realme Buds T200 Review: Vibrant Sound, Sleek Design

Epic Games is set to roll out Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Season 4 update, titled ""Shock 'N Awesome,"" very soon. However, ahead of the update’s release, the game is going through scheduled global downtime. This downtime is expected to end before the release of the Shock 'N Awesome update, which has rendered the game unplayable for players across the world. The upcoming update will focus on a mechanical insectoid bug invasion and will even feature a collaboration with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The new season's narrative centres around a bug invasion originating from the Kraken, which was summoned by the character Daigo.Players are waiting to jump into the latest content as soon as the scheduled downtime concludes. Here’s when the downtime is expected to end in the US, UK, Europe and more:Epic Games confirmed that server downtime for Fortnite's new season, introduced with patch v37.00, began at 2:00 AM ET (11:30 AM IST) on August 7, 2025. Matchmaking was disabled approximately 30 minutes earlier, at 1:30 AM ET (11:00 AM IST), marking the final window for players to join matches before the temporary maintenance period shutdown. Once a Fortnite season concludes, servers usually remain offline for about two to five hours before the next season becomes accessible.However, it can take much longer, like the 18-hour downtime before Chapter 5, Season 2. If things go smoothly, the servers will be back within the next few hours.Epic Games has announced that Fortnite’s v37.00 update is one of the most substantial seasonal updates so far, potentially requiring longer-than-usual downtime. While typical maintenance lasts, this one can last longer depending on deployment success.When Fortnite servers return, players will dive into a bug invasion storyline , with rift cracks in the sky and unstable map zones. New mobility-focused gameplay mechanics and Power Rangers-inspired Battle Pass items are expected. Technical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements will also roll out gradually after the v37.00 update.The patch also brings various bug fixes across Fortnite modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Save the World. Notable fixes include locker UI glitches, mobile control issues, and model display problems. These changes are based on player feedback and aim to improve performance and usability.","When will fortnite servers come back in us, uk, europe and other countries?

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Jeff bezos and lauren sánchez hosted leonardo dicaprio and his model girlfriend vittoria ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht koru.

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118181303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-809598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Set to directly compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Chinese DeepSeek and other AI chatbots, Grok 3 is claimed to offer 10 times the computational resources of its predecessor that was released in August last year. In a video call with the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Musk said “Grok 3 has very powerful reasoning capabilities, so in the tests that we've done thus far, Grok 3 is outperforming anything that's been released, that we're aware of, so that's a good sign”.During the conference, Musk termed Grok 3 as “scary smart”. He said: “At times I think Grok 3 is scary smart”. The chatbot is expected to run on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer, which reportedly uses over 100,000 Nvidia GPU hours to train AI models.

This is available for both the Grok app and our new website, grok.com.”“If you’re looking for a more polished version, it might be worth waiting a week, but expect improvements every day. We’re also working on a voice interaction feature so you can have a conversational experience. I tried it earlier today, and it’s working pretty well, though it still needs some polish. The goal is to make it so you can talk to it just like you would a person. I think it’s going to be one of the best experiences with Grok3, but that should be about a week away,” Elon Musk added.xAI said that Grok 3, its most advanced model yet, combining powerful reasoning abilities with a vast knowledge base. Trained on our massive Colossus supercluster, with ten times the computing power of previous cutting-edge models, Grok 3 shows significant improvements in reasoning, mathematics, coding, world knowledge, and following instructions.Grok 3's reasoning capabilities have been refined through extensive reinforcement learning.This allows it to analyze problems for extended periods, correcting errors, exploring different approaches, and ultimately delivering accurate solutions. Grok 3 excels in both academic benchmarks and real-world user evaluations, achieving a remarkable 1402 Elo score in the Chatbot Arena.","Xai said that grok 3, its most advanced model yet, combining powerful reasoning abilities with a vast knowledge base.

Thank you for your attention to this problem!” he further added.Trump’s remarks came shortly after senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel chairman Frank Yeary, raising concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s business connections.The letter questioned whether Tan had divested his interests in various semiconductor firms that reportedly have links to the Chinese Communist Party and China’s military.“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter.“Mr Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”The senator specifically highlighted Tan’s recent leadership at Cadence Design Systems, a tech company that had earlier admitted to selling products to China’s National University of Defense Technology in violation of US export rules.“US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton posted on X.Intel is among the major beneficiaries of President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act, having secured over $8 billion in federal funding to support the construction of chip plants across the United States.The company has yet to issue a response to either Trump’s post or Cotton’s letter.Following the controversy, Intel’s stock fell by 3%, even as broader markets, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, moved higher.Founded in 1968 during the early days of the personal computing era, Intel has struggled in recent years. It failed to keep pace with the mobile revolution sparked by Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and has since fallen behind more agile competitors. The rise of artificial intelligence has only widened that gap, with Nvidia emerging as a dominant force in the chipmaking industry.Now under Tan’s leadership since March, Intel is undergoing major restructuring. The company is cutting thousands of jobs, slashing expenses, and even scaling back some domestic semiconductor manufacturing, all in an effort to turn around its declining fortunes.","Us president donald trump called for the company’s chief executive to resign, citing alleged conflicts of interest involving ties to china.
