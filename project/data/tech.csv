NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday called upon the Indian IT sector to lead not just in service delivery but in building AI products, platforms and solutions that work for India and the world.""India's IT sector has been the backbone of our services exports and a key driver of economic growth. AI presents both a tremendous opportunity and a challenge for this sector... The fundamental shift is that AI isn't replacing the IT sector. It is transforming it,"" he told ANI.PM Narendra Modi said, ""While general-purpose AI tools have become widespread, enterprise-grade AI adoption is concentrated in specific sectors. Incumbent IT firms continue to play crucial roles in solving complex business problems.""Many saw the PM's remarks as nudging Indian software service players to develop new capabilities and work on products and platforms - something that many Indian IT companies are not known for despite sitting on large cash piles. Global tech giants are also facing challenges from AInative companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Modi said India must not only be a technology consumer but a creator too, a foundational pillar of the ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' principle. ""My vision is that India should be among the top three AI superpowers globally, not just in AI consumption but in creation.Our AI models will be deployed worldwide, serving billions in their native languages. Our AI startups will be valued in hundreds of billions, creating millions of high-quality jobs,"" the PM said.The PM also sought to address concerns over the impact of AI on jobs, vowing to arm the youth with requisite skills. ""I understand the concern of our youth about AI-driven disruptions in the job market. Preparation is the best antidote to fear. That is why we have been investing in skilling and re-skilling our people for an AI-driven future... We're not approaching this as a future problem but we're treating it as a present imperative,"" he said.""History has shown that work does not disappear due to technology. Its nature changes and new types of jobs are created. While some jobs may be redefined, digital transformation will also add new tech jobs to India's economy. History teaches us that whenever innovation happens, new opportunities emerge. The same will be true in the age of AI,"" Modi said.","Pm narendra modi calls upon indian it sector to lead in building ai products, platforms.

'Must Be Democratised': Vaishnaw Flags 'AI Divide', Hails Investments At India AI Impact Summit

NEW DELHI: The Centre spelt out an ambitious vision for artificial intelligence that borrows directly from one of India's biggest digital success stories - UPI.The idea, officials said, is to offer the world a ""bouquet of trusted AI solutions"": A shared, reliable digital backbone that countries and companies can build on, without being locked into proprietary platforms or paying royalties to a few dominant players.Electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Tuesday India wants to shape how AI is developed and governed globally by balancing innovation with accountability, using its own ""techno-legal"" approach rather than copying the EU's regulation-heavy framework or the US's market-driven model.Explaining the UPI parallel, Vaishnaw said India's strength lies in building frugal, low-cost engineering solutions that work at scale and can be shared as global public goods. ""We will be creating a bouquet of solutions, which have been tested on security and all possible parameters, and then we will present the same to the world for use and to build on,"" he said.Just as UPI was offered globally, India intends to share its AI capabilities in a similar spirit. ""We are not asking for any royalty or licence fee. We have given it as a common core,"" the minister said, adding several countries have already shown interest in adopting digital frameworks similar to India's.Vaishnaw said that this approach also defines sovereign AI, which he clarified does not mean cutting off global collaboration. ""Sovereign AI means having our own models, infrastructure, and ability to take solutions to a large number of people without remaining dependent on anybody else's approval,"" the minister said.The push comes amid global anxiety over AI - from job losses and volatile tech markets to fears of monopolisation by big tech firms.""A good consensus is emerging among global leaders that AI should be used for good and all harmful impacts should be contained,"" he said.To address workforce concerns, the minister said the govt is working on three tracks simultaneously: Reskilling the existing workforce, creating new talent pipelines, and updating education curricula. ""All three things are happening in parallel,"" the minister said.India is also scaling up its AI infrastructure, with plans to add 20,000 GPUs over the next six months to its common compute facility to support startups, researchers and students.","The idea is to offer the world a ""bouquet of trusted ai solutions"" india wants to shape how ai is developed and governed globally.

NEW DELHI: Days after its announcement in the Budget, the agriculture ministry on Tuesday launched AI-enabled ‘Bharat-VISTAAR’ (Virtually Integrated System to Access Agricultural Resources) that will help farmers in farm-level decision-making by receiving date-driven customised digital advisory.Launched at a time when India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, Bharat-VISTAAR is a multilingual AI tool that will integrate the AgriStack portals and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) package on farm practices with AI systems.Its use is expected to enhance farm productivity, enable better decisions for farmers and reduce risk by providing customised advisory support related to weather, market prices, pests and diseases, soil health, crop management, and information on major central govt schemes.Calling Bharat-VISTAAR a platform of “ask and get direct answers”, agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said farmers will neither have to make rounds of offices nor struggle with digital applications.“They will now just have to dial 155261 by picking up a mobile phone and ask any farm-related question. They will get immediate answer in one’s local language about which medicine (pesticide/insecticide) to apply, when to sow and what rates (of selling price of crops) are available in the markets of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Delhi or Mumbai,” Chouhan said while launching the first phase of Bharat-VISTAAR.The scheme, which is devised as an “AI-based digital security shield”, has initially been started in Hindi and English languages. Farmers will eventually be able to interact in 11 languages under the system in future.Chouhan said a farmer identity card was also being created under the system that would contain all information about the farmer. “Preparations are underway to connect the entire agricultural system with the Bharat VISTAAR scheme,” he added.Currently, a couple of central schemes such as ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ and ‘Soil Health Card’ have been included in this scheme. Information about all major central schemes for farmers will be available through it in due course.The minister on the occasion also unveiled AI Hackathon focused on farmers and ‘Agri Kosh AI Strategy Roadmap’, emphasising innovative solutions for agricultural challenges.","Bharat-vistaar is a multilingual ai tool that will integrate the agristack portals and the indian council of agricultural research (icar) package on farm practices with ai systems.

YouTube is facing a widespread outage. Thousands of users globally are currently experiencing issues with YouTube. Users have reported facing issues with loading videos from both the YouTube app and website. The problem is reportedly affecting streaming videos via both the YouTube app and website. According to outage tracking site DownDetector, thousands of users across regions, including the US, UK, and India, have complained of facing issues with the Google-owned video streaming platform. As per DownDetector, more than 240,000 reports were filed in the U.S. at the peak of the disruption and India registered 17,000 complaints.The data from DownDetetcor also highlight that around 56% users are facing issues with the app and 17% are not able to access the website. Whereas around 15% users are unable to login in YouTube. The YouTube users reported problems with video playback failure, login and account access issues and streaming interruptions on YouTube TV.Multiple online reports suggest that the outage seemed from a backend server configuration error.However, YouTube has not yer issued any detailed explanation about the outage.Users also posted about the YouTube outrage on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). “YouTube is currently down worldwide. Many users can’t open the app or play videos. It seems like a temporary server issue.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Opportunity for young workers



Mark Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies



American billionaire and former Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has now challenged the narrative that artificial intelligence will wipe out software jobs. As reported by Business Insider, in an interview with tech podcast TBPN, Cuban argued that AI adoption will actually lead to the creation of the millions of new roles, as tens of millions of US companies lack AI budgets or expertise. “There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI and that’s what people don’t understand,” Cuban said. “Every single company needs that.”Cuban also stressed on the fact that real opportunities lies in implementation, not just engineering. Cuban has advised the high school and college students to send time in learning how to use AI tools, make AI videos and also customise models so they can teach business leaders on how to harness the maximum potential of the technology.“This is where kids getting hired coming out of college are really going to have a unique opportunity,” he said, noting that younger workers are often more fearless in experimenting with AI compared to older employees.Recently, Cuban urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable.",Mark cuban has challenged the narrative that artificial intelligence will wipe out software jobs.

Citing over 1.5 million children in illegal labor, he emphasizes responsible sourcing and transparency. While experts note the issue is complex, his stance has renewed debate about supply chains, consumer responsibility, and ethical food production.

MrBeast turns snack brand into statement against child labor practices





Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is known for viral challenges and jaw-dropping giveaways. Now he is drawing attention for something far less flashy but far more serious. The YouTube megastar says the chocolate industry’s long-standing child labor problem pushed him to build a different kind of snack company. His brand, Feastables, is based on ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency on a time when consumers want to see rather than hear.Feastables was a new chocolate brand introduced by its creator in 2022 amidst a saturated market dominated by long-established brands. Rather than relying solely on the appeal to celebrities, he positioned the brand as an alternative, which is values-based. Donaldson is of the opinion that modern consumers, particularly young people are very concerned with the way their product is manufactured and where they were sourced.MrBeast recently highlighted a troubling statistic tied to cocoa production: “Over 1 million children work in child labor on cocoa farms so you can have cheap chocolate. I want to prove that this is a choice and not a necessity with Feastables. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on last 18 months. I’m thousands of hours deep on solving this. Won’t quit.""Cocoa farm child labor is highest in West Africa where poverty, poor regulation, and trade networks are hard to manage.The big chocolate firms have been promising reforms over a long time, but watchdog bodies still report a slow pace. Those discrepancies between the committed actions and quantifiable improvement have left a room in which new brands can make claims of cleaner sourcing at the very beginning.Feastables positions itself as a company that responsibly sources cocoa and has open partnerships. Analysts believe ethical sourcing is no longer a specialized selling point. It is turning out to be an expectation. The sheer scale of the reach of Donaldson in his online is a luxury. Millions of people listen when he speaks, and a lot of them are prepared to make their buying choices according to their values.Still, experts caution that solving child labor in cocoa production requires more than brand messaging. It demands economic reform, education access, and stronger governance in producing nations. Even so, Donaldson’s public stance has sparked renewed discussion about ethical consumption.By tying entertainment influence to supply chain ethics, MrBeast is testing whether digital creators can shape not only trends but also industry standards.","Mrbeast says the widespread use of child labor in cocoa farming inspired him to launch feastables.

As projects grow more complex, employers are seeking professionals who can deliver at scale and on deadline.The skyline is becoming a career map.Even in a diversifying market, authority carries weight. The Chief Financial Officer ranks second overall, with a mean monthly salary of ₹82,528 and a 171% increase in postings. Heads of sales, heads of marketing, principals, and human resources managers also feature among the top roles.These jobs rarely trend on social media. Yet they sit at the centre of decision-making, balancing budgets, steering growth, and navigating uncertainty. Companies, it appears, are willing to pay handsomely for judgement.Technology roles have not disappeared. The Python developer remains on the list, earning ₹34,798 per month. But hiring growth for the role stood at 0% year-on-year. That figure may be the most telling statistic in the entire ranking.For over a decade, tech defined aspiration. In 2026, it shares the stage.

Social media managers recorded 138% growth. Businesses are investing not only in production, but in perception and experience.Consumers want more than functionality. They want design, storytelling and curated journeys. The job market is responding accordingly.Indeed’s Best Jobs 2026 list was compiled by analysing Indian job posting data across five metrics: median salary in 2025, job volume, salary growth from 2022 to 2025, job posting growth over the same period, and availability of remote work options.To ensure reliability, only roles with at least 20% pay transparency and a minimum of 1,000 postings in 2025 were included. The emphasis was on sustained strength, not fleeting hiring bursts.The 2026 rankings tell a larger story about ambition in India. The highest rewards are flowing to those who heal, those who build, and those who lead. Technical skills remain valuable, but they are part of a wider mosaic.In clinics, construction sites, classrooms, and boardrooms, a quieter transformation is underway. The country’s growth is no longer tethered to a single sector. It is spreading, across industries, across cities, across skill sets.And for millions scanning job portals in search of direction, that shift may be the most reassuring statistic of all.","India’s most promising careers no longer belong overwhelmingly to coders.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

Indian IT Sector Resilient?

Striking a Note of Caution

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Indian IT sector stocks have been bleeding for the last few days, facing a massive selloff on increasing fears that artificial intelligence (AI) tools and models will hit the basic revenue model of the technology sector.The index tracking Indian IT sector stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. has lost a massive $56 billion in market capitalization after Anthropic PBC introduced a tool that some market participants consider a potential challenge to traditional outsourcing business models.But is the situation really so bad for the Indian IT sector? Does the future look bleak, or is the scare around impact of AI overdone?According to a Bloomberg analysis, for investors who remain positive about India’s IT services sector, the recent ‘AI scare trade’ has opened a window to accumulate stocks of companies which are viewed as capable of coming out strong amid pessimistic forecasts about the industry’s future.The brutal selloff in Indian technology stocks has been particularly noticeable across Asia, where the region’s strong hardware manufacturing base continues to be regarded as essential to the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem.The NSE Nifty IT Index has declined by about 15% since the announcement made earlier this month by Anthropic PBC, putting it on course for its steepest monthly fall since March 2020.Although technology stocks in China and Australia with significant software exposure have also come under pressure, the drop has drawn particular attention in India, where IT companies have long been regarded as key drivers of the country’s economic growth narrative.Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. believe the concerns may be exaggerated, noting that Indian IT companies could benefit as more enterprises seek assistance in adopting and embedding AI solutions within their operations. Investors such as PPFAS Mutual Fund also argue that the industry has the flexibility to adjust effectively to evolving technological demands.“Whenever a major technological change occurs, IT firms have historically adapted by upgrading skills and aligning services with client requirements,” Raunak Onkar, research head and fund manager at the $17 billion fund house, which increased its exposure to Indian software companies last month was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.He added that these businesses have consistently succeeded by delivering cost-effective expertise at speed.This constructive outlook reflects expectations among some investors that the recent decline in Indian IT stocks could eventually reverse. Globally, tech stocks have borne the brunt amid concerns about how AI-driven tools might affect companies, especially those whose business models rely on delivering efficiency and productivity improvements for clients.India’s IT outsourcing industry first gained global recognition in the late 1990s when it assisted Western corporations in addressing the Y2K problem, a computer-related risk that threatened widespread disruptions at the turn of the millennium.Since that period, these companies have navigated multiple global economic slowdowns and technological transitions, adapting through phases that included the emergence of mobile communications and the expansion of cloud computing.At present, concerns have emerged that advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could undermine the traditional software services model. However, analysts such as Stephen Bersey of HSBC Holdings Plc argue that such assumptions are misguided and lack logical grounding.In a note dated February 9, Stephen Bersey said that software is important for coordinating interactions between AI-generated outputs and the existing enterprise systems. It is crucial to enable smooth digital operations across AI and non-AI components. He is of the view that Indian IT firms have spent decades developing and delivering enterprise-grade software solutions at scale, and this positions them well in this evolving landscape.Despite this optimism, some observers remain cautious. Critics argue that the efficiency gains delivered by AI could ultimately reduce revenue potential for outsourcing firms. According to Phanisekhar Ponangi, co-founder of Mavenark Asset Managers Pvt., the concerns surrounding AI’s impact on the sector should not be dismissed lightly.He said that for nearly three decades, information technology companies built their success on the promise of delivering higher efficiency for clients. According to him, the sector now faces a significant transition as artificial intelligence shortens project timelines and lowers workforce requirements, with “the client will pocket the productivity gains.”Some market experts, however, believe the industry has already anticipated these changes and is positioning itself accordingly. Companies have increasingly highlighted artificial intelligence initiatives during earnings calls and have begun reporting revenue linked to such offerings. In January, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. stated that its AI-led solutions are generating annualised revenue of about $1.8 billion, with growth of roughly 17 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.Manu Rishi Guptha, a portfolio manager at MRG Capital, said investors may be overlooking two factors that could support Indian IT companies. According to Guptha, strong cash reserves can help firms navigate business model changes triggered by AI. Also, a relatively young workforce is capable of adapting quickly to tech shifts.Guptha added that the recent decline in share prices could represent an opportunity rather than a setback, noting that order inflows have remained steady while valuations have corrected. The Nifty IT index is currently trading at about 20 times forward earnings estimates, marking its lowest valuation level since April 2023.","Indian it sector stocks have been bleeding for the last few days, facing a massive selloff on increasing fears that artificial intelligence (ai) tools and models will hit the basic revenue model of the technology sector.

On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the share was up 3.70% or 50 points to 1,416.The newly announced alliance is designed to build and deliver advanced AI solutions for enterprises operating in telecommunications, financial services, manufacturing and software development, according to ET. The first phase of the partnership will concentrate on the telecommunications industry, where a dedicated Anthropic Center of Excellence will be established to create and deploy AI agents built for sector-specific applications. The companies plan to subsequently extend the collaboration to other sectors, including financial services, manufacturing and software development.Focus of the partnership is integration of Anthropic’s Claude models, including Claude Code, with Infosys Topaz AI offerings. The combined platform is aimed towards help organisations automate complex workflows, accelerate software development cycles and adopt AI systems with the governance, oversight and transparency required in regulated industries.“Together, Infosys and Anthropic aim to help clients reimagine the enterprise operating model by combining deep industry expertise, frontier AI, and engineering scale into one unified approach,” Infosys said in a statement.A major area of emphasis will be agentic AI systems capable of independently executing multi-step tasks such as processing claims, generating and testing code, or conducting compliance reviews. Using tools such as the Claude Agent SDK, the collaboration will support the creation of AI agents that can operate persistently across extended and complex processes rather than handling isolated interactions.Salil Parekh, chief executive officer, Infosys, said, “Our collaboration with Anthropic marks a strategic leap toward advancing enterprise AI, enabling organisations to unlock value and become more intelligent, resilient, and responsible. From modernising financial services with intelligent risk management and compliance, to enabling engineering businesses to lead with AI-driven design and manufacturing, the goal is to leverage the joint expertise of Infosys and Anthropic to accelerate AI value realisation for global enterprises. ”The partnership will also focus on modernising legacy systems.

It took only a 15-second clip of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop at twilight to draw swift outrage, and sizeable fear, from Hollywood over the last few days. The widely circulated video was created by Irish director Ruairi Robinson using Seedance 2.0, a powerful artificial intelligence video generation tool owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance. It had plenty of the bells and whistles of a big-budget Hollywood film: sweeping camera angles, stunt choreography, crisp sound effects and haunting music.With a two-sentence prompt and the click of a button, Seedance had produced a stunningly realistic result that was a drastic improvement over previously generated AI videos, often shoddy clips known as AI slop. This video was so convincing that it drew near immediate condemnation from some of Hollywood's top organisations and companies.Rhett Reese, a scriptwriter known for his ""Deadpool"" films, said that the Cruise-Pitt video had sent a ""cold shiver"" up his spine. ""For all of us who work in the industry and devoted our careers and lives to it, I just think it's nothing short of terrifying,"" he remarked. ""I could just see it costing jobs all over the place.""ByteDance released Seedance 2.0 last week, nearly two months after a previous version had failed to prompt much anger.A news release from the company praised the updated tool's ""physical accuracy, realism and controllability,"" which it said was suitable for the needs of ""professional-grade creative scenarios.""Hollywood was swift to sit up straight. Charles Rivkin, the chair and CEO of the Motion Picture Association, called on ByteDance to ""immediately cease its infringing activity,"" saying in a statement that Seedance 2.0 had engaged in the unauthorised use of copyrighted works on a ""massive scale.""Human Artistry Campaign, a global coalition that advocates using AI ""with respect for the irreplaceable artists, performers and creatives,"" said that unauthorised works generated by Seedance 2.0 violated the ""most basic aspects of personal autonomy.""Disney, which in a watershed $1 billion deal last year agreed to allow OpenAI's Sora users to generate video content with its characters, sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing it of supplying Seedance with a ""pirated library"" of Disney's characters - ""as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public-domain clip art.""ByteDance said it was aware of the concerns about Seedance. ""We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users,"" it said.Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director of Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, said its contracts had specific and enforceable rules about digital replication.

People dressed in traditional Indian attire can be seen playing dhol and tasha drums in what appears to be a shopping centre car park.The caption reads: “Dallas is being transformed into ‘Dallaspuram’ before our eyes.”It adds and blames the visa system for such an environment: “H1B visas are being used to import Indians for basic jobs Texans can do. These guys aren’t top global talent, it’s industrial fraud destroying our great state. Time to put Texans first and end the H1B program!”However, the video is not recent. The clip dates back to August 2025 and was filmed during Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations outside India Bazaar in Lewisville, a northern suburb of Dallas with a large Indian community. The footage first went viral last year.Hindu Americans described it as a joyful annual cultural celebration but the MAGA base complained it caused disruption and ruckus in a commercial parking area.The same video had been repurposed in online debate about immigration and the H1B visa programme which is under high scrutiny right now.Far right commentator and anti-H1B speaker Andrew Branca also reposted the video and said: ""W**, America.

Uber deal and aftermath: Adding fuel to the fire



Türkiye’s Getir vs Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala: $700M Fight Erupts After Uber Steps In

What happens next?







In a major escalation of the ongoing dispute between a once-high-flying delivery start-up and its largest investor , the co-founders of Turkish food and grocery delivery startup Getir, Nazım Salur and Serkan Borançılı, have filed a $700 million lawsuit against Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company, alleging that the sovereign wealth fund breached a 2024 restructuring agreement by withholding key assets they were promised. The claim, lodged in London’s High Court, marks a dramatic escalation in what has become one of the delivery sector’s most closely watched legal disputes.This legal action comes just days after Mubadala agreed to sell Getir’s core food delivery business in Türkiye to Uber Technologies for about $335 million, underscoring how intensely the relationship has deteriorated between the Turkish firm’s founders and its Emirati backer.The lawsuit centres on a June 2024 restructuring deal, under which Mubadala, which had taken majority control of Getir’s Turkish operations, agreed to transfer a specific bundle of assets to the founders as part of the company’s reorganisation. These included international units and, critically, Getir Finance, a technology-driven finance platform valued at around $510 million last year.However, Salur and Borançılı argue that only the least profitable elements, such as FreshDirect (a grocery delivery business based in New York) and n11 (an online commerce platform), were ever handed over to them, while valuable and strategic assets like Getir Finance were never transferred as promised.The lawsuit claims that Mubadala and its associated entities conspired to breach the terms, leaving the founders with significantly diminished control and value.Lawyers for the founders have said that the original agreement envisioned a clean separation and control over the profitable technology and international arms of Getir but that the final offer presented in December 2024 “deviated considerably” from those terms and was highly disadvantageous for Salur and Borançılı. Mubadala has not yet filed a defence in the case.Understanding this legal clash requires some context about Getir’s meteoric rise and recent challenges. Founded in Istanbul in 2015, Getir became one of the earliest players in the quick commerce delivery arena, offering ultra-fast grocery and food deliveries via on-demand app order fulfilment and its valuation soared to nearly $12 billion in 2022.However, like many pandemic-era innovators, the company faced a downturn once demand normalised and investors cooled off on high-growth tech valuations. It subsequently scaled back operations outside Türkiye and Europe and restructured with Mubadala’s backing, culminating in a major organisational split that was supposed to reset its business for long-term sustainability.In recent months, Getir has been the subject of several major investor moves, including the sale of its Turkish delivery business to Uber, a deal that further underscored Mubadala’s shift in strategy and arguably heightened the founders’ dissatisfaction with how the overall plan was unfolding.The $700 million lawsuit is significant for several reasons:The legal timing is crucial. Just last week, Uber confirmed a deal to acquire Getir’s food delivery operations in Türkiye from Mubadala for roughly $335 million, a move that not only consolidates Uber’s presence in a key market but also leaves open questions about how remaining parts of Getir will be managed and monetised.That sale has seemingly intensified the founders’ frustration with Mubadala’s stewardship, with Salur and Borançılı arguing that the restructuring deal’s spirit was not honoured, especially as strategic parts of the business changed hands. Their decision to litigate this now signals they believe they have a strong case and significant leverage, even as their company’s valuation and operational footprint have shrunk from its pandemic highs.The case, being heard in London’s High Court, will unfold over months, and possibly years, as legal teams from both sides present evidence about contractual obligations, alleged breaches and the precise nature of the asset transfers. Mubadala’s response, which has not yet been filed, will be critical in shaping the next chapter. Investors, entrepreneurs and analysts will watch closely, as the outcome could influence how future startups negotiate restructuring deals with deep-pocketed strategic investors, particularly sovereign wealth funds whose incentives sometimes diverge from founders’ visions.Founders Nazım Salur and Serkan Borançılı have sued Mubadala Investment Company for at least $700 million, claiming promised assets were withheld during a 2024 restructuring. The dispute centres on alleged breaches of a restructuring agreement involving valuable units like Getir Finance, while only less profitable entities were transferred. The lawsuit follows Uber’s acquisition of Getir’s Turkish delivery operations for about $335 million, a move that has intensified tensions. The legal battle highlights deep issues between startup founders and large strategic investors, with implications for future break-up and restructuring deals in the global tech industry.","Türkiye’s getir demands $700m from abu dhabi investor mubadala in bitter breakup.
