PM’s Idea Made ISS Mission Possible, Says ISRO Chairman on Gaganyatri Success

BENGALURU: Isro Sunday moved the LVM-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the CMS-03 or Gsat-7R satellite meant for the Indian Navy , to the launchpad in Sriharikota.The satellite, which was initially expected to be launched in late 2024 was delayed. Utilising multiple bands to transmit voice, video and data between naval ships, submarines and aircraft, the satellite is expected to boost India’s maritime defence capabilities.In its fifth operational flight, the rocket will lift off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) carrying the 4,400kg satellite, making it the heaviest communication satellite to be launched to the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) from Indian soil.“CMS-03 is a multi-band communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region including the Indian landmass. The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, which eventually saw India become the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said.With the LVM-3 on the launchpad, Isro has commenced pre-launch operations for the mission, whose launch was being watched closed in the last couple of days owing to predictions of a cyclone.“The direction of the cyclone has changed and we are now good to go for a Nov 2 launch,” a source said. TOI had reported last week that Isro was looking at a Nov 2 second launch.Following the launch of CMS-03, Isro will carry out another LVM-3 mission which will launch US private communication satellite Bluebird. “We are looking at the first week of Dec,” Narayanan had told TOI in a separate interview.","Isro sunday moved the lvm-3 launch vehicle slated to launch the cms-03 or gsat-7r satellite meant for the indian navy.

Building a powerhouse design and hospitality presence in Edmonton

Fashion brand growth and community contributions show her long-term roots

While the hockey world reflected on the Edmonton Oilers’ heartbreaking loss in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final, Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle McDavid, was already pushing forward with her own chase for glory. Months later, her expanding business empire remains one of Edmonton’s most exciting lifestyle stories.Lauren Kyle unveiled her innovative concept Trove Living earlier this year, combining a modern furniture showroom, her interior design offices under Kyle & Co, and a cozy social hub called Bar Trove. The project beautifully reimagines the historic Canada Permanent building downtown, turning more than 9,000 square feet into a one-stop destination for design lovers, professionals, and community gatherings.“I’ve always wanted to have a brick and mortar,” she explained when Trove opened. For years, her designs existed mostly behind the curtain, reserved for clients and friends. Trove changed that. Kyle wanted “the general public to experience something that I created,” and the vision now breathes daily in Edmonton’s core.Her passion for hosting helped shape the concept. From curated décor shopping to grabbing lunch after a meeting, Trove is built around making people feel welcome.“I love hosting. I love making people feel good. I love cooking,” she said.Even as speculation about McDavid’s next contract swirled during the summer, Lauren’s deepening ties to Edmonton hinted strongly at a couple committed to the city. Her fashion label, Sports Club Atelier, continues to grow with elevated sportswear designs and major collaborations on the way.She also plays a hands-on role with the Edmonton Oilers Community Foundation, working alongside other players’ families to support youth and underserved groups.Her entrepreneurial fire hasn’t slowed since the couple’s dreamy 2024 wedding. If anything, she mirrors the competitive energy that drives Edmonton’s captain. As Kyle put it, “We both have dreams that we’re chasing.” For a city that thrives on ambition, her journey feels like a perfect match.Also Read: Sidney Crosby gets candid about chasing Wayne Gretzky and Jaromír Jágr while focusing on legacy over records","Lauren kyle mcdavid is building a powerhouse design and hospitality presence in edmonton.

A reminder that even apart, they remain aligned in what they believe



Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen may have finalized their divorce back in 2022, but their lives continue to mirror each other in ways that keep fans buzzing. This week, all eyes turned toward a pair of social media posts that had the internet wondering if the legendary quarterback was subtly responding to his ex-wife.Gisele Bündchen, now 45, has been embracing a new chapter of life. She and her partner Joaquim Valente recently welcomed a baby together, though the Brazilian supermodel keeps her personal world mostly private. That made her newest Instagram update all the more surprising. In the video, she is seen dancing, surfing, stretching, and training with Valente, while the words “If there's one thing I'd recommend to everyone, it's move your body!” appear on screen.She expanded further in her caption, writing “Movement is medicine. For your heart, your muscles, and just as importantly, for your mind and soul,” encouraging fans to treat physical activity as a gift rather than a task. It was an uplifting, beautifully shot reminder of how healing life can be when you fully embrace the present.Not long after Gisele’s upbeat share, Brady dropped a message in his Instagram stories that immediately grabbed attention.He posted an image encouraging followers to push past procrastination and to choose health-driven habits. The retired quarterback added two raised-hands emojis and a “100” emoji for emphasis.Was this coordinated? Coincidental? A quiet acknowledgment of shared values? It’s impossible to say for sure, but fans wasted no time drawing the connection.Their marriage is over, but Brady and Bündchen still share three children, years of history, and a deep passion for personal wellness. Despite different romantic chapters unfolding for each of them, both continue to inspire millions through fitness, discipline, and positivity.Whether Brady was responding directly or simply living his TB12 brand, one thing feels clear: divorce didn’t erase every bond.

Her ventures in fitness and co-ownership of the Kansas City Current, now valued at $275 million, highlight her entrepreneurial spirit and growing influence in sports and business. Her success is poised for further expansion.

Brittany Mahomes net worth in 2025

Income sources and future growth potential

Brittany Mahomes has stepped firmly into the spotlight, building a thriving identity far beyond the NFL sidelines. As Patrick Mahomes’ wife, she embraces the attention, but her growing influence in sports, fitness, and business proves she’s charting her own path. With confidence, hustle, and bold vision, she’s redefining what a modern sports power couple looks like.In 2025, Brittany Mahomes stands out not just as the partner of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, but as a force in her own right with an estimated net worth of around $15 million, according to Marca.Brittany’ rise began on the soccer pitch, playing at the Kansas City Current-partnered level and at university. That athletic foundation informed her transition into entrepreneurship, including her fitness brand Brittany Lynne Fitness, and being co-owner of the Kansas City Current. Her involvement in the NWSL team is especially noteworthy: the franchise’s valuation jumped to an impressive $275 million in 2025, up 266 % from the prior year.These ventures show how Brittany diversified beyond the “wife of an NFL star” label into someone who strategizes her own brand, investments, and influence. For example, as she told media, “As an athlete myself… there’s been a bunch of passion, talent, and grit that exists in women’s sports.Being able to spotlight this… has just been a dream come true.”Brittany’ net worth comes from multiple channels: co-ownership in the NWSL team, her fitness enterprise, influencer and brand partnerships, plus her role as a high-profile figure in sports and lifestyle. Her influencer earnings add another dimension: one estimate records her Instagram income potential at roughly $27,000-$44,000 per month in 2025 from social media content alone.The growth trajectory suggests she is just getting started. With the Kansas City Current’s soaring valuation, her fitness brand scaling up, and the power couple’s broader business portfolio, Brittany is positioned for continued wealth accumulation. The coming years will likely bring expanded brand collaborations, deeper investment in women’s sports, and higher returns on her media presence.In short: Brittany Mahomes has moved well past the WAG stereotype. In 2025 she’s a co-owner, entrepreneur, influencer, and powerhouse and her $15 million net worth is just the beginning.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns heads in statement outfit showcasing Patrick Mahomes’ face all over","Brittany mahomes is forging her own path, exceeding the 'nfl wife' label with a $15 million net worth by 2025.

Puka Nacua vs Arch Manning: Recent updates and future outlook

“best bargain in the NFL,”

Two young football stars are drawing big attention in 2025 for their earnings and potential. Puka Nacua is making his mark in the NFL with the Los Angeles Rams. Meanwhile, Arch Manning is leading the charge in college football at the Texas Longhorns. Their money stories could not be more different. Here’s a clear, simple look at what each is earning and how their careers are unfolding.Puka Nacua’s base salary in 2025 is $1,030,000. He signed a four-year deal in 2023 worth about $4,084,980. That contract came with a signing bonus of around $244,980, and guaranteed money of the same amount.Analysts say that while his salary is modest now, his performance so far could trigger a much larger extension soon.Arch Manning, playing college football at Texas, has not signed an NFL contract yet. Instead, his earnings come from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. His NIL valuation in 2025 is estimated at $6.8 million, making him the highest-valued college athlete in the United States.He has deals with big brands like Red Bull and Panini America and more. While he is expected to start for Texas in 2025, his income is coming from these endorsements rather than a professional salary.In 2025, Arch Manning clearly earns more than Puka Nacua, $6.8 million versus roughly $1.03 million. But the nature of their earnings is different.Puka Nacua’s salary is for playing in the NFL, a guaranteed contract, while Manning’s money is coming from endorsements and NIL, and not a professional salary. Over time, if Nacua gets the big extension analysts expect, he could close or even reverse the gap.Recently, Puka Nacua has been described as thegiven his low salary compared to impact.For Arch Manning, there has been discussion of him stepping into the starting quarterback role at Texas and dealing with huge expectations.In short, Arch Manning leads now in earnings, and Puka Nacua holds a strong foundation for a major payday ahead.","Puka nacua is making his mark in the nfl with the los angeles rams.

That’s your superpower.

Your unfair advantage.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created. Altman used a thought experiment about a farmer from half a century ago to explain the situation. He said that a farmerAltman suggested that this perspective makes him feelabout the job losses.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read full Letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

“Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift. More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.

Across the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.

Striking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.

Financially, it was a year of record performance. Revenue was $281.7 billion, up 15 percent. Operating income grew 17 percent to $128.5 billion. And Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time, up 34 percent. These results reflect the growing demand for our platform and the trust customers are placing in us. We take neither for granted.

We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Imagine a world where every person can get help from a researcher, a coder, or an analyst on demand. Not just information, but deep, contextual expertise paired with action. Or where every organization, no matter its size or sector, can reinvent employee experiences, reimagine customer engagement, reshape business processes, and bend the curve on innovation for their people, businesses, and industries. This is the new frontier and how we will unlock the next level of productivity and growth for the world.

But it is not some far off vision—we are already seeing what's possible when AI reaches the frontlines of human potential, helping small businesses become more productive, multinationals more competitive, nonprofits more effective, governments more efficient, and improving healthcare and education outcomes.

To share just a few examples across industries: Mercy, one of the largest health systems in the US, has saved caregivers over 100,000 hours by automatically documenting physician-patient encounters. As one physician put it: ""the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" A grandmother in Japan, who lost her hearing at age two, can now communicate with her voice, thanks to an AI app. A judge in Colombia is using Copilot to expedite due process and help tackle a backlog of court cases. Barclays Bank is putting AI in the hands of 100,000 employees, transforming the employee experience by simplifying how they access information and get things done. Ralph Lauren is helping customers find the perfect look for any occasion, thanks to a new conversational shopping experience. Carvana has reduced inbound calls per sale by 45 percent, freeing its staff to focus on complex, high-value support.

These examples, and so many others like them, are made possible by our clear focus on our priorities, our responsibility, and our culture.

OUR PRIORITIES

To deliver on our mission, we remain focused on three core business priorities as our North Star: security, quality, and AI innovation.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world. This year, we made significant progress across both our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI), but we recognize our work here is never done. We must continuously raise the bar for ourselves and our customers.

Security

Through SFI, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to our highest-priority security work. We strengthened identity protections, secured our networks and systems, enhanced threat detection and response, and embedded security-by-design practices across everything we build.

Quality

With QEI, we created frameworks that increase accountability and accelerate progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. This includes improvements to change management, incident management, platform resiliency, and service health.

Together, these initiatives are laying the foundation for a renaissance of our engineering culture, where we build planet-scale systems that power the world, with the security and quality they require.

AI innovation

At the same time, we have made major advances in AI innovation, including across two foundational areas: our Cloud and AI infrastructure, and our family of Copilots and agents.

Our Cloud and AI infrastructure

We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave. We opened new datacenters across six continents and now operate more than 400 datacenters in 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. This year alone, we added over two gigawatts of new capacity. Every Azure region is now AI-first and can support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And just last month, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in southeastern Wisconsin, which will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today.

We are also driving and benefiting from compounding improvements in silicon, systems, and models to improve performance and efficiency. And we continue to invest in sovereign cloud offerings to meet the unique data residency needs of governments and industries worldwide.

We have made meaningful progress on the next frontier in cloud systems: quantum. We announced Majorana-1, the first quantum chip with a topological core, and announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.

In data and analytics, Microsoft Fabric is becoming the unified platform for the AI era. It is now our fastest-growing analytics product ever, with 25,000 paid customers. OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including Power BI semantic models, making it the best foundation for building enterprise AI applications.

We also introduced Azure AI Foundry, a platform to design, customize, and run powerful AI apps and agents. Foundry includes access to more than 11,000 models from partners like OpenAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and others, ensuring our customers can choose from the best frontier and open models in one place. Already, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 use Foundry for their AI workloads.

And this fall we introduced our first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, a super-efficient natural voice generation model that can generate a minute of audio in less than a second on a single GPU, as well as MAI-1 preview, our first foundation model trained end-to-end in-house.

Copilots and agents

Our Copilot family of products is helping people thrive at home, at school, and at work. This year, we surpassed 100 million monthly active users across both commercial and consumer.

We rolled out a major update to Microsoft 365 Copilot this spring, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, and role-specific agents like Analyst and Researcher into a single experience. And earlier this month, we announced Agent Mode, which allows you to start with a simple prompt and then work iteratively with Copilot—steering it as it orchestrates multistep tasks to deliver high-quality Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Give Copilot a prompt like, ""Run a full analysis on this sales data set. I want to understand some important insights to help me make decisions about my business. Make it visual."" Agent Mode gets to work deciding which formulas to use, producing new sheets, and creating data visualizations. It's pretty remarkable.

Copilot Studio continues to grow as well, with more than 230,000 organizations using it to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot or to build their own agents using no-code/low-code tools.

In software development, GitHub Copilot now has more than 20 million users and has evolved into a peer programmer, capable of executing tasks on our behalf asynchronously. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is being used to document millions of clinical encounters, saving precious time that healthcare providers can spend on patients, not paperwork. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce AI agents that help defenders autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks.

On the consumer front, Copilot is now integrated across Bing, Edge, GroupMe, MSN,

Windows

. We also refreshed our Copilot consumer app this year as a more natural, conversational, and personal AI companion. One highlight is Copilot Mode in Edge, which lets you chat directly with your open tabs.

More broadly, we continue to expand our reach with consumers. LinkedIn is now home to 1.2 billion members, and we are bringing AI agents into the core workflows of sales, hiring, and learning. And across gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

At Microsoft, we have always believed that we do well when the world around us does well. We demonstrate this, year after year, by making progress on our commitments to create technology that benefits everyone on the planet, along with the planet itself.

This means that as we drive the AI economy, we are also providing the skills and opportunities for everyone to participate in it. That's why we launched Microsoft Elevate this year, an initiative that unites our technology, skills, research, and philanthropic investments, so AI can benefit every classroom, community, and cause. Over the next five years, we will invest $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofit organizations. And we will partner with organizations like UNICEF, Code.org, and more to extend AI skilling opportunities to people around the globe.

Our skilling initiatives will help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years, from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. And to support our work with deeper research and policy insights, our new AI Economy Institute will explore how AI is reshaping education and work, helping us bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

We are also focused on empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools, making Microsoft 365 Copilot Personal free for 12 months for every college student in the United States. And we're introducing new LinkedIn courses for teachers and students, enabling them to earn LinkedIn certifications that will help boost their resumes and open doors.

Across all of this, one thing is clear: People want technology they can trust. That's why we are committed to driving responsible AI innovation and building safe and secure technology. As we do, we are guided by our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. They are built into the design of our software and services, the security of our data, our privacy protections, and our engagement with employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and governments around the world.

As a multinational company, we remain dedicated to creating jobs, promoting economic opportunities, and strengthening cybersecurity, digital stability, sovereignty, and resilience globally. In Europe, we announced five commitments to strengthen digital stability this year. They start with an expansion of our cloud and AI infrastructure, so every country can compete in the global economy. And they include a promise to uphold Europe's digital resilience regardless of geopolitical and trade volatility.

Responsible business practices are embedded across our operations and supply chain. Following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we've strengthened our due diligence processes, expanded stakeholder engagement, and launched new governance mechanisms to ensure accountability. Our second annual Responsible AI Transparency Report highlighted our work to build and deploy AI responsibly. This includes developing new AI tools and resources to help our customers innovate within evolving regulatory requirements.

Another key component of earning trust is contributing to a safer online ecosystem, including protecting those who use our services from illegal and harmful content and conduct. We continue to take new steps to advance safety, especially for children, while balancing our commitments to free expression and privacy. Over the past year, we've focused on addressing risks related to abusive AI-generated content and partnered with StopNCII.org to detect victim-reported imagery in Bing.

Our solutions, partnerships, and programs reach people and organizations of all abilities to help them thrive. More than 5 million people have participated in our AI Skilling programs focused on accessibility. We launched new technology to help people with disabilities play, work, and live—through an Adaptive Joystick for Xbox, sign language detection in Teams, low-vision keyboards for Surface, and AI-powered visual descriptions in Windows.

2025 also marked the midpoint in our journey to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company, and to protect more land than we use. We are on track to meet many of our targets and continue to accelerate progress for others.

Our renewable energy procurement increased from 1.8 GW in 2020 to 34 GW in 2024, and we contracted nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal—playing a pivotal role in scaling the carbon removal market. We provided more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation and plan to replenish more than 100 million cubic meters of water around the world. We are getting closer to zero waste through new Circular Centers, which contribute to the reuse and recycling of nearly 91 percent of servers and components decommissioned from our datacenters. And we've reached nearly 95 percent recyclability in our product packaging.

We are learning how to make AI more sustainable by design and improve AI-powered solutions. Platforms like our Planetary Computer and our AI for Good Lab are helping us find new ways to address the world's most pressing challenges.

Making progress on these commitments takes time. But here, too—we are guided by a bold vision, thinking in decades and executing in quarters.

OUR CULTURE

Amid this rapid progress, our culture is more important than ever. The AI platform shift is reshaping not just our products and business models, but how we work.

Our growth mindset is essential to our ability to continue leading this AI era. It enables us to innovate both within Microsoft and with those we serve. We must be learn-it-alls, willing to experiment, guided by evaluations, and committed to continuous improvement. I am continually impressed by how our people do just that.

We are focused on being Customer Zero, applying AI to reduce toil and improve flow in our own work while creating a playbook we can share with the world.

We're also embracing a new way of working—one that expands job scopes, reduces handoffs, and gives teams tools to scale productivity in nonlinear ways. This isn't just about driving efficiency. It's about empowering our people to dream bigger and get to ""job complete"" faster, with less friction and greater impact than ever before.

Our employees also continue to find ways to bring their purpose and passion to the causes and communities they care deeply about. This year, they volunteered over 1.2 million hours and gave $263 million (including company match) to 37,000 nonprofit organizations in 110 countries.

In July, after we reported our earnings results—including surpassing $75 billion in annual Azure revenue for the first time—I shared a reflection with all employees. Fifteen years ago, when we set out on our cloud journey, we had a bold vision, and we persisted through all the ups and downs.

I asked our team: What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, ""we got it right""? Hundreds of answers poured in spanning near-term priorities and long-term ambitions alike:

""Helping the world be safe from cybercrime"" ""Speech is now a standard human-machine interface"" ""Using AI to improve the lived experience for people with disabilities"" ""We changed the way people learn"" ""Access to millions of agents powered by orders of magnitude larger models"" ""Medical knowledge has become ambient, embedded in clinical workflows""

""We helped billions become skilled in AI""

These responses and so many others reflected a deep sense of purpose and belief in what's possible. And that is precisely what is needed for us to succeed. Microsoft has an immense opportunity and responsibility—not just in building these futures, but in helping shape the world's future. And I'm confident that together, we can continue to think in decades and execute in quarters on this journey to empower us all.

Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Liberal arts graduates find new tech opportunities

From STEM-focused to problem-finding roles, Cognizant’s approach to hiring graduates









Cognizant is ramping up entry-level hiring as artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, with CEO Ravi Kumar S telling Fortune the company is bringing on more school graduates this year than ever before—and he's looking beyond traditional tech majors to liberal arts colleges and community colleges.Kumar's unconventional hiring strategy stems from his belief that AI will widen the base of corporate employment rather than shrink it. ""I can take a school graduate and give them the tooling so they can actually punch above their weight,"" he told Fortune. ""AI is an amplifier of human potential. It's not a displacement strategy.""The CEO of the 350,000-employee IT consulting firm is actively recruiting non-STEM graduates, including anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and journalists. His rationale: as expertise becomes accessible at everyone's fingertips through AI, specialisation loses its premium. ""Intelligence is not the asymmetry. Applying intelligence is the asymmetry,"" Kumar explained.He urged students to ""start to focus on interdisciplinary skills,"" citing examples like historians blending computational skills to become futurists or biology majors using AI to crack drug development cycles.According to Kumar, the corporate pyramid is becoming ""broader and shorter,"" with faster paths to expertise for those who can leverage AI tools effectively.Kumar sees AI handling the ""middle"" work—the execution and problem-solving—while humans focus on the beginning (prompting, conceptualising, finding purposeful problems) and the end (validation and verification). This shift means companies need more ""problem finders"" rather than just problem solvers, opening doors for disciplines traditionally outside tech's core.The shift extends beyond hiring. Cognizant has launched apprenticeship programs in 30 states and partnered with Merit America for mid-career shifts, offering a ""work, earn and learn"" model. Kumar acknowledges a critical caveat: AI's benefits must be ""distributed equitably"" rather than concentrated among a few to truly boost productivity and create wage distribution.""As people are living longer, the life of their skills is getting shorter,"" Kumar noted, emphasising that future workers will need multiple careers in one lifetime—making adaptable, interdisciplinary skills more valuable than narrow expertise.","Cognizant is hiring more school graduates this year than ever before.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","X witnessing executive exodus amid strategic churn.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Brian Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.",Airbnb ceo brian chesky expressed interest in integrating openai’s chatgpt into the travel platform.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

The Bermuda Triangle of Talent

Investigating the insecure overachiever





Simon van Teutem is a 27-year-old Dutch author, journalist, and Oxford graduate who has become a prominent voice in the global debate over how and why Gen Z talent ends up in elite corporate jobs that often feel unfulfilling. Instead of accepting lucrative offers from McKinsey and Morgan Stanley after graduation, he chose a different path: investigating the psychological, social and economic forces that steer the smartest students into a narrow set of careers.Van Teutem studied politics and economics at Oxford University, where he saw his peers funnelled into consulting, investment banking and corporate law. What troubled him most was not the prestige of these paths but how inevitable they felt. In interviews, he has said that most students believed they had limitless choices but still selected from the same small handful of firms. After internships at BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and McKinsey, he realised that he too had become part of this pattern and decided to step away before it consumed his future ambitions.His book, The Bermuda Triangle of Talent (2025), explores what he calls the gravitational pull of prestige.Drawing on more than 200 interviews with graduates, recruiters and behavioural economists, he argues that young, highly educated professionals are taught to chase status, safety and constant advancement. Many plan to spend only a couple of years in high-pressure roles before switching to something more meaningful but rarely escape. As salaries rise and lifestyles expand, leaving becomes harder, and work that once seemed temporary becomes the entire career.Van Teutem’s key concept is the insecure overachiever, a person conditioned to measure success by continual validation. He says elite firms understand that mindset better than anyone, offering sophisticated but ultimately shallow challenges. He is not anti-corporate. Rather, his work highlights the opportunity cost when some of the world’s brightest minds spend decades producing slide decks or restructuring deals instead of solving public problems.Alongside journalism at the Dutch platform De Correspondent, van Teutem is pursuing a doctorate in politics at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. His early experience inside major financial and consulting firms provides the firsthand insight that underpins his critique. His aim is to reveal the invisible forces behind career choices, not to shame anyone who makes them.","Simon van teutem studied politics and economics at oxford university.

The Bottom Line





When Prime Minister Keir Starmer stood before cameras on 26 September 2025 to unveil Britain’s first national digital ID, he called it a “modern solution for a modern country.”The BritCard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy — applying for jobs, renting homes, opening bank accounts.Within hours, it had done something else entirely: trigger a nationwide debate about surveillance, data rights and state overreach in a country that famously scrapped its last ID card plan fifteen years ago.The BritCard Digital ID is designed to serve as a single digital credential for identity verification.It builds on the GOV.UK One Login programme and will be free for all citizens and residents with the right to live and work in the UK.Starmer argued the system would reduce paperwork and save up to £85 in private verification fees. But the plan’s link to employment verification — BritCard will be required for all new jobs and housing rentals — has blurred the line between voluntary and mandatory use.Polls now show public support slipping to -14%, with over 1.4 million online engagements dominated by scepticism.The digital ID’s rollout follows Labour’s broader attempt to modernise governance and tighten control over illegal migration.Officials claim BritCard will cut fraud, speed up background checks and create a secure, encrypted system without a centralised database.However, the scheme’s announcement was met with social media backlash.Community notes on X (formerly Twitter) challenged Starmer’s claims on verification costs, while privacy campaigners accused the government of “rebranding the old ID card under a digital label.”The BritCard revives one of Britain’s most divisive policy ideas — national identity verification — in a new digital form.The UK’s last attempt, under Tony Blair in the 2000s, was scrapped in 2010 after concerns about surveillance and cost overruns.Critics say the BritCard risks repeating that history.They warn of function creep, where a voluntary system quietly becomes required for access to essential services, echoing fears around China’s social credit model or India’s Aadhaar before reforms introduced stronger privacy rules.Civil liberty groups like Big Brother Watch warn BritCard could create a “checkpoint society,” allowing the state to track everyday activities.Cybersecurity experts say connecting multiple databases under one digital identity increases the risk of breaches and identity theft.People without smartphones or reliable internet could face new barriers in employment and housing.Opposition MPs, including former minister David Davis, argue that “voluntary today” could become “compulsory tomorrow,” especially once integrated with other services.Downing Street insists BritCard is secure, optional, and citizen-centred.Officials emphasise there will be no single national database and that the system will rely on encrypted credentials stored by users.The government claims the project will “restore trust in identity,” streamline background checks, and support law enforcement in tackling illegal working and benefit fraud.A Home Office spokesperson said the plan will “make life simpler for the law-abiding majority and harder for those exploiting the system.”Public sentiment remains sharply divided.On X, hashtags like #NoToBritCard and #StopDigitalID trended within hours of the launch.Civil rights groups have filed petitions urging Parliament to halt the rollout, warning it would “normalise constant verification.”Polling by Ipsos shows 57% of Britons back ID cards in theory, but only 38% support a purely digital version.Critics argue that the scheme’s success depends less on technology and more on trust, something successive British governments have struggled to maintain after multiple data scandals.The government plans a phased rollout starting with veterans and select public sector workers in 2026, before expanding nationwide.BritCard credentials could eventually integrate with driving licences, NHS records and tax accounts under the planned GOV.UK Wallet.The Home Affairs Committee has opened an inquiry into the proposal’s privacy, cybersecurity and equality implications.Its findings will likely shape how far and how fast the system proceeds.For Starmer, BritCard represents efficiency, innovation and control.For opponents, it symbolises state overreach dressed up as digital progress.The next year will test whether Britain’s digital identity revolution can convince citizens that convenience does not have to come at the cost of freedom.","The britcard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy.

Rare Video Of Louvre Heist: Watch Thieves Flee Calmly After Robbing France's €88 Mn Royal Treasure

When something needs to be done quickly

From shock to social media glory

The poetry of efficiency

Cultural burglary at its finest





There’s something absurdly European about a crime where the French lose their jewels and the Germans gain a marketing slogan.Last Sunday, thieves carried out a four-minute daylight heist at the Louvre, the kind of operation that would’ve made Danny Ocean blush. They rolled up in a truck, deployed a German-made Böcker Agilo freight lift, scaled the museum’s façade, smashed their way into a gallery, and disappeared on motorbikes through the Parisian maze.The French police are still looking for suspects. The internet, however, has already found its protagonist — the lift.The Agilo, built by the family-owned firm Böcker Maschinenwerke GmbH in North Rhine-Westphalia, wasn’t designed for criminal brilliance. It’s meant for construction sites and furniture removal — the kind of lift you hire when you’re moving apartments, not stealing history.But once photos of the Böcker machine parked outside the Louvre went viral, the company did what any self-respecting German manufacturer would do: turned mortification into marketing. By Monday, they had posted a picture of the lift online with the caption, “When something needs to be done quickly,” cheekily touting its ability to carry 400 kilograms of “treasures” at 42 metres per minute.The internet lapped it up.It was industrial poetry — the sort that could only come from a nation that treats punctuality as religion and engineering as art.Alexander Böcker, the company’s third-generation managing director, admitted he was initially “shocked” when he saw the images. But, as he told the Associated Press, once the disbelief faded, “black humour took over.”By then, the memes had already begun: clips of the Agilo rising along the Louvre façade cut to the Mission: Impossible theme, fan accounts christening it “The Louvre Express,” and tweets declaring that Germany had finally conquered Paris — one lift at a time.For the French, it was humiliation wrapped in irony. For Böcker, it was the kind of global attention that no ad agency could buy.The contrast could not be sharper. France, home to romance, art, and a lingering nostalgia for empire, undone by a German machine designed to move drywall. A nation of philosophy defeated by a company whose core value is “precision lifting since 1958.”Even Böcker’s marketing post had the politeness of a corporate memo and the punchline of a stand-up comic. It didn’t brag. It didn’t gloat. It simply existed — much like German humour itself: dry, literal, and devastatingly efficient.Of course, Böcker clarified that the Agilo isn’t certified to carry humans. It’s a freight lift. Furniture, yes. Thieves, no. The AP turned that disclaimer into an editorial mic drop.Somewhere in all this, the actual stolen Napoleonic jewels became a subplot. The memes had won. The Germans had turned a French embarrassment into a case study in brand virality. And Böcker Maschinenwerke, once known only to builders and movers, had ascended into pop-culture stardom.For a continent that can’t decide whether it wants to laugh, cry, or nationalise its humour, the Louvre heist became the perfect symbol of modern Europe: the French supply the drama, the Germans supply the tools, and the internet supplies the applause.And just like that, art was stolen, pride was dented, and a freight lift became a legend — proving once again that in Europe, efficiency will always find a way.","The german-made böcker agilo freight lift was used in the louvre heist.

A broader picture: Privacy, regulation, and digital freedom





The United Arab Emirates has emerged as the global leader in virtual private network (VPN) adoption, with more than 6.1 million VPN app downloads recorded in just the first half of 2025.According to data compiled by Cybernews, the UAE has maintained the highest average VPN adoption rate in the world — 65.78% between 2020 and mid-2025, peaking at 83.52% in 2024.In comparison, Qatar ranks second with a 55.43% average adoption rate, followed by Singapore (38.23%), Nauru (35.49%), Oman (31.04%), and Saudi Arabia (28.93%).The report, based on download statistics for the 50 most popular VPN apps from both Google Play and the Apple App Store, analyzed trends across multiple countries by comparing total downloads to national populations to estimate adoption rates.The findings reveal that the Middle East leads globally in VPN penetration. Of the nine countries surveyed in the region, five rank in the global top ten, while eight appear in the top fifty. By contrast, Africa has the lowest rates, with none of its 21 surveyed nations entering the top 50 list and eight of the ten lowest-ranking countries located on the continent.The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, including the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait — account for some of the world’s highest VPN adoption rates.Cybernews’ analysis suggests that this trend stems largely from strict internet regulation policies, content filtering, and state-level monitoring that shape how users access the web.Across the region, governments maintain extensive digital governance frameworks that restrict online material deemed politically sensitive, morally inappropriate, or socially non-compliant.Blocked categories often include:Another major factor driving VPN reliance is the restriction of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, such as WhatsApp calls, Skype, and FaceTime — which are widely used globally but limited in the Gulf.Analysts note that such restrictions support the business models of state-owned telecommunications providers, but they also encourage residents, particularly the UAE’s large expatriate population, to seek VPNs for international communication and entertainment.VPNs are also commonly used to bypass geo-blocks and access international streaming libraries, as well as to maintain online privacy and secure data when using public networks.In the UAE alone, the pattern of heavy VPN usage reflects both rapid population growth and digital behavior trends.The country’s population reached a record 11.44 million in 2025, according to Worldometer, suggesting that the growing number of residents — many of whom are digitally active expatriates, contributes significantly to the high volume of VPN downloads.Between 2020 and 2025, the UAE consistently dominated global VPN download charts, with figures remaining high across multiple years:If the current download pace continues, total figures for 2025 are expected to exceed the previous year’s record.The trend underscores the country’s strong appetite for digital privacy tools, especially as awareness of online surveillance and data tracking grows worldwide.Other Gulf states also report significant volumes:Even with these fluctuations, VPN adoption remains robust across the region, with the UAE continuing to outpace all others.While VPN usage itself is legal in the UAE, its misuse is a serious criminal offence under Federal Decree Law No. (34) of 2021 on Combatting Rumours and Cybercrimes.The law explicitly permits VPNs for legitimate purposes, such as corporate security, remote work, or accessing globally available services, but strictly prohibits using them to hide criminal activity, access blocked sites, or disguise one’s identity.Article 10 of the decree, titledstates:The law also grants authorities the power to block access to specific websites or digital accounts operating within the UAE. This includes content that may compromise national security or sovereignty, affect public order, damage diplomatic relations, or undermine confidence in government institutions.In simpler terms, while UAE residents may install and use VPNs, they must not use these tools to:Violations can lead to imprisonment, hefty financial penalties, or both, depending on the severity of the offence.Globally, VPN use has surged as individuals and businesses prioritize data protection, anonymity, and unrestricted access to online platforms.Cybernews’ data shows that regions with greater censorship and content regulation, particularly the Middle East, exhibit the highest adoption levels.By contrast, Africa remains at the lower end of VPN usage, with none of its 21 analyzed countries appearing in the global top 50.This stark regional divide highlights how state-level internet control policies continue to shape how citizens navigate and secure their digital lives.In the case of the UAE, the balance between digital freedom and cybersecurity enforcement remains a defining feature of its online environment.As millions continue to rely on VPNs for communication, streaming, and privacy, the country’s laws serve as a reminder that technological convenience does not exempt users from legal responsibility.","In the first half of 2025, uae residents downloaded over 6.1 million vpn apps, maintaining the highest global adoption rate.
