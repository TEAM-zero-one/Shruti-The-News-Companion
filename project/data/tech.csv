"Today's youth is no longer just a 'job seeker', but a 'job creator': Delhi CM Rekha Gupta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/todays-youth-is-no-longer-just-a-job-seeker-but-a-job-creator-delhi-cm-rekha-gupta/articleshow/126531700.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship, Jayant Chaudhary, and the chief minister of Delhi, Rekha Gupta, on Wednesday, inaugurated the 'Campus to Market - Delhi Startup Yuva Festival 2026' at the Dr Ambedkar International Centre.The programme is being organised by the Directorate of Training and Technical Education (DTTE) of the Government of Delhi. On this occasion, the Union Minister of State and the Chief Minister interacted with young innovators, teachers, investors and startup founders from universities, colleges and technical institutions, and reviewed the exhibition of student-led innovations.Jayant Chaudhary and Rekha Gupta visited the startup exhibition and observed various innovations, prototypes and business models on display, appreciating the creativity, problem-solving abilities and technological outlook of young entrepreneurs. They held detailed discussions with several student teams on their startup ideas, market strategies, and social impact, and assured them of continued guidance and support to help turn innovations into real-world solutions. Delhi Government Cabinet Minister Ashish Sood and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.Union Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary said that India is a young nation with immense youth power, which gives the country tremendous working capacity.However, the true benefit of this demographic advantage will be realised only when young people are given opportunities to move forward, their talent is recognised, and their skills are refined.He said that earlier, the education system was such that students who did not fit into the traditional academic framework found the doors of schools and colleges almost closed. Even universities focus largely on textbook-based learning.The minister said that the prevailing mindset across the system was that only formal education mattered. However, he said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision and the National Education Policy, this thinking is being transformed.The minister said that today, the focus should be not merely on degrees but on capabilities. This is possible only through skill-based education, experiential learning opportunities and exposure to the real world.Chief minister Rekha Gupta said that today's youth is no longer merely a 'job seeker', but is emerging as a 'job creator'. She noted that student startups in Delhi are demonstrating exceptional creativity and innovation, offering practical solutions to contemporary social, environmental and technological challenges.She said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a strong startup and innovation ecosystem has been developed across the country, providing young people with the platforms, policies and support needed to journey from idea to enterprise.The Delhi CM said her Government is also working rapidly in this direction by integrating education, skills and entrepreneurship to position the capital as the Startup Capital of India. The Chief Minister urged the youth to adopt a solutions-driven mindset for the nation, so that Delhi and India can lead global innovation.Delhi's education minister Ashish Sood said that startups had existed in Delhi earlier, but they were scattered. There was neither a clear startup policy nor a structured mechanism to connect students with industry, mentors and investors. Initiatives related to education and startups were largely limited to announcements. This mindset has now completely changed.The Delhi minister said that the state Government is building an ecosystem from school education to higher and technical education, placing skill development, entrepreneurship and innovation at the core, with public and private institutions working together.He said the Startup Yuva Festival exemplifies this transformation. For the first time, 11 universities, 12 colleges and 19 ITIs have been brought together on a single platform. The 'Campus to Market' approach has now been implemented in a structured manner, providing students with access to mentorship, funding and markets.At present, more than 75,000 students and young people are engaged in entrepreneurship programmes, and over 470 startups are in incubation. These student startups have generated Rs 500-600 crore in revenue, with each startup creating an average of 4-5 jobs.The education minister said that at the school level, under the NEEEV curriculum, 5,000 student teams have been provided assistance of Rs 20,000 per team. In addition, at the Startup Yuva Festival, the top six startups are awarded equity-free grants of Rs 10 lakh each, while the top 100 startups receive Rs 1 lakh each. He further stated that the Delhi Government will soon implement the Delhi Startup Policy, with a provision of Rs 325 crore over the next five years and a target to develop 5,000 startups by 2035.The Startup Yuva Festival 2026 is the Delhi Government's flagship programme, aimed at establishing Delhi as the Startup Capital of India. Organised by the Delhi Government, the festival is a significant initiative to take student-led startups from campus to market. Its objective is to convert innovations developed within educational institutions into commercially viable and sustainable enterprises.Under the 'Campus to Market' initiative, students had the opportunity to present their ideas to investors, mentors, and industry experts. The programme also featured knowledge sessions, policy roundtables and an award ceremony. Out of more than 700 applications, over 60 startups participated in the Startup Expo, of which the top 20 were selected for live pitching. As prizes, the top six startups received Rs 10 lakh each, while the top 100 startups received Rs 1 lakh each.

New York Mets put $50 million per year on the table as Kyle Tucker

New York Mets outfield plans remained thin with Juan Soto

Toronto Blue Jays position a longer contract that lowers Kyle Tucker’s annual value

Kyle Tucker's free agency is at a pivotal stage, and the New York Mets are making it obvious they don't want to fall behind. Initially, it was a quick, high-value proposal, but now it's shifted in a significant way, suggesting that the Mets feel a decision could be on the horizon.Sources close to the situation indicate that the offer's structure has been modified to enhance New York's standing, both financially and strategically. Additionally, ownership has sent a clear message that this pursuit is significant, particularly considering the Mets' current outfield needs. With other teams offering contrasting contract proposals, Tucker now has to make a decision that involves more than just money. The upcoming move could decide if the Mets successfully acquire their target or see him sign with another team.The New York Mets have made a short-term offer to Tucker, valued at an average of $50 million per year. This was confirmed by MLB Network insider Jon Heyman and others. According to Will Sammon from The Athletic, the Mets have conducted several video meetings with Tucker over the last week and proposed a three-year contract worth between $120 million and $140 million.Jim Duquette, who used to be the Mets General Manager and is now an analyst for SNY, mentioned on MLB Network Radio that the Mets have probably added a fourth year to their earlier reported three-year, $150 million agreement with Kyle Tucker.Duquette pointed out that the deal would probably include at least one opt-out. This matches earlier speculation since the Mets preferred to offer a shorter contract, possibly under four years, but it seems they have now changed their approach.The Mets are anticipating a response from Kyle Tucker ""in the near future"" as the free agent weighs his options. This implies that the discussions are progressing, with the fourth-year addition likely trying to enhance the competitiveness of the offer.Mets owner Steve Cohen getting involved shows how serious they are about this chase. Jim Duquette mentioned that Cohen is part of the talks, highlighting the team's dedication to landing Tucker.This comes as the Mets are working on their offseason game plan, having already made some big moves but still needing to strengthen their outfield after sending Brandon Nimmo to the Rangers.Right now, Juan Soto is the only outfielder secured, with Tyrone Taylor and Carson Benge being the leading options for center and left field. Bringing Tucker on board would instantly change the lineup.Cohen's position also aligns with the larger story of the Mets' bold spending since he took over. If Tucker agrees to a $50 million per season contract, Cohen would be on the hook for $101 million just for Tucker and another high-priced player like Soto in 2026.The Mets aren't the only team after Tucker. According to ESPN, the Mets have put a $50 million per season short-term deal on the table for him, but he's also considering offers from the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays' proposal is said to be a long-term deal that pays Tucker less annually compared to New York's offer. While the Mets are leaning towards a shorter contract, the Blue Jays are likely to present a longer one.The Los Angeles Dodgers are definitely in the conversation. They’re still hanging around and can put together a huge short-term contract, but we haven’t seen any exact figures yet. Former MLB executive Jim Duquette mentioned earlier that the Mets, Dodgers, and Blue Jays are the top contenders, with Tucker having met with all three teams, either face-to-face or via Zoom, during the recruitment process.The New York Yankees are currently ""on the outskirts"" of the Tucker situation. This interest comes up as talks with Cody Bellinger have hit a standstill, leading the Yankees to look into other options like Tucker and Bo Bichette.Also Read: MLB trade rumour: Ryan Weathers trade gives New York Yankees immediate pitching help while Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodón recover","The new york mets have made a short-term offer to kyle tucker.

Alex Bregman thanks Boston Red Sox for ‘honor’ of playing there before choosing five-year Chicago Cubs’ $175 million dollar contract,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/alex-bregman-thanks-boston-red-sox-for-honor-of-playing-there-before-choosing-five-year-chicago-cubs-175-million-dollar-contract/articleshow/126536675.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Alex Bregman’s new contract with the Chicago Cubs

Alex Bregman's career background and path to free agency

The Red Sox's efforts to retain Alex Bregman

After signing with the Cubs, Bregman took to Instagram to post a photo along with a touching message expressing his gratitude to the Red Sox organization and the city of Boston. ""It was an honor to play for a city that shares the same passion and love for the game as I do,"" Bregman wrote. ""You welcomed my family with open arms and we will always be grateful for the support you gave us."" This goodbye followed Bregman's one-season stint with the Red Sox, where he had established himself as an important veteran figure in the clubhouse.Bregman signed a five-year contract worth $175 million with the Chicago Cubs on January 10, 2026, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. This deal has an average annual value of $35 million and comes with a complete no-trade clause, without any opt-out options.It includes $70 million in deferrals, bringing the current value down to around $150 million to $155 million, as per sources familiar with the details.The Cubs made the contract announcement on January 14, 2026. This deal ranks as the third-largest in Cubs history by total value, following Jason Heyward's eight-year, $184 million contract from 2015 and Dansby Swanson's seven-year, $177 million agreement from 2022.Bregman, a 31-year-old guy from Albuquerque, New Mexico, kicked off his MLB career with the Houston Astros, playing there for nine seasons from 2016 to 2024. During his time with the Astros, he snagged World Series titles in 2017 and 2022.After wrapping up the 2024 season, he inked a three-year, $120 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, which had opt-out options after the 2025 and 2026 seasons. Bregman decided to opt-out after the 2025 season, jumping into free agency even though he could have made more money annually by sticking with Boston. Ultimately, he went with the Cubs' offer for better long-term stability.In 2025, Bregman took the field for 114 games with the Red Sox, boasting a batting average of .273 along with 18 home runs and 62 RBIs. That year, he made his third All-Star appearance, but he did miss some games due to a quad injury.He was placed on the 10-day injured list starting May 24, 2025, and was activated again on July 11, 2025. His performance included an .822 OPS and strong defensive skills at third base.The Red Sox extended a five-year, $165 million proposal to Bregman, featuring significant deferrals but lacking a no-trade clause, consistent with the team's policy.As reported by ESPN's Buster Olney, the Red Sox thought this offer would guarantee his return, and the organization felt genuine disappointment when he opted for the Cubs. In an email interview with MassLive, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow mentioned that, ""Any time you are active in trying to bring a player in, it's disappointing to lose out.""With Bregman joining the team, the Cubs are looking to capitalize on their success from 2025. As a three-time All-Star and a proven winner, he adds offensive strength and leadership to a squad that has high hopes for the 2026 season.Also Read: New York Mets likely expanded their offer to four years as Steve Cohen became directly involved in Kyle Tucker negotiations","Alex bregman signed a five-year contract worth $175 million with the chicago cubs.

"Budget 2026: Industry flags customs litigation, compliance bottlenecks as key pain points",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-industry-flags-customs-litigation-compliance-bottlenecks-as-key-pain-points/articleshow/126537363.cms,"A key industry demand relates to strengthening the Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (CAAR). (AI image)

Mitigate litigation, strengthen Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR):

Extend AEO benefits to newly incorporated group companies:

Facilitation measures for importers and exporters:

Digitalisation of the customs litigation process:

Operationalise Section 11(3) for true single-window compliance:

Summing up:

As the Centre readies the Union Budget 2026-27, industry and tax experts have flagged mounting customs litigation, uneven trade facilitation and gaps in digitalisation as areas needing urgent policy attention. In its pre-Budget memorandum, FICCI has outlined a series of indirect tax proposals aimed at reducing disputes, improving certainty and aligning customs administration with the government’s ease-of-doing-business agenda.Tax professionals echo these concerns, warning that without structural fixes, litigation and compliance friction could blunt India’s manufacturing and export ambitions.A key industry demand relates to strengthening the Customs Authority for Advance Rulings (CAAR), which has emerged as a crucial tool for trade certainty after its revamp in 2018. FICCI has pointed out that CAAR benches currently operate only from Delhi and Mumbai, even as a significant volume of imports and exports flow through southern and eastern ports such as Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata.The industry body has urged the government to establish additional CAAR offices in the south and east, arguing that wider regional access would reduce litigation and compliance costs for businesses operating far from existing benches.FICCI has also sought a mechanism for extending the validity of advance rulings—currently limited to three years—on a self-declaration basis where there is no change in law or facts, to avoid repetitive filings.Tax experts say the scope of advance rulings itself needs to widen. Mahesh Jaising, Partner at Deloitte India, has noted that non-tariff measures often create uncertainty because their language is not aligned with global nomenclature standards. He has recommended empowering CAAR to rule on the applicability of specific non-tariff measures, on a particular importer/ exporter, after seeking the written opinion of the concerned departmental authority, beginning with agencies already integrated into the single-window customs platform. He has also backed expanding the number of CAAR benches to improve speed and predictability.From a dispute-resolution perspective, Smita Singh, Partner (Indirect Tax) at S&A Law Offices, has flagged prolonged customs litigation as a major business risk. She has suggested a one-time settlement scheme under the Customs Act—on the lines of the Sabka Vishwas scheme—to unlock revenue stuck in disputes and reduce legacy litigation.FICCI has also highlighted structural gaps in the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) framework, particularly for newly incorporated entities within established corporate groups. Under current rules, applicants must typically demonstrate a three-year operational and financial track record. This is a criteria that newly formed subsidiaries or restructured entities are unable to meet, even if their parent group is AEO-certified.The industry body has recommended that new companies within AEO-accredited groups be allowed to apply for certification, subject to standard checks. It has also suggested continuity of AEO status in merger situations involving entities that already enjoy AEO Tier-2 status, through a simple intimation rather than a fresh application.According to Deloitte’s Mahesh Jaising, the AEO programme—now approaching its tenth year needs a broader reset. He has argued that delays and inconsistent interpretations have diluted the scheme’s core objective of trade facilitation.Among the suggestions are strict timelines for processing applications, provisional approvals where delays are attributable to the department, and clearer guidance on how past litigation affects eligibility. He has also called for expanding AEO benefits to exporters, including integration with mutual recognition agreements under free trade agreements.On the operational front, FICCI has drawn attention to fragmented communication in customs administration. At present, trade notices are issued independently by different customs commissionerates, forcing businesses to track multiple websites or make physical visits to customs houses.To address this, FICCI has proposed a centralised, real-time digital repository of all trade notices accessible to importers and exporters nationwide. The industry body believes such a database would improve transparency, ensure uniform assessment practices across ports and reduce avoidable procedural friction.Despite broader government pushes under the Digital India programme, customs adjudication and litigation remain heavily paper-driven. Businesses are still required to file physical replies to show cause notices, appeals and supporting documents, all with manual signatures.Mahesh Jaising of Deloitte has argued that this hybrid system undermines efficiency gains from virtual hearings already permitted under customs law. He has recommended enabling provisions in the Customs Act to allow fully digital filing of appeals, submissions and correspondence, broadly aligned with the GST framework, to ease compliance burdens and speed up dispute resolution.Another recurring pain point for trade is the proliferation of non-tariff regulations issued by multiple ministries and regulators, often without a single, harmonised compliance interface. Section 11(3) of the Customs Act, inserted in 2018, was intended to address this by requiring that import-export restrictions under other laws become operational only when notified under the Customs Act.Experts say this provision remains under-utilised. Jaising has recommended issuing a comprehensive notification under Section 11(3) to route all cross-regulatory obligations through a single customs-linked database. Such a move, he argues, would significantly reduce interpretational disputes for both trade and field officers and move India closer to a genuine single-window customs regime.Custom reform must move beyond rate tweaks to focus on litigation management, certainty, and system-level facilitation. With manufacturing, exports and supply-chain resilience central to India’s growth strategy, stakeholders argue that sharper indirect tax reforms could yield outsized gains in competitiveness and investor confidence.","As the centre readies the union budget 2026-27, industry and tax experts have flagged mounting customs litigation, uneven trade facilitation and gaps in digitalisation as areas needing urgent policy attention.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon musk, tesla, spacex, and x’s ceo, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

2016 to 2019: Foundation years with limited earnings

2020 to 2022: Twitch success reshapes his finances

2023 to 2026: Multimillion-dollar dominance





Kai Cenat had started posting funny skit videos online in the year 2016, even before he considered financial gain as a motive. Specifically, at this point of time, Kai was actually trying out things in the online world and earning either nothing or hardly anything at all. His approximate net worth was actually nearer to zero, and he was just trying to get noticed.However, by the start of 2018, content from Cenat began picking up momentum on all social media platforms. Small advertising payments as well as brand partnerships helped boost his net worth estimated value from being a small amount into the $20,000-$40,000 bracket, which may not seem like a lot, but nonetheless indicated some financial success on his part.Between 2016 and 2019, Kai Cenat began building his fan base with comedic content. During this time, his earnings were minimal, and his net worth did not exceed $50,000. This phase of his career was important in that it prepared him for the massive switch in platforms that would happen in the subsequent periods. At the end of 2019, Cenat had acquired enough fan support to pursue larger opportunities.When Cenat took the plunge into Twitch streaming in 2020, his earnings changed big time.With increasing subscribers and viral moments, incomes started rising steeply.By 2021, his net worth had grown to approximately $1 million, with primary drivers being subscriptions on Twitch, ad revenue, and sponsorships.By late 2022, his expanding audience and growing brand partnerships reportedly boosted his net worth to roughly $2–3 million, cementing his status as a rising star in streaming.From 2023 onward, Kai Cenat entered his most profitable era. Record-breaking subathons, high-profile collaborations, and major brand deals dramatically boosted his earnings.By 2024, his net worth was widely estimated to have crossed $14 million.Estimated industry values/fixtures indicated that his net worth stood around 35 million by 2025-2026, making him one of the highest-paid live-streamers in the world.The net worth of Kai Cenat between 2016 and early 2026 is a result of layered growth and not overnight success. Every stage of his career has added to his net worth, making his content creation efforts into a streaming giant that is now worth several million dollars.Also Read: Nick Fuentes says he wants to take over Kick and asks Adin Ross for help","Kai cenat started posting funny skit videos online in the year 2016, even before he considered financial gain as a motive.

“girl, get up,”





Twitch and Kick streamer Adin Ross is facing heavy backlash after comments he made about rapper Doechii and other Black women sparked outrage online. The 25-year-old streamer reportedly saw his monthly earnings on Kick drop by more than 30%, which has fueled speculation that he may take a temporary break from the platform. While Ross has not officially confirmed quitting, tensions between him and Kick reportedly grew after a reduction in partner payouts following his switch to a new betting sponsor. Fans and critics alike have been discussing the controversy, making it one of the biggest topics in the streaming community.The controversy started after Ross criticized Doechii, calling her anand using offensive language in response to a Met Gala clip showing her scolding staff. He later released a diss track calledwith rapper 6ix9ine, further insulting her, which drew strong reactions from members of the Black community, as well as hip-hop figures like Glasses Malone and Joe Budden. In response, Ross pledged six figures to Black-owned businesses and denied that his comments were racist, but the backlash has continued, affecting both his reputation and his earnings.Ross reportedly claimed that Kick reduced his partner earnings after he joined Rainbet instead of Stake, calling the situationHe also rejected a 2025 Kick deal and announced that he would no longer doon the platform. While he plans to continue streaming on Twitch, including appearances with guests like 6ix9ine, the ongoing friction with Kick and the loss of revenue highlight the financial impact of the controversy.Previous breaks and equity claims in 2024 show that this tension between Ross and the platform is not new.This has already led to Ross losing multi-million-dollar endorsements as well as NBA partnerships despite his efforts to restore his public image. Doechii has, on the other hand, seemingly referenced the conflict in her own trackfeaturing SZA, questioning why successful black women are subject to so much hate. At the moment, Ross is still streaming but seems to be carefully considering his next step in light of the conflict while still being able to sustain his streaming career.Also Read: Kai Cenat net worth timeline (2016 to 2026): Breaking down his rise from early content to streaming dominance","Adin ross may quit kick temporarily after backlash and earnings drop.

Microsoft makes 5 promises to everyone in America: We will ensure your electricity bill does not increase and 4 more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-makes-5-promises-to-everyone-in-america-we-will-ensure-your-electricity-bill-does-not-increase-and-4-more/articleshow/126517590.cms,"Microsoft has stepped up with an ambitious five-step framework aimed at alleviating public unease surrounding AI data centers. The company's commitments include covering electricity expenses in full, ensuring water replenishment, supporting local job creation, honoring property taxes, and facilitating free AI education. These actions are crafted to heal community rifts and safeguard residents against potential spikes in utility bills.

Microsoft will ask utilities to charge it more for electricity

Data centers will replenish more water than they consume

Construction and operations jobs go to local residents first

No asking for property tax breaks from local governments

Free AI training for schools, libraries, and small businesses





Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over AI data centers, promising Americans that its massive infrastructure buildout won't jack up their power bills or drain their water supplies.The announcement came Tuesday after the US President Donald Trump called out the tech giant on Truth Social, saying Microsoft would be ""first up"" among Big Tech companies to commit to keeping utility costs down for everyday households. ""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump wrote Monday night.Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged the backlash head-on. ""When I visit communities around the country, people have questions—pointed questions,"" Smith said at an event in Great Falls, Virginia. ""We are at a moment of time when we need to listen.""The company's first commitment is perhaps its boldest. Microsoft says it will work with utility companies and state commissions to set electricity rates high enough to cover the full cost of powering its data centers. The goal is to prevent those costs from trickling down to residential customers who never asked for an AI revolution in their backyard.Water usage has been a flashpoint for data center opponents.Microsoft is promising to return more water to local communities than its facilities withdraw. In Phoenix, for instance, the company has partnered with municipalities to find and fix leaks in aging pipe systems.Microsoft is teaming up with North America's Building Trades Unions to train workers in regions where data centers are being built. The company also plans to expand its Datacenter Academy program through local community colleges for ongoing operations roles.Most big corporations haggle for tax breaks when they roll into town. Microsoft says it won't. The company is committing to pay full property taxes wherever it builds. In Quincy, Washington — a small agricultural community where Microsoft opened its first data center back in 2008 — county tax revenues have jumped from $60 million to over $180 million. That money helped the town open a new 54,000-square-foot medical center last year while rural hospitals elsewhere were shutting down.Microsoft is pledging to partner with K-12 schools, community colleges, and local libraries to provide AI literacy training. Small businesses will also get access to AI tools and workforce development resources.The promises come after Microsoft scrapped a data center project in Caledonia, Wisconsin last October following intense community opposition. Hundreds of residents in Michigan also turned out Monday night to protest another proposed Microsoft facility.","Microsoft has unveiled a five-point plan to address growing public anger over ai data centers.

Authorities allege OnePlus operated a clandestine recruitment scheme through an unapproved Hong Kong shell company, violating laws governing mainland Chinese business operations in Taiwan.

OnePlus required Taiwan's approval to hire local workers, which it didn't

Taiwan cracking down hard on Chinese firms eyeing its chip talent





Taiwanese prosecutors want to arrest Pete Lau. The OnePlus CEO allegedly ran an illegal hiring operation that quietly scooped up more than 70 engineers from the island over the past decade. The Shilin District Prosecutors Office dropped the warrant, charging Lau under Taiwan's Cross-Strait Act. This law governs how businesses from mainland China can operate in Taiwan. Two Taiwanese nationals who reportedly helped Lau have also been indicted, according to Bloomberg.Here's what prosecutors say happened. OnePlus allegedly created a shell company in Hong Kong with a completely different name. Then in 2015, it opened a branch in Taiwan without bothering to get government approval. The team there worked on smartphone software, running tests and verification for OnePlus devices.That's the catch. Under the Cross-Strait Act, any mainland Chinese company needs explicit permission from Taiwanese authorities to recruit local talent. Prosecutors claim OnePlus skipped this step entirely while quietly building its engineering bench.Lau isn't some obscure executive either. He co-founded OnePlus and turned it into a brand that smartphone enthusiasts actually care about.These days, he also runs the product division at Oppo, which made OnePlus an independent sub-brand back in 2021.This warrant fits into a bigger pattern. Taiwan has been aggressively going after what it sees as talent poaching by Chinese tech companies. The island's semiconductor engineers are basically a national treasure at this point.Last August, authorities opened investigations into 16 Chinese companies for allegedly targeting high-tech workers. And in 2025, prosecutors issued a similar warrant for Grace Wang, the chair of Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry.OnePlus says business continues as usual despite the probe. Lau hasn't said anything publicly.","Taiwanese prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for oneplus ceo pete lau. They say he illegally hired over 70 engineers from the island.

When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos agreed that AI is in an 'industrial bubble' with investors who ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-agreed-that-ai-is-in-an-industrial-bubble-with-investors-who-/articleshow/126354742.cms,"‘AI is for real’



Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Meta shifts focus from Metaverse to AI





Facebook parent company Meta has begun restructuring of its Reality Labs division, initiating job cuts that are expected to impact more than 1,000 employees, a report has said. According to Bloomberg, affected employees were notified starting Tuesday morning (January 13 US time) following an internal memo from Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth.The report claims that in the post, Bosworth called the cuts as a necessary step to create a “more sustainable” business model for the division. It also signals a strategic backstep from the company’s focus on the “metaverse” in favour of opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI) wearables and mobile integration.“With the larger potential user base and the fastest growth rate today, we are shifting teams and resources almost exclusively to mobile to continue to accelerate adoption there,” Bosworth wrote, according to Bloomberg report.Reality Labs has been the primary focus for Meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception. The division reportedly employs roughly 15,000 workers. While the company has not officially confirmed the total number of departures, the report suggest the reduction will hit approximately 10% of the division's workforce.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the shift in strategy, noting that the company had previously signaled a shift from purely virtual environments toward wearable technology, like Ray-Ban Meta Glasses.“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from metaverse toward wearables. This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,” the spokesperson told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, a separate report claims that Meta and EssilorLuxottica are considering doubling the production capacity of smart glasses to 20 million units annually by the end of this year. Bloomberg News reported that the potential increase is driven by strong demand, and may also see capacity exceed 30 million units.","Reality labs has been the primary focus for meta’s virtual and augmented reality ambitions but the unit has bled billions since its inception.
