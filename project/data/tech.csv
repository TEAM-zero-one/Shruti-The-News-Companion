NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.This notification comes barely a month before the scheduled rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), or barrierless tolling, on around half a dozen stretches of the NH network.The notification was issued early this week. Work of MLFF is at an advanced stage at Manoharpur and Shahjahanpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, at Chorasi on the Surat-Vadodara stretch of NH-48 and at Gharonda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway. The changes in Central Motor Vehicles Rules are expected to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one skips paying toll when barrierless tolling is implemented.On MLFF stretches, there will be no physical barrier to stop vehicles for the collection of user fee. As per the notification, any “unpaid user fee” will be linked with the NOCs for vehicle related services and transactions. It defines unpaid user fee as the user fee payable by a vehicle for use of a section of NH, where the electronic toll collection system has recorded the passage of such vehicle but has not received the applicable user fee levied.Officials said that soon there will be a portal where people will be able to raise their complaints for settling disputes. “There will be enough scope for settlement before initiating action of blocking the NOC,” an official said.The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.

Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro's elite endorsement deals

Tyreek Hill, or popularly known as “Cheetah,"" built his wealth by turning speed into production every Sunday. Keeta Vaccaro, however, followed a quieter but calculated path through entrepreneurship. Their financial story sits at the intersection of elite NFL money and modern startup culture.Hill remains one of football’s highest-paid stars. Meanwhile, Vaccaro continues to operate as an independent entrepreneur. Although their paths now run separately, their combined net worth still reflects how far each had climbed by the time they eventually split up.Tyreek Hill’s net worth is estimated at $60 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. His annual salary sits close to $30 million.However, the real jump came in March 2022, when Hill signed a four-year, $120 million deal with the Miami Dolphins. In August 2024, the Dolphins restructured the contract to $90 million over three years with $65 million guaranteed, increasing his total guaranteed money to $106.5 million.Even though contracts define the numbers, performance keeps them alive. Hill followed his 1,799-yard 2023 season with another Pro Bowl year in 2024.He remained Miami’s offensive engine, finishing among league leaders in yards and explosive plays.Hill also invested heavily in real estate, including a $6.9 million mansion in Southwest Ranches, purchased in May 2022.Keeta Vaccaro’s net worth ranges between $7 million and $8 million, as reported by Sportskeeda. Though often labeled an influencer, Vaccaro operates primarily as an entrepreneur. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2019 with a degree in entrepreneurship and marketing. She later launched Own Flow, a fitness platform, and Investacess, a startup funding app.Even though her income lacks the visibility of NFL contracts, her value sits in equity, digital products, and long-term brand positioning.Together, Hill and Vaccaro have a combined net worth of $67 million to $68 million. However, that figure leaned heavily toward Hill’s NFL earnings. Vaccaro’s wealth reflected business valuation rather than liquid cash. Their combined financial peak aligned with the 2024 NFL season, though they separated in April 2025.Cheetah has partnered with famous brands like Adidas, Grip Boost, and other performance brands. On Sept 12, 2024, during a Dolphins media availability, Hill said endorsements only last “as long as the work stays right on the field.” Vaccaro partnered with fitness, wellness, and tech brands, often integrating her own products into collaborations.Ultimately, money followed results. Hill’s production protected his contracts. Vaccaro’s consistency protected her businesses. Tyreek Hill earned his fortune through speed and dominance.

Nathan Lukes’ journey from the minor-league grind to steady MLB earnings between 2016 and 2026



For Nathan Lukes, success in Major League Baseball did not come quickly or easily. His path has been defined by patience, adaptability, and a willingness to keep pushing through long seasons away from the spotlight. Drafted in the later rounds, Lukes entered professional baseball knowing every opportunity would have to be earned.Financial stability was not immediate, and his early years were shaped by modest minor-league earnings. Under the Toronto Blue Jays, however, Lukes has now used years of preparation to attain a meaningful role, and his net worth timeline of 2016-2026 represents a career of constant advancement as opposed to early hype.Between 2016 and 2019, Lukes spent his seasons in minor leagues where he was not well-paid but was compelled to grow. He emphasized on making himself a regular hitter, enhance his on-base abilities and adding some flexibility in his defense around the field. Although his net worth was not increasing as rapidly at this time, his dependability continued to keep him advancing in the professional baseball arena.Lukes then proceeded with refining his game between 2020 and 2022 but coping with organizational changes.This was his breakthrough year, as in 2022, during Triple-A at Buffalo, he demonstrated all-around offensive output and a quickness on the bases, which put his name squarely on the Toronto radar. The performance got him a place on the 40-man roster of the Blue Jays and this was a definite change in opportunity and earning power.Lukes first made it to the majors in 2023, when he became formally listed on the payroll of the major league. Constant injuries and roster rivalry restricted his action both in 2023 and 2024, though both efforts provided financial security and experience. This was reinforced by his good performance in the end of the 2024 season which was marked by his first home run in his career.In 2025, Lukes earned a pre-arbitration salary of $720,000, and this has further increased his tally in net worth, which is estimated to be $397,099 ( according to Salary Sports). In 2026, continued service time and consistent production could further raise his earnings. Nathan Lukes’ story is a reminder that in baseball, persistence can be just as valuable as raw talent.","Nathan lukes’ journey from the minor-league grind to steady mlb earnings between 2016 and 2026.

Market value and early career earnings compared between Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya

Future earning potential and contracts of Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya revealed

When comparing a professional baseball player who has been performing over the years to an emerging baseball player who has just stepped onto the field, it is evident that Carson Kelly’s net worth is much higher than the overall net worth of Miguel Amaya. Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya are significant players of the Chicago Cubs, a reputed Major League Baseball team.According to reports from 2025, Carson Kelly's annual net worth is estimated at around $5 million, with the figure expected to increase in the coming season. On the other hand, Miguel Amaya’s current net worth is still not disclosed to the public because of his pre-arbitration phase. Some sources suggest that Miguel Amaya's current net worth is around $1.3 million.Carson Kelly has been a significant player in Major League Baseball for many years, and it has helped him land a huge contract and a signing bonus with his former teams, which have significantly increased his annual net worth. Currently, it is reported that Carson Kelly is a player of the Chicago Cubs who has recently signed a two-year contract worth an annual package of around $11 million, including a bonus.Even though he will be receiving one of his highest salaries from the Chicago Cubs, Carson Kelly’s annual net worth still stands at $5 million as per the latest financial report.On the other hand, Miguel Amaya’s current net worth is much lower than Carson Kelly’s, as he’s an emerging player, and he is currently receiving the standard wage for his baseball leagues. Further, Miguel Amaya's financial profile remains under his club's control.Miguel Amaya has less experience in his professional baseball career than Carson Kelly, which is one of the factors for his low net worth at present. Further, there is no report suggesting that either player, Carson Kelly or Miguel Amaya, is involved in any kind of outsourced income, such as private ventures or brand endorsements.Given their performance and consistency in the leagues, it is believed that both Carson Kelly and Miguel Amaya will be staying for a long time in the leagues if not injured. However, when professional experience is compared, Carson Kelly has a much higher earning potential than Miguel Amaya, which will significantly increase his net worth in the coming years.Also Read: Alex Rodriguez net worth timeline (2016 to 2026): How the MLB star built his fortune through business, real estate and more","Carson kelly and miguel amaya are significant players of the chicago cubs, a reputed major league baseball team.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income. His December 2025 fight vs Jake Paul was another big payday. This pushed his net worth toward $150 million.Outside the ring, Joshua has invested in real estate and business ventures through his company, 258 Group. These assets give him income beyond boxing.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon musk, tesla, spacex, and x’s ceo, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

Why solid rocket motors matter

Small suppliers under pressure

A shrinking industrial base

The ripple effect risk

How companies are responding

Pentagon funding and lingering gaps





As conflicts from Venezuela to West Asia drive a renewed surge in US demand for missiles and munitions, a less visible but increasingly critical bottleneck is emerging deep inside the American defence supply chain. The problem is not a lack of missile designs or prime contractors, but a growing shortage of solid rocket motors and, more importantly, the specialised materials and components needed to produce them, according to reporting by Breaking Defense.Senior industry executives told Breaking Defense that while the Pentagon is pushing to rapidly expand munitions stockpiles, the fragile and highly concentrated supply chain that underpins solid rocket motors has not kept pace. This mismatch is raising concerns about whether the United States can scale missile production fast enough in a prolonged, multi-theatre crisis environment.Solid rocket motors power many of the US military’s most important weapons, including the Army’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System and the Navy’s Standard Missile family. Demand for these systems has surged in recent years as Washington replenishes stocks drawn down by support for allies and prepares for high-intensity conflicts.That surge has encouraged new players to enter the market and pushed established manufacturers to expand. However, executives say growth at the top has not been matched by growth at the lower tiers of the supply chain, where many critical parts and chemicals are produced by just one or two suppliers.“We don’t really need a third solid rocket motor provider,” L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik said in September. “We need more companies that make nozzles. We need more companies that make igniters. We need more companies that make cases.”One example highlighted by Breaking Defense is Helicon Chemical Company, a small Orlando-based firm trying to become a second supplier for HTPB-45M, a binding agent used in most solid rocket motors. Helicon planned to set up production in West Virginia, backed by a $15 million Pentagon contract. That funding has been stalled by budget uncertainty.“The situation is aggravated by the ongoing lapse in the Small Business Innovation Research program,” Helicon CEO Jack Sarnicki told Breaking Defense, adding that another government shutdown could be devastating.“Everything has come to a screeching halt,” Sarnicki said. “If we don’t get under contract and another government shutdown occurs, we could have real issues with my company. We would probably have to think about laying off people.”Even if funding resumes, Helicon estimates it would take 18 months to two years to qualify production, meaning every delay directly extends the timeline before a second supplier becomes available.According to defence analytics firm Govini, the US industrial base for solid rocket motors has dramatically narrowed over the past three decades. Between 1995 and 2017, the number of US providers fell from six to just two, Orbital ATK, now part of Northrop Grumman, and Aerojet Rocketdyne, acquired by L3Harris in 2023. A third producer, Norway-based Nammo, manufactures some motors overseas.While startups such as Anduril, Ursa Major and X-Bow, along with firms like General Dynamics, are now trying to expand capacity, Govini warns that many critical inputs remain single-source or have long lead times.“The Department leadership has a real opportunity right now,” Govini CEO Tara Murphy Dougherty told Breaking Defense. “But as of right now, they’re going to do things the exact same way and somehow expect different results from a supply chain management perspective.”One of the biggest vulnerabilities lies in energetics, the chemicals that enable propulsion. Govini notes that American Pacific Corporation is the only US-based producer of ammonium perchlorate, a key propellant ingredient, creating what it calls a “single point of failure.”Nammo encountered a similar risk in 2025, when a chemical supplier for one of its propellants went out of business without an alternative source. Andy Davis, Nammo’s vice president of engineering and strategy, explained why such disruptions are hard to fix quickly.“One of the challenges you have that people don’t understand is a propellant formulation is made up of, say, 10 to 12 ingredients,” Davis said. “So if you take, say, aluminum powder, and you’ve qualified a formulation with one aluminum powder and that manufacturer no longer supplies that aluminum, it’s not as simple as ‘I’m just going to go get another aluminum powder and put it in.’”Replacing a single ingredient can force companies to requalify the propellant, the rocket motor and sometimes the entire missile, a process that can take years.The risks are not theoretical. In October, an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in Tennessee killed 16 people and destroyed a facility that Govini identified as a sub-tier supplier to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Northrop and Nammo.“This should be a wake up call,” Murphy Dougherty said. “There’s just a lack of redundancy for a lot of these components and parts in critical systems like solid rocket motors.”To work around bottlenecks, companies are adopting different strategies. Anduril is pushing suppliers to expand into adjacent components and, in some cases, teaching them new manufacturing techniques.“We’ve fired motors with that case,” said Bret Perry, Anduril’s head of growth for rocket motor systems, referring to a supplier it helped transition into making motor cases.Ursa Major is betting on vertical integration, producing more components in-house. “We’re actually buying powder and sintering it ourselves,” said Bill Murray, the company’s vice president of product and engineering.Large primes are also investing heavily. L3Harris has spent more than $250 million on long-lead materials and supplier upgrades, while Northrop Grumman says it has invested over $1 billion across its solid rocket motor facilities and plans to double output over four years.Congress has allocated billions of dollars to shore up the solid rocket motor industrial base, including hundreds of millions specifically for second-source suppliers. The Pentagon has awarded contracts to expand nozzle and motor case production and to prototype new manufacturing techniques.Yet for small suppliers like Helicon, the gap between policy intent and on-the-ground reality remains wide.“We’re a small company way down the food chain,” Sarnicki said. “You’ll read the articles that Raytheon gets a huge contract, or Northrop gets it. Everything seems great. But you have to be able to produce it.”As the US accelerates missile production amid global instability, Breaking Defense reports that the success of that effort may hinge less on headline contracts and more on whether the Pentagon can stabilise and diversify the vulnerable supply chains that sit far from public view.",The pentagon is pushing to rapidly expand munitions stockpiles. But the fragile and highly concentrated supply chain that underpins solid rocket motors has not kept pace. This mismatch is raising concerns about whether the united states can scale missile production fast enough in a prolonged crisis.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126549270,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1478831,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

“No accountability”

“Mount Rushmore”

Kai Cenat confronts Twitch CEO Dan Clancy over Mount Rushmore comments

“clipping culture”





Kai Cenat is back in the headlines for a new controversy, after he uploaded unseen footage of a tense encounter with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy. The video was taken during the Streamer Awards of 2025, where it was uploaded by Kai with a caption that read. The leaked video reopened a debate that began months earlier, when Clancy made comments about Twitch’sof streamers during an appearance on Mizkif’s stream. Those remarks appeared to downplay Kai’s status compared to older, more established creators.The issue traces back to October 2025, when Clancy initially told Kai face to face during Mafiathon 3 that he belonged on the platform’s Mount Rushmore. Later, on Mizkif’s stream, Clancy changed his tone, saying he only included Kai because Kai had asked him directly. This shift upset Kai, who felt the Twitch CEO had contradicted himself and failed to take responsibility for what he had said earlier.In the leaked footage, Clancy approaches Kai to explain himself, claiming that the viral clip from Mizkif’s stream was edited and taken out of context. He says the conversation was more about how people define Mount Rushmore, arguing that it usually highlights historical figures rather than current top performers. Clancy added that if the list focused on who is at their peak right now, creators like Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed would clearly be at the top.Kai hit back hard, saying Clancy was a liar who changed his story to suit the situation. He said Clancy had told Mizkif that Kai was only included because he asked, which completely contradicted what he had said earlier.The moment quickly became a flashpoint for wider debate within the streaming community.Reactions were mixed. Mizkif defended Clancy, blamingfor creating confusion and noting that the CEO had still praised Kai as one of the greatest streamers. Meanwhile, Kick executive Andrew Santamaria used the drama to publicly recruit Kai. Reddit users were split, with some calling the feud unnecessary and others criticizing Clancy’s handling of the situation.In the end, the controversy highlights ongoing tensions between platform leadership and top creators, showing how quickly private conversations can turn into public disputes in the streaming world.Also Read: IShowSpeed makes streaming history with first-ever live stream inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid","Kai cenat uploaded unseen footage of a tense encounter with twitch ceo dan clancy.

What were Sidney Crosby's major investments between 2016 and 2026

Also Read:

Sidney Crosby is easily one of the greatest hockey players of all time. From his dominance in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins to his winning back-to-back gold with Team Canada at the Olympics, he has been sensational for the past 20 years.But between him leading the Penguins to consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017 to him surpassing franchise legend Mario Lemieux's record for being the all-time in points, more than a decade has passed. And in those ten years, not only his accolades but also his wealth has grown substantially. As the hockey world evolves financially, his decade-old decisions make it feel that 2026 is the new 2016 for business prospects.Since being drafted #1 overall by the Penguins at the 2005 NHL Draft, Crosby has remained the centerpiece of the franchise. His importance to the team also meant some of the biggest NHL contracts of all time. While his three-year $11.1 entry-level contract had an AAV of $3.7 million, his annual cap hit was just $850,000.But that soon changed. By the time he won his first Stanley Cup in 2009, he had re-signed with the Penguins with a 5-year, $43.5 million extension.But this was only the beginning. By 2016, he had signed the second-largest NHL contract of all time at that point.With a 12-year, $104.4 million deal to his name, he was climbing fast on the list of highest-earning NHL players of all time. In fact, he had $15.4 million in earnings in the 2016-17 season alone from a combination of his NHL salary, performance bonuses, and endorsement deals.As of January 2026, he remains one of the highest-paid NHL players of all time. His current net worth stands at $75 million. That's a $20 million rise from his $55 million net worth back in 2016. But since then, Crosby has signed his latest deal with the Penguins.Crosby signed a two-year, $17.4 million deal with Pittsburgh at an AAV of $8.7 million, which will again add to his total career earnings. He already crossed a significant milestone in June 2021 when he crossed franchise legend Jaromir Jagr’s career earnings total of $127 million.It was already $129 million by then. A sharp rise from the humble $46.9 million in 2016. But that figure pales in comparison to his current earnings total of $165.67 million. That puts him just behind Alex Ovechkin in career earnings. But Crosby also has multiple ventures off the ice.Beyond the NHL salary and the lucrative performance bonuses, Crosby also has multiple endorsement deals to his name. They have made him a familiar face in his native Canada while also supplementing his on-ice earnings.He signed an important multi-year deal with Adidas in 2015, which kicked off in late 2016 to effectively replace his previous footwear partner, Reebok. The deal is estimated to have brought in anywhere between $1 million and $1.5 million annually over its six-year span till 2021.He also renewed his decade-old deal with Gatorade, which started in 2005 for merely $300,000 CDN, but over the years has expanded to millions per year. He also extended longstanding partnerships with brands like Tim Hortons, CCM, and Bell Canada.Beyond his brand deals, Crosby has ventured into real estate to build continued wealth. This included investing in multiple properties in both Canada and the United States. While none have been reported to have been bought after 2016, Crosby continued to invest in the pieces over the years.However, one of his more recent endorsement deals came when he was named the brand ambassador for Lululemon. Crosby was announced as the face of their campaign for Team Canada/Milano Cortina 2026, but the exact compensation and earnings remain unlisted.In addition, reports also suggested that he has acquired an equity stake in Swiss watchmaker NORQAIN. The exact nature and numbers of the deal are not yet made public, but Crosby remains a shareholder and a business partner.Throughout the 2016-2026 period, Crosby maintained his reputation as one of hockey's most respected figures, known equally for his dominance on the ice and his quiet generosity off it. His approach to wealth management combined smart contract negotiations, selective endorsements, strategic investments, and meaningful philanthropy, creating a financial legacy that extends well beyond his playing career.","Sidney crosby is easily one of the greatest hockey players of all time.

Omi In A Hellcat released after serving time for illegal IPTV operation





A viral video circulating on social media this week showed YouTuber Omi In A Hellcat walking out of federal custody, marking the end of a long-running and high-profile criminal case. The short clip, shared widely on X, captured the moment he was greeted by friends after his release, quickly drawing thousands of reactions. His release closes a chapter that has followed the creator since 2019, when federal investigators first began examining his activities. For many online viewers, the video symbolized the fall and return of a once-flamboyant internet personality whose lifestyle had drawn both admiration and scrutiny.Omi In A Hellcat, whose real name is Bill Omar Carrasquillo, is a 39-year-old content creator from New Jersey with strong ties to Philadelphia. He rose to fame in the late 2010s through YouTube videos showing luxury cars, custom vehicle builds, jewelry, and an expensive lifestyle. At his peak, his channel had over 800,000 subscribers. Behind the scenes, however, federal prosecutors say that much of his wealth came from an illegal IPTV business that secretly generated millions of dollars while distributing pirated television content.According to federal authorities, Carrasquillo operated an illegal service called Gears TV Reloaded between 2016 and 2019. The operation sold modified Amazon Firesticks and monthly subscriptions that gave users access to more than 1,000 pirated TV channels, movies, live sports, and pay-per-view events. This content was taken without permission from major providers such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS, and DirecTV. Investigators later concluded the business earned more than $30 million in revenue.Carrasquillo and a number of his accomplices were indicted on a number of different federal charges, including copyright infringement, wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. In 2022, he pleaded guilty to 62 charges. In 2023, a year later, he received a 66-month federal prison term, with three years of supervised release. He was further ordered to forfeit around $30 million worth of his assets, including cash, jewelry, property, and 57 automobiles, all of which were later auctioned off.He was released near January 6, 2026, after serving approximately three years, with an early release because of his exemplary conduct and the time he had already served. This particular incident serves as a reminder of the severe legal implications that come with digital piracy and how notoriety on the internet can be swiftly disintegrated when illicit methods of doing business are employed.Also Read: Kai Cenat clashes with Twitch CEO Dan Clancy after leaked Streamer Awards footage","Omi in a hellcat released after serving time for illegal iptv operation.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, Huang's betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang wants engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations.

OpenAI’s Fidji Simo welcomes Barret Zoph and two others

Shake-up major win for OpenAI





Mira Murati has confirmed that chief technology officer of her AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Barret Zoph is leaving. Murati shared a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) where she said “We have parted ways with Barret Zoph”. She continued: “Soumith Chintala will be the new CTO of Thinking Machines. He is a brilliant and seasoned leader who has made important contributions to the AI field for over a decade, and he’s been a major contributor to our team. We could not be more excited to have him take on this new responsibility”.Zoph is not the only one leaving. Luke Metz, a co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab, and Sam Schoenholz are also exiting the company. All three were previously employees at OpenAI and will now return to OpenAI after their exit in 2024 to start the AI firm.Now, two narratives have formed about Barret Zoph’s exit from Thinking Machines Lab.One of the two narratives we talked above is what Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI shared online. In a welcome post, Somo says that the exit “has been in the works for several weeks”.“Excited to welcome Barret Zoph, Luke Metz, and Sam Schoenholz back to OpenAI! This has been in the works for several weeks, and we’re thrilled to have them join the team.Barret will report to me; Luke and Sam will report into Barret. More to come on what they’ll focus on soon!,” she wrote in the post.According to a Wired report, Simo also sent a memo to staff where she claimed that Zoph was considering leaving and was eventually ‘fired’ on Wednesday, January 14. In the memo, Simo says that OpenAI doesn’t share the “same concerns” about Zoph as Thinking Machines Lab CEO Mira Murati.The concerns, which is also the second narrative, included “unethical conduct” on Zoph’s part where he allegedly shared confidential information with the competitors, as claimed by technology reporter Kylie Robison quoting a source close to Thinking Machines.While this personnel is a major blow to Thinking Machines Lab that lost another co-founder, Andrew Tulloch, in November last year. It is a win for ChatGPT maker OpenAI facing ‘big crisis’ amid key executives' departure and the recently announced Apple-Google Gemini deal to power next-generation Siri. OpenAI VP of research Jerry Tworek recently told staff that he’s leaving the company, and shared his exit note publicly on X.Phil Chen, Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI announced that today is his last day at the company.","Mira murati has confirmed that chief technology officer of her ai startup thinking machines lab, barret zoph is leaving.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new structure reveals tension between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, the $14 billion AI recruit. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement stifling, while staff question his leadership for Meta's AI ambitions. A recent strategy clash highlighted differing priorities, with Wang pushing for cutting-edge AI over immediate product integration.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. Meta's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.","Meta's new structure reveals tension between mark zuckerberg and alexandr wang, the $14 billion ai recruit.
