“You make mistakes as a person, but it sucks that you have to go through something like that with someone that you care about, and now it’s all over the Internet,”

“Half of what you see in the media is true. Half of what you see is not true. So, people pick their side of the story and run with it. The people that know the truth know the truth. But it’s been difficult.”

“I didn’t break up with him because he was cheating. I broke up with him because of who he was.” The clip quickly went viral after Hanna also claimed “nobody likes him.”

Carson Beck, the 22-year-old quarterback now playing for the Miami Hurricanes, has spoken publicly for the first time about his breakup with Hanna Cavinder. Beck described the split as a “difficult” part of his life during an interview with ESPN in late September 2025. The two had dated for almost a year before breaking up in spring 2025.

The 22-year-old quarterback has since focused on his first season at Miami. In his first four games, he completed 73 percent of his passes for nearly 1,000 yards and led the Hurricanes to four straight wins.Breakup rumors first began in March 2025 when Hanna Cavinder deleted photos of Carson Beck from her Instagram. Soon after, her twin sister Haley Cavinder posted a cryptic TikTok aboutIn April 2025, Hanna Cavinder appeared on a YouTube vlog with Kai Trump, granddaughter of Donald Trump, during UFC 314 in Miami.When asked about the breakup, Hanna said:Earlier in February 2025, both Carson Beck and Hanna Cavinder had also faced off-field issues when their Lamborghini and Mercedes were stolen from outside their Miami home. The couple’s problems continued until the breakup became public in spring.While Hanna Cavinder has spoken freely about the split in social videos, Beck has chosen to stay private until his September 2025 ESPN interview, where he admitted it has been a tough learning period for him.","Carson beck, the 22-year-old quarterback now playing for the miami hurricanes, has spoken publicly for the first time about his breakup with hanna cavinder.

How To Update To Minecraft 1.21.9 The Copper Age For FREE! - Java & Bedrock

How to download 1.21.9, the Copper Age update for Minecraft: Java Edition

Open the Minecraft Launcher. Go to the Installations tab. Enable snapshots and experimental builds (if necessary), because early releases or pre-releases may appear there. In the installations list, look for “1.21.9 – The Copper Age” or similar naming. If the official release is available, create or select an installation that uses version 1.21.9. Click Play using that installation to launch Minecraft with the updated version. If a world already exists, back it up before launching, because sometimes new updates may change world data.

Minecraft 1.21.9 download methods (including snapshots)

Official release method

Once Mojang has published 1.21.9 as a stable version, it will appear in the list of available versions in the launcher (without needing snapshots).

select “1.21.9 – The Copper Age” from the version dropdown and launch it.

Now the launcher will automatically download all the required files and update the game to this version.

Snapshot / pre-release method

Usually Mojang before the stable release provides snapshots or pre-releases (testing versions) for players to try new features early.

To use these, enable snapshots or pre-releases in the Installations tab.

Select a snapshot of 1.21.9 (or the latest pre-release) from the list.

Always back up existing worlds, since snapshots can potentially corrupt saves.

Play using that snapshot version.

When the final 1.21.9 release becomes available, it can replace your snapshot version safely (if you choose to switch).

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,” Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation.""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

Poll Should companies clarify the data storage and hosting practices to the public? Yes, it's critical. No, it's not necessary.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

The engineer who taught a machine to make rotis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/the-engineer-who-taught-a-machine-to-make-rotis/articleshow/124281658.cms,".

200 million rotis served



.





A roti, Pranoti Nagarkar likes to say, is a non Newtonian fluid—its behaviour shifts with pressure, temperature and time. That scientific itch sits at the heart of Rotimatic, the robot she conceived to automate a task millions consider both quotidian and maddening. “You don’t have perfect parameters every time,” she says. “Even humans adjust along the way.” The machine she imagined had to develop the same instinct: to sense, decide and correct in real time so a single button-press could yield a hot, well-puffed roti, again and again.Nagarkar traces the idea to her years in Singapore as a mechanical-engineering student and young product designer. “I’m a builder by nature,” she says. “I learnt how to take an appliance from concept to a working prototype—then the harder leap to a robust, manufacturable product.” In 2008 she co-founded Zimplistic with software engineer and husband Rishi Israni, who is the CTO of the firm. “Rotimatic needed a brain after all,” she says.To actually build the product, Pranoti began by deconstructing the ritual of making a roti. “You’re automating several major actions—measuring and dispensing flour, water and oil; making a dough ball; transferring; flattening; cooking to flame-like finish; and ejecting,” she says.And all of this had to be done within a form factor that would be suitable for your average kitchen. “I set a microwaveish form factor and refused to grow beyond it and so built a thermocol mock-up to freeze the size, then hand-built rigs to prove pressing and kneading. The commercial machine still matches that early silhouette,” she says.The pivotal design choice, Pranoti says, that helped Rotimatic become a practical machine that works, was the decision to design the machine to make one dough ball at a time. “In homes you batch-knead, then divide. We eliminated that. We micro-knead instead—smaller mass, higher precision.” That did raise complexity however. “Any time you go micro, your resolution and tolerances get brutal,” she says. “We had to achieve lab-like repeatability with commodity parts. ”The sensing philosophy of the machine in a way mirrors human judgement. “We studied flours—for example ragi absorbs water differently to cornmeal—but data tables weren’t enough to solve the problem,” she says. “Humans feel dough. So we built a tactile-sensing system with off-the-shelf sensors, then taught the machine to adjust flour-water-oil ratios and kneading dynamics on the fly.”While the company has IP that has been published for their tech, Pranoti says the hard part is the internal knowhow—how each sensor talks to the algorithm, how decisions happen every second.Making sure the machine was connected to the net was also a deliberate choice that turned out to be crucial for its long term success. “IoT wasn’t fashionable decor for us,” she says. “We needed over-the-air recipes, diagnostics and remote fixes because our users were spread worldwide.” That telemetry later underpinned support. “The machine knows its own health—motor currents, sensor drift, even cleaning lapses—and we can nudge maintenance or push targeted fixes without a service visit. ”So far, 200 million rotis have been served in more than 100,000 homes across 58 countries, with the United States as the biggest market. “That early diaspora demand gave us the runway to keep improving,” she says.A dedicated user base has even stretched the machine’s repertoire. “People are wonderfully inventive,” she says. “They add protein powders, spices, multi-grain mixes. Rotimatic takes a couple of cycles to learn and then remembers. That adaptiveness is magic.” The firm publishes official profiles for millets and gluten-free flours, but she’s happiest when customers experiment. “As long as it’s dry ingredients, go ahead,” she says laughing.Manufacturing the actual machine followed a classic scale-up arc. “We tooled in Malaysia to begin with—invested in moulds, set up a line, trained technicians— and shipped to our early adopters,” she says. “As we matured, we relocated manufacturing to the Bengaluru– Mysuru region to be closer to engineering, suppliers and our India roadmap.” The India move also reflected affordability goals. “Cost matters,” she says. “Bringing the supply chain home helps us keep improving the price-to-value equation.”The newest iteration of the product is Rotimatic NEXT. “We’ve put a camera behind the door and added vision AI now,” she says. “If a roti puffs and pops a hole, the system can ‘see’ weak gluten bonds and strengthen kneading on the very next dough ball—for that specific flour.” Extra sensors in the kneading assembly sharpen its grasp of flour–water–oil ratios. “It’s the same idea taken further: more eyes and ears, better decisions, better food,” she says.","Pranoti nagarkar, co-founder of zimplistic, created rotimatic to make rotis. 200 million rotis have been served in more than 100,000 homes across 58 countries, with the united states as the biggest market.

WHO recommends Qure.ai



Built GenAI solution before ChatGPT







Ankit Modi’s journey with Qure.ai could have ended almost as soon as it began. He had an offer from Epic Systems in the US, and though the company’s first H-1B application for Ankit failed, it succeeded the following year. But by then, he had started Qure.ai with Prashant Warier and Preetham Putha, and Ankit was in a huge dilemma. “The choice was stark – stay back and build Qure with Prashant, Preetham, and the others, or move to Wisconsin to work in healthcare,” he recalls.The decision hinged on what he calls ₹reversibility’. Moving to the US could always be an option later if Qure didn’t work out, he told himself. Lengthy talks with Prashant, and a look at Qure’s talented founding team convinced Ankit this was the team he wanted to grow with. And he took the decision to stay even though his experience with a previous fitness offerings and healthy food venture called CrankOut had shown him that success takes more than just hard work or a strong team. “The right people, the right technology, and the right timing all must align – and even then, nothing is guaranteed,” he says.Today, Modi has no reason to look back on his decision. And he finds himself in the US very often, because a lot of Qure’s business comes from that country.Prashant, Preetham, Ankit and Bhargava Reddy founded Qure.ai in 2016 as a health-tech company leveraging deep learning and AI to make healthcare more accessible. Its solutions analyse medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to aid in the early detection and management of various diseases such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, and stroke.Ankit recalls that a chance flathunting connection led him to Prashant, whose company, Imagna Analytics, had just been acquired by analytics company Fractal. And Ankit was keen to learn from someone who had successfully built and exited a venture. Though he was exploring ideas with others, Prashant’s experience and track record stood out.“One of our first milestones was becoming the first AI company in the world to get published in The Lancet, and at the time, we didn’t even realise how big that was until doctors started telling us. When Covid-19 hit, starting in Lombardy, in Italy, San Rafael Hospital reached out to Qure.ai, prompting the deployment of their chest X-ray algorithm for Covid cases. Six months later, BMC in Mumbai approached the team, bringing significant global attention,” he said.By 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a recommendation allowing Qure’s AI to read chest X-rays in the absence of radiologists, paving the way for worldwide adoption. Today, Qure.ai’s solutions are deployed in over a hundred countries.AstraZeneca recognised that Qure.ai’s algorithm could also detect lung cancer early from chest X-rays and funded its adoption across hospitals worldwide, becoming the first pharma company to see its value. They had a drug, Tagrisso, for stage one and two lung cancer patients but weren’t finding enough patients. They saw Qure’s AI as a way to broaden the funnel.This was soon followed by Merck, Johnson & Johnson, and today, Qure.ai works with at least 10 of the top 20 pharma and medical device companies, including Pfizer, Medtronic, and Cipla.Qure.ai addresses tuberculosis, which is largely a sanitation and healthcare access problem. Countries like Lesotho or Malawi have almost no radiologists – Malawi has just two for the entire country. Community-level screening capturing thousands of X-rays daily would be impossible without AI. WHO has created a funding pathway for AI alongside X-ray machines, and today, many countries procure Qure.ai’s software to detect TB. Together, solutions to detect tuberculosis and lung cancer account for roughly 85% to 90% of Qure.ai’s revenue.Qure.ai’s technology is built on deep learning algorithms. The company began in 2016 using convolutional neural networks, later moving to deep neural networks and transformer-based architectures. Unlike traditional software engineering, deep learning requires domain expertise. Qure.ai’s researchers have, over years of working closely with doctors, effectively become highly skilled radiologists.During development, the team discovered that their algorithm performed better on men’s X-rays than women’s due to biased datasets. To address this, they built a generative AI solution – well before ChatGPT – to create synthetic data representing women with certain conditions. The algorithms were also fine-tuned for different geographies, as X-rays from Kenya, Bihar, or Australia present unique nuances. Detecting tuberculosis, for example, is not merely a technical challenge but a contextual one. To ensure the AI works effectively across diverse settings, Qure.ai’s team of 75 clinicians also travel extensively.Today, Qure employs close to 280 people across Mumbai, Bengaluru, London, US, Dubai, and Africa. “Distribution has become the key moat. Our distribution is very strong in primary healthcare centres, so the plan is to do more there – not just imaging,” says Ankit. The team has launched an app called AIRA, an AI assistant that listens to doctor-patient conversations, suggests better questions, diagnoses, and fills EMRs (electronic medical records) automatically.Qure is now working on COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), to detect early signs of heart failure. Qure has raised $120 million and is valued over $500 million. Ankit says they expect to break even by the next financial year. “Funding will only be for expansion, not survival,” he says.","Qure.ai is a health-tech company leveraging deep learning and ai to make healthcare more accessible.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","October 2025 uae fuel prices rise slightly, practical tips for commuters, families, and middle-class residents to save money.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by hamptons shows that indian investors are followed by nigerians, poles and irish.

To streamline the accommodation process for Hajj 2026, Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah. The initiative, developed through inter-ministerial collaboration, focuses on enhancing service standards, ensuring compliance, and organizing bookings through official digital platforms.The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has formally introduced a temporary hostel licensing service for accommodations catering to pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah during the Hajj season of 1447 AH (2026).

What is TrumpRx? Donald Trump announces new website to offer discounted drug prices; savings expected to reach 50%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/what-is-trumprx-donald-trump-announces-new-website-to-offer-discounted-drug-prices-savings-expected-to-reach-50/articleshow/124246331.cms,"AP file photo





US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as “most-favored-nation” pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,” Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. “Specific terms of the agreement remain confidential,” the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that “Most Favored Nation” pricing is based on a drug’s net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump’s July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid “Most Favored Nation” pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a “Most Favored Nation” pricing policy to address the gap.","The new website is part of a broader push to align us drug prices with those in other developed nations.

BENGALURU: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is under scrutiny as lawmakers in both the US and UK press CEO K Krithivasan for answers regarding the company’s employment practices and cybersecurity protocols. US Senators Charles E Grassley and Richard J Durbin from the senate judiciary committee wrote to TCS CEO K Krithivasan, raising concerns about the company’s hiring practices.The senators said that while TCS laid off around 60 employees at its Jacksonville office, it continues to file large numbers of H-1B visa applications. In the 2025 fiscal, TCS received approval for 5,505 H-1B visas, making it the second-largest employer of newly approved H-1B beneficiaries in the US. The senators asked TCS to clarify whether it prioritises hiring foreign workers over qualified Americans during a period of layoffs.“TCS is already under investigation by the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission for allegedly firing older American workers in favour of newly hired South Asian H-1B employees. TCS is doing itself no favours by replacing Americans with H-1Bs during this investigation,” the letter read.TCS is also facing questions from UK Labour MP Liam Byrne, who wrote to Krithivasan demanding answers about the company’s role in recent cyber incidents at Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer (M&S), and Co-op.In his letter dated Sept 26, Byrne highlighted BBC reports that the M&S breach was triggered by a ransomware email “sent apparently using the account of an employee from TCS.”","Us senators charles e grassley and richard j durbin from the senate judiciary committee wrote to tcs ceo k krithivasan.

MUMBAI: Abu Dhabi’s ruling family-owned International Holding Company (IHC) will acquire a 41.2% stake in Sammaan Capital (formerly Indiabulls Housing) for Rs 8,850 crore. At about $1 billion, this is the largest foreign investment in India’s NBFC space.The investment will be made through preferential allotment of equity and warrants at Rs 139 per share, below Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 170. The acquisition will trigger a mandatory open offer for an additional 26% stake. Depending on the response to the offer, IHC’s holding could rise to around 63.4% on a fully diluted basis.After the transaction, IHC will be classified as promoter and will have the right to appoint a majority of directors. The investment, routed through affiliate Avenir Investment, is subject to regulatory and statutory approvals.“Under IHC’s parentage, we will continue to focus on providing affordable housing finance and mid-market mortgage solutions, leveraging IHC’s technology capabilities,” said Gagan Banga, MD & CEO of Sammaan Capital.

Has Scope To Create Incremental Production Of 10.3L Cr





NEW DELHI: Govt’s efforts to deepen the Indian component ecosystem for electronics has received a massive boost, with domestic and international companies putting in applications for investing over Rs 1.1 lakh crore in new projects, almost twice to the original target. This has the potential to result in creating incremental production to the tune of Rs 10.3 lakh crore, when fully realised.Govt has made it clear that there are no special provisions for getting investors from China and said the “law of the land is well-known” when dealing with investment proposals from countries that share land border with India. Currently, such investment applications are dealt under the Press Note 3 (PN3) provision that was introduced in April 2020. “The process related to such applications is well established,” Electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said when asked specifically on investments from Chinese companies.The minister said the plan is to make India self-sufficient when it comes to supply chain for components, which can cater to various manufacturing industries. Once built, this supply chain will also look at global markets. “Swadeshi (indigenous) electronics components will position Bharat as a global supplier,” Vaishnaw said.A whole host of companies have applied under the scheme and these are believed to include global giants, such as Foxconn and Flex.On the local side, companies such as Tata, Dixon, Amber and Optiemus are understood to have filed applications.Vaishnaw said against an original incremental production target of Rs 4.6 lakh crore through the scheme, which promises benefits of Rs 22,805 crore, the current number of applications (at 249) can scale this up to Rs 10.3 lakh crore. The minister said around 60% of the applications are by Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which would ensure that the supply chain is deep-rooted and exhaustive.The single-biggest investment proposal that the scheme has received is to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore, the minister said, adding that govt will vet the proposals swiftly so that projects can begin faster.The category of ‘enclosures for mobile, IT hardware products &related devices’ has received 16 proposals worth Rs 35,813 crore, while ‘flexible printed circuit board’ and related segment has got 11 proposals worth Rs 16,542 crore. The ‘electro-mechanicals’ category has got 87 applications worth Rs 14,362 crore, and multi-layer PCB has seen 43 applications worth Rs 14,150 crore.Vaishnaw said many categories have received proposals for the first time. He added that govt has asked companies to pursue original design work within India to create local IPs. Sunil Vachani, chairman of Dixon, said the scheme will ensure that current value additions in mobile phones and IT hardware products will jump substantially, which will make India-made products globally competitive.","Govt has made it clear that there are no special provisions for getting investors from china. “swadeshi (indigenous) electronics components will position bharat as a global supplier,” electronics and it minister ashwini vaishnaw said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124280481,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19092,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

IPO Activity Slow In US, But There’s Spate Of Startups Going Public In India: Peak XV’s MD





MUMBAI: India’s capital markets have been resilient, defying global slowdown on the back of robust support from domestic investors, allowing a spate of startups to go public. This has been “the single biggest” positive development for all private market investors, said Shailendra Singh, MD at Peak XV Partners. This is the first time India’s capital markets are strong enough to “decouple” from the US markets and stand on their own, Singh told TOI in an interview.The blue-chip venture capital firm that split from its Silicon Valley parent Sequoia Capital in 2023 as part of a global restructuring has backed several Indian unicorns, three of which — Pine Labs, Meesho and Groww — are headed for a Dalal Street debut in the current financial year.“VCs invest for an 8-10 years’ time horizon... if you invest for 8-9 years but there is no liquidity, there’s a big problem (VCs need to deliver returns to limited partners on their investments). India has really stood out in the last 3-4 years because globally, there has been a downturn. IPO activity, even in the US has been completely meagre for three consecutive years. During that time, you had in India thriving capital markets.If high-scale companies with high quality governance are able to go public, have liquidity... this completes the loop for investors (gives them an exit),” Singh said.“To us, it feels like the capital markets liquidity is an enduring liquidity, not a transient blip because there are enough domestic institutions that are big participants in India’s capital markets. The fact that there is domestic source of strength, not foreign money, makes the market more resilient,” Singh said.While a resilient capital market would nudge more startups to go public in India, not every company should be public and founders need to be careful, said Singh.“If a lot of sub-scale companies go public, there could be windows of illiquidity even in public markets subsequently. It’s much worse to be a small public company than a small private company if you are not in a bull cycle,” Singh said. In all, six of Peak XV’s portfolio firms in India have currently filed for IPO and more would be tapping the public markets, Singh said, without sharing details.For Peak XV Partners, after the split with Sequoia, values driving the company haven’t really changed much although there has been some shift in the investing strategy. The partners want to build Peak XV into a world class global firm anchored in India and APAC.. As it looks to be a global player, the company has set up a team in the US to help Peak expand in the market and scout for opportunities in software and AI, which Singh said is on a “super cycle globally. ”In India, the firm will continue to bet on consumer, fintech, software and AI sectors. Peak XV is not having “FOMO” about quick commerce but sees other promising bets in the consumer space — consumer AI, for instance, could grow as a space in India in the coming years, Singh said.In India, a lot of startups are coming up in the AI application space and there has been a “big” pick up in seed stage funding in AI firms, he said.","India’s capital markets have been resilient, defying global slowdown on the back of robust support from domestic investors.

JP Morgan has an outperform rating on Dixon Technologies with a target price of Rs 19,500. Analysts said the stock has lost around 10% in the last three trading sessions, but they don’t see any fundamental reason behind this fall. They recommended investors to buy this dip for a high-quality earnings compounder over the next three years. While growth will be driven by mobiles over FY25-27, after that, they believe, growth can be supported by non-mobile as it scales up refrigerators, washing machines, IT hardware, telecom and lighting. Analysts also said that the joker in pack is the component manufacturing foray through three entities - JV with HKC, acquisition of Q Tech India, and JV with Chongqing Yuhai. They also believe the catalysts for the stock over the next six months are govt approval on JV with HKC, and updates, if any, on potential renewal of production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for mobiles that is ending in Mar 2026.Jefferies has a buy on CMS Info Systems with the target price cut to Rs 445.

Yet, growth in core revenues may be moderate around 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over FY25-FY30 and margins stable.They feel an uptick in ATM network expansion will be key for the company and in the retail cash segment, the management plans to keep up with aggressive share gains. They also feel tech & payment solutions to see stronger growth. The company may evaluate M&A prospects.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Shriram Finance with the target price at Rs 785.
