Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The supreme court modified its earlier order restraining delhi and ncr authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles. The reprieve would apply only to bs 4 or bs 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles. This order will impact over 14.7 lakh bs 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two- wheelers, buses and goods carriers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126045143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44316,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

NEW DELHI: An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026 and left them unable to return to the US.The user shared their experience in a post on the workplace forum Blind. He said the rescheduling appears linked to a new social media vetting policy. Officials are now reviewing applicants’ posts on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to check for content seen as negative toward the US.“So I am one of those unlucky souls who got hit by the mass rescheduling this week. I had my h1b interview scheduled for December and got an email saying its moved to March 2026. MARCH. That’s literally 3 months away,” the uservwrote.They said the lack of information from employers has made the situation worse. “The worst part is nobody knows what's happening. The immigration team at my company is clueless, HR is giving generic responses like ‘we understand your frustration’ which helps exactly zero percent,” they added.The visa holder said they are currently stuck in India after their I-94 expired and are on unpaid leave.They’ve been relying on personal savings while waiting for updates and said a request to work from his company’s India office had not been answered.The user also noted that starting January 1, visa applicants will be allowed only one free rescheduling. If they miss the March appointment or needs to change it again, a visa fee of about Rs 16,000 will have to be paid.“Thousands of us got hit at the same time. december was supposed to be peak season for h1b stamping and they just wiped out the entire month. people who took expensive flights, booked hotels, all of that just gone,” they wrote.They ended the post by asking if others were facing the same situation and whether they were trying to get emergency appointments or arranging to work from India.The disruptions follow a new US State Department rule announced on December 3 that requires social-media screening for all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents starting December 15. The rule is slowing down interviews, especially at busy consulates in Hyderabad and Chennai, and has led to mass cancellations of appointments originally scheduled for mid-to-late December 2025. Many of these appointments have been pushed into next year, with some as far out as June 2026.The US Embassy in India has warned that arriving on an old appointment date could lead to denial of entry. Immigration lawyers are now advising H-1B holders in the US to avoid non-essential travel.Under the new directive, all H-1B and H-4 applicants must make their social media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity. Experts say this represents one of the largest expansions of digital-footprint scrutiny in the visa process to date.","An h-1b visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their december interview to march 2026.

Barrier-free highway toll collection system by 2026-end: Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/barrier-free-highway-toll-collection-system-by-2026-end-gadkari/articleshow/126047513.cms,".

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Highway commuters won’t have to stop to pay user fee at national highway toll plazas by 2026-end as the govt rolls out the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. He added that the FASTag annual pass launched in Aug, which allows private vehicles to cross 200 plazas, has also come as a big relief for people.Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass. “People will be rid of stopping or slowing down at toll plazas as we roll out the MLFF toll system. Cameras above the road will read the number plate and user fee will be automatically debited from the vehicle FASTag account. All this will happen even when someone is driving at a speed of 80 kmph. I made this announcement in Rajya Sabha today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he said in RS that the new system will help save fuel worth Rs 1,500 crore and increase toll revenue by Rs 6,000 crore. The system will make toll collection transparent and corruption-free, he said.Gadkari also said that a system is being put in place where vehicle owners will have to clear all dues, including pending toll fee and e-challans when they sell their vehicles or renew registration.On the next major focus of highway development in the country, Gadkari said that now there is more thrust on building greenfield highways, which is key to reduce logistics cost. “In India, earlier the logistics cost was 16%. But the latest study by IIM-Bangalore, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Madras indicates that our logistics cost on road has reduced by 6%. The report was out three-four months back. So, I am confident that by now this logistics cost is in single digit at 9%,” he said.He said govt’s focus on infrastructure is driving India’s economic growth. “For the growth of any country, infrastructure is important. Roads, water, power, transport and communication, without developing this infrastructure, we can’t get capital investment in industry and trade & business. And, without investment, we cannot create jobs... Without jobs, we cannot eradicate poverty,” he added.","Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the fastag annual pass.

Risks to Consider

For Seattle Mariners:

For Bo Bichette:

For Toronto Blue Jays:

Seattle Mariners have spent years building a pitching staff that can carry a playoff team. The offense has been good at times, but rarely dependable enough to match it. That gap is why Bo Bichette has emerged as a serious point of interest, whether through free agency or a sign-and-trade setup.Bo Bichette fits where the Mariners have fallen short. He brings contact, consistency, and lineup balance at a time when Seattle’s competitive window is wide open. If the goal is to move from playoff appearances to real title pressure, this is the type of move that changes the team’s profile.The Seattle Mariners win games by preventing runs. Their rotation and overall run suppression have ranked near the top of the league, but the offense has often relied too heavily on Julio Rodríguez. Bo Bichette directly addresses that issue.In 2025, he hit .311 with a .357 on-base percentage and a .483 slugging mark. He finished with 18 home runs, 94 RBI, 181 hits, and an .840 OPS. His production came from steady contact rather than streaky power, which matters in a park like T-Mobile.He hits line drives, uses the whole field, and avoids long dry spells. Placing that bat near Rodríguez would give Seattle Mariners a second dependable presence in the order, something the lineup has lacked in recent postseasons.Bo Bichette reached free agency at 27 after completing a three-year arbitration buyout with Toronto. He declined a qualifying offer in the mid-$20 million range, signaling he’s looking for a long-term deal.Seattle Mariners’ cleanest option is a straight signing:• 7-8 years• Estimated value between $180–220 million• Loss of a draft pick and international bonus pool money to TorontoThis places Bichette in the same contract tier as recent middle-infield stars and avoids trade complications.A more aggressive option would involve Toronto signing Bichette and immediately trading him:• Seattle receives Bichette on a pre-set long-term contract• Toronto receives prospects or young major-league talent instead of only draft compensationThis setup allows Toronto to recover more value while Seattle secures the player without a bidding war.Seattle Mariners already have J.P. Crawford at shortstop. That used to make Bichette a difficult fit.That changed when Bichette made it clear he is open to playing second base full-time.The alignment would be simple:• Crawford stays at short• Bichette plays secondSeattle would have a stable, productive middle infield with solid defense and strong contact at both spots. It also expands Bichette’s market and makes Seattle a practical landing spot.• A prime-age hitter who raises the lineup’s floor• Less offensive volatility in a park that punishes empty power• A clear signal that the team is pushing all-in during Rodríguez’s prime• A long-term deal at peak earning age• An everyday role without positional conflict• A roster built to contend behind elite pitching• Payroll flexibility instead of an eight-year commitment• Draft compensation if he leaves via free agency• The chance to add real talent back in a sign-and-trade scenarioToronto also avoids long-term risk after Bichette’s uneven 2024 season.The pattern is clear. When healthy, Bichette produces steady, high-end contact that holds up over a full season.Seattle has already improved offensively. Bichette would push that progress further.• Long contracts carry decline risk in the later years• Payroll flexibility tightens• Draft picks or prospects are lost• T-Mobile Park can suppress right-handed power• Expectations would be immediate• Reinvesting the savings doesn’t guarantee equal valueThese are normal tradeoffs for teams operating at the top of the market.In the short term, Seattle benefits the most. Adding a prime-age .300 hitter to a roster backed by elite pitching materially raises its chances over the next few seasons.Long term, the risk shifts. If Bichette declines in his early 30s, Toronto may look right for stepping away. Seattle would be paying for past production.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could be best landing spot for $33.6 million Toronto Blue Jays star; best Anthony Volpe replacement? That’s the cost of trying to win. Pairing Julio Rodríguez with Bo Bichette would raise the Mariners’ ceiling in a real way. Even if the contract hurts later, the move fits exactly what a serious contender is supposed to do now.","Bo bichette reached free agency at 27 after completing a three-year arbitration buyout with toronto.

Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake gameplay and modern upgrades



The world of Max Payne is all set to come back, and Remedy Entertainment, the original creator of the franchise, has confirmed that the highly anticipated Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake is now in full production. It is basically being developed in collaboration with Rockstar Games, which is the studio that published the originals and developed Max Payne 3.The upcoming remake essentially has the aim to bring the legendary story of tragedy and vengeance into the modern gaming era using Remedy's proprietary Northlight Engine. The following section takes a detailed look at all the known information about the Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake.While the project related to Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake has moved into full production, Remedy has not yet locked in a specific release date. Given the scale of a AAA remake and the developer's current pipeline, fans are speculating a launch window in late 2026 or 2027.Speaking of the game’s platforms, it is being developed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.The remake will combine Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne into a single game.The story will follow Max Payne, a DEA agent and former NYPD officer who becomes a fugitive after being framed for murder while seeking the people responsible for the death of his wife and daughter.Joining him as a dual protagonist is the contract killer Mona Sax. Their neo-noir romance remains the emotional core of the sequel, and fans are eager to see their complex relationship reimagined with modern performance capture and updated dialogue.The original Max Payne games defined the ""Bullet Time"" mechanic, and the remake is set to perfect it. You can expect the classic slow-motion gunplay and cinematic shoot-dodging to return; however, it will likely be coming back with the fluid physics and destructible environments seen in Remedy's more recent hits like Control and Alan Wake 2.Using the Northlight Engine, Remedy plans to overhaul the comic-book style cutscenes with in-game cinematics. They will likely be maintaining the iconic hard-boiled narration that made the original games a cult classic. This partnership between Remedy and Rockstar ensures that the remake will honor the original's legacy while delivering a wonderful experience.This was all you needed to know about Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake.",Max payne 1 & 2 remake is being developed by remedy entertainment and rockstar games.

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like celebrity net worth, paul heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

What does Josh Allen drive?

Inside Josh Allen’s SUPER SIZED Car Collection

Also Read:

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player, but his success off the field is just as visible - especially when it comes to what’s parked in his garage. From rugged trucks built for harsh Buffalo winters to high-end luxury and speed machines, Allen’s car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to NFL superstardom.Allen’s rise in the NFL has been matched by a major financial leap. After signing a six-year, $258 million contract extension with the Bills in 2021, the quarterback gained the freedom to indulge in his love for powerful vehicles. Yet, his choices suggest balance rather than excess. Many of Allen’s cars are built for utility and durability, fitting for a quarterback who plays in one of the league’s coldest markets.One of the cars of his garage is the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a full-size SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. With all-wheel drive and a spacious, luxury-filled interior, it’s a practical choice for Buffalo winters while still offering premium comfort.Allen has never hidden his appreciation for trucks, a nod to his upbringing in Firebaugh, California. His Ford F-150 Raptor, customized in an all-black finish, stands out as one of the most rugged vehicles he owns. Equipped with a powerful V8 engine and impressive ground clearance, the Raptor is built for tough terrain and poor weather, ideal for Western New York conditions.Adding to the SUV-heavy lineup is the Range Rover Sport, which blends performance, off-road ability, and luxury. With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force. Its V8 engine and plush interior make it a favorite among elite athletes, and Allen is no exception.For pure American muscle, Allen owns a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage. Sleek, fast, and unmistakably premium, the Vantage represents Allen’s taste for high-end performance cars. Capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph in just over three seconds, it’s a clear departure from his trucks and SUVs, offering a glimpse into his appreciation for refined speed.Josh Allen’s car collection isn’t about flash alone. It mirrors his journey grounded, powerful, and versatile.","Buffalo bills quarterback josh allen's car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to nfl superstardom.

Pain In Peak Hrs; 2,768 Vehicles Turned Away

BS-VI: Some caught unawares, others fume

NEW DELHI: Barricades snapped shut, whistles pierced the air, and confusion spread quickly across Delhi's borders Thursday morning as a rule barring non-Delhi, non-BS 6 vehicles came into force under GRAP Stage IV. Routine entry points rapidly turned into impromptu checkposts, catching many commuters off guard during peak hours.Traffic slowed to a crawl as police stopped vehicles bumper to bumper and scanned registration certificates, calling out ""BS 6?"", and scribbling details into handwritten registers. Drivers waited inside idling cars, watching the line inch forward, unsure whether they would be allowed to proceed or forced to turn back.Across 13 main borders from Kapashera to Badarpur, till 4pm, 2,768 vehicles were checked for compliance with BS 6 norms, of which 460 were turned back. Most vehicles were turned back at Najafgarh (175), Sarita Vihar/Kalindi Kunj (93), and Badarpur (33). Fewer vehicles were sent back at Narela (9) and Kapashera (8).At the Noida-Kalindi Kunj border, around 30 cars were turned back between 9.30am and 10.30am, officials said.Each U-turn created fresh snarls metres away from the barricades, and compounding congestion on already clogged stretches.Many commuters said the ban, announced on Tuesday, was enforced without warning. Dipak and his wife set out early from Pari Chowk in Greater Noida, hoping for a smooth drive towards Khatu Shyam for darshan, confidently following the route suggested by Google Maps. The journey was uneventful, until they reached Kalindi Kunj.A traffic policeman asked them to pull over, checked the vehicle details, and informed them that their car was BS V and not registered in Delhi. ""We genuinely didn't know about the rule,"" Dipak said. ""Google Maps showed this route, so we came. Now we have to go back 27km to Pari Chowk and start all over again. It's very disappointing.""They were not alone. Just a few lanes away, Brigadier Chawla faced a similar setback while travelling with his daughter, who had arrived from the US, to their hometown in Haryana.The situation eased after peak hours as traffic volumes fell. Enforcement continued till late into the evening.Traffic cops said it was tough ""stopping vehicles, checking them, and controlling traffic simultaneously"". Some 37 Prakhar vans and more than 500 traffic police personnel were deployed across major border points and key internal stretches. ""We managed to stop and check vehicles to some extent, while also helping people understand the rules,"" a traffic cop said. One person taking his father to dialysis had to be turned back, said a cop.As the day passed, and frustration coursed through the serpentine crawl of vehicles, commuters questioned the way the order was communicated. ""There are people who don't follow the news regularly. How are they supposed to know?"" asked Anil Kumar, a real estate professional. ""Why couldn't the transport department send automated SMS or WhatsApp alerts? Anyway, it's not like every car can be checked-there are just too many. "" Others admitted they were unsure about emission categories and struggled to understand whether their vehicles were BS IVor BS VI.Similar scenes unfolded at the Mayur Vihar and Ghazipur borders too. When Poonam's car was stopped at Mayur Vihar's Chilla border, her driver quickly stepped out, fumbling with documents. ""Arey, it's a petrol car,"" she told the policeman, visibly puzzled. When infor-med it still wasn't BS VI compliant, she paused and asked, ""Sorry, what does that mean?"" Eventually, she took a U-turn, adding, ""Maybe it's a good move. We'll take another car next time.""Others were confident until checks proved otherwise, and far less accepting. Praveen Kumar discovered his Camry met BS IV norms, not BS IV. ""I was sure it was compliant,"" he said, shaking his head in disbelief as he turned back.Advocate Vijay Mittal, who was stopped while heading to court, said he was aware of the order but did not realise his diesel BS IVcar would be barred. Ghaziabad resident Dr Pushkar Verma, travelling from Jaipur to report for duty at GTB Hospital, was also turned back. ""My car is 10 years old. I didn't think this would be an issue. I'll now have to take the Metro,"" he said.While cops turned back even those with genuine needs, questions lingered about the practicality of the exercise. At Kalindi Kunj, around 11 traffic personnel were deployed, while vehicle volumes during the morning peak can touch nearly 200,000, sources said. At Mayur Vihar, 7-9 were on duty, again vastly outnumbered by the flow of vehicles. With barricades and mid-way U-turns in place, congestion mounted rapidly.Transport expert Anil Chhikara called the ban ""premature"", and said enforcement would inevitably be compromised, given the poor manpower. ""Turning vehicles back at borders only leads to idling and higher emissions. Pollution in the NCR is a regional problem and treating it as only a Delhi issue won't help,"" he said.","2,768 vehicles were checked for compliance with bs 6 norms, of which 460 were turned back. Many commuters said the ban, announced on tuesday, was enforced without warning. Some 37 prakhar vans and more than 500 traffic police personnel deployed across major border points and key internal stretches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126067084,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1201517,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

As reported by Android Authority the update comes with Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 and it aligns with Imagination Technologies’ August driver release, introducing support for Vulkan 1.4 and enhanced compatibility.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Here’s how you can book an appointment online

Understanding face authentication: New Aadhaar verification method

Significance of face authentication in Aadhaar verification

Aadhaar privacy and consent: Ensuring secure identity verification





Face authentication has been legitimised by the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ), marking it as a significant change in handling online identities. This technology enables Aadhaar cardholders to authenticate their Aadhaar online by using their faces and matching them with their Aadhaar enrolment photo. This is facilitated by giving utmost importance to their consent, allowing them to manage their data whenever and however they feel like. Rules have been updated under Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP), making offline Aadhaar verification possible so that Aadhaar credentials are secured without reliance on online servers. With the launch of an updated Aadhaar application soon, operations involving events, hotel check-ins, deliveries, and access are expected to become easier and more privacy-oriented.Face recognition is a 1:1 consented method of verification. The facial image taken during the time of verification is matched with the Aadhar photo present in the UIDAI giant database at the time of enrolment. On successful matching, the identity of the individual is established. In contrast to fingerprinting and iris scanning, face recognition can be easily done even in scenarios where other biometric verification systems are not convenient or even feasible, for instance, at the time of entering an event, hotel, or gated community.Previously, face verification had very limited legal recognition and mainly only applied to governmental functions. Currently, the new set of rules by Aadhaar gives full legal recognition to face verification as a valid legal means of verification, along with OTP, biometric, and other secure means. It also significantly enhances offline verification of Aadhaar by allowing users to conveniently share digitally signed copies of credentials through trusted apps or QR codes without needing to directly access the UIDAI server.The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) organised a webinar on offline Aadhaar verification before the launch of the Aadhaar App. More than 250 people attended the webinar and learned about the functionality and uses of offline Aadhaar verification. UIDAI informed the participants how this process helps with the secure verification of identity without compromising identity protection by not requiring the Aadhaar cards themselves.This Aadhaar App will enable the user to share their own or their select family members’ Aadhaar information and provide advanced features for identity protection and updates by mobile or address. Face authentication proves the presence of the Aadhaar card holder at the verification location and satisfies the proof of presence criterion by confirming the Aadhaar card holder’s presence at the verification location. UIDAI officials state that face authentication doesn’t send any authentication information to the central server, and hence face authentication or face recognition technology is secure and superior to the previous methods.According to PIB , the key aspect highlighted in the new guidelines is that Aadhaar must only be used for specific reasons and must follow the consent mechanism. Individuals must now have the authority to accept or reject any Aadhaar-related verification, as well as the facility to disclose only certain information, including age or photo, but not the entire Aadhaar details. This, again, is in accordance with the DPDP Act, which strictly lays down the measures to avoid any potential abuse of personal data.","Face recognition is a 1:1 consented method of verification.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of ai startup valuations is unsustainable.
