NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.This notification comes barely a month before the scheduled rollout of Multi-Lane Free Flow (MLFF), or barrierless tolling, on around half a dozen stretches of the NH network.The notification was issued early this week. Work of MLFF is at an advanced stage at Manoharpur and Shahjahanpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, at Chorasi on the Surat-Vadodara stretch of NH-48 and at Gharonda on Delhi-Chandigarh highway. The changes in Central Motor Vehicles Rules are expected to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one skips paying toll when barrierless tolling is implemented.On MLFF stretches, there will be no physical barrier to stop vehicles for the collection of user fee. As per the notification, any “unpaid user fee” will be linked with the NOCs for vehicle related services and transactions. It defines unpaid user fee as the user fee payable by a vehicle for use of a section of NH, where the electronic toll collection system has recorded the passage of such vehicle but has not received the applicable user fee levied.Officials said that soon there will be a portal where people will be able to raise their complaints for settling disputes. “There will be enough scope for settlement before initiating action of blocking the NOC,” an official said.The road transport ministry has notified that failure to pay toll or user fees on a national highway (NH) will result in the denial of a no objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer, and issuance of a fitness certificate.

NEW DELHI: The government on Friday reportedly blocked access to over 200 illegal betting and gambling websites under the Online Gaming Act, which came into force in October 2025.“The Government of India today blocked 242 illegal betting and gambling website links. So far, more than 7,800 such platforms have been taken down, with enforcement action intensifying after the Online Gaming Act was passed,” government sources told news agency ANI.They added that the latest crackdown underscores the government’s commitment to protecting users, especially the youth, and to curbing the financial and social harm caused by illegal online betting and gambling platforms.In August last year, President Droupadi Murmu gave her assent to the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, after it was passed by both houses of Parliament, bringing it into force. The law seeks to promote e-sports and social online games while banning harmful money-based gaming, along with their promotion and related financial transactions.Players themselves will not be penalised for participating in money-based online games. Instead, action will be taken against service providers, advertisers, promoters and those financing such platforms.The online gaming rules came into effect on October 1 last year.","More than 7,800 such platforms have been taken down, government sources said.

Car mileage claims to get real as govt pushes AC-on testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/car-mileage-claims-to-get-real-as-govt-pushes-ac-on-testing/articleshow/126586190.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at providing more realistic and accurate mileage figures for cars, the road transport ministry has proposed mandatory testing of fuel efficiency with the air-conditioning (AC) system both switched on and off. The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs), manufactured or imported in India from October 1.Officials said subsequently, it will be mandatory for car manufacturers and importers to put the mileage for with and without AC on in the user manual of vehicles and on their website as well. So far car manufacturers have argued that as per European norms, only mileage without AC is taken into account. This is expected to improve transparency and help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions.The draft notification issued on Thursday said, “On and after October 1, 2026, all vehicles of category M1 (cars), manufactured or imported in India, shall be tested for measurement of fuel consumption with air-conditioning system in operation, as per AIS-213, as amended from time to time.” Officials said the move is intended to reflect real-world driving conditions, where AC usage significantly impacts mileage and energy consumption.At present, car manufacturers in India declare fuel-efficiency figures based on testing conducted without the AC running. Automakers have maintained that this practice aligns with prevailing European norms. However, govt officials noted that such figures often do not reflect actual on-road performance, leading to a gap between claimed and experienced mileage.AIS-213 lays down detailed procedures for measuring vehicle emissions and fuel consumption while the AC system is operational. The standard is designed to capture the additional fuel use and emissions generated due to AC load, which can substantially affect real-world efficiency and pollution levels.TOI has learnt that the ministry is also working on a broader framework to increase consumer awareness about vehicle emissions and in the near future, car owners may get exact information on this.","The proposed regulation will apply to all cars, including internal combustion engine (ice) vehicles and electric vehicles.

Kyle Tucker vs Shohei Ohtani: Real estate holdings

Kyle Tucker and Shohei Ohtani are both top-tier players, but their financial situations are quite different. Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the Chicago Cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals. In contrast, Ohtani has hit astronomical heights, securing a historic $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers and pulling in tens of millions more from endorsements.Fans may be curious about how Tucker’s earnings compare to a two-way sensation like Ohtani, whose appeal reaches both the U.S. and Japan. With everything from contracts to endorsements and real estate involved, the financial differences between these two athletes are fascinating.Shohei Ohtani has more than double the net worth as Kyle Tucker. Ohtani is expected to have a net worth of about $150 million by then. The calculation takes into account his $700 million contract with the Dodgers and annual endorsements that range from $40 million to $50 ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌million.On‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ the other hand, through his MLB salary and a fresh contract, Tucker's net worth is considered to be around $60 million.At the end of 2025, Tucker's career earnings are anticipated to reach $57.2 million, while his market value was figured at $195 million prior to signing his most recent ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌contract.Ohtani‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ signed an enormous 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December 2023, which was the largest in sports history at that moment. Under this deal, 97% of the amount is deferred: he will be paid $2 million annually from 2024 through 2033 and then $680 million will be paid out in $68 million installments from 2034 to 2043.The present worth of the deferred sum is approximately $460 million. Ohtani suggested this plan so that the Dodgers can have some flexibility with their salary cap. For 2026, his payroll salary stands at $28,216,944 along with cash earnings of $2 million.Tucker entered into a 4-year $240 million deal with the Dodgers, with an average of $60 million a year - thus becoming the second-highest baseball contract without any deferrals behind just Ohtani's $70 million AAV. The agreement possesses the right to opt out after the second and third years. Prior to this, Tucker earned $16.5 million on a one-year arbitration deal with the Cubs in 2025. His total career earnings have reached $57,175,737 by ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2025.Ohtani rakes in between $40 million and $50 million annually from endorsements, which makes him one of the top endorsers in the world.In 2025, his marketing earnings were projected to hit $100 million, outpacing LeBron James' $85 million. His appeal across cultures has drawn in brands from both Japan and the U.S., and merchandise sales broke records following his signing with the Dodgers.There's not much public info about Tucker's endorsements, but he does make money from brand deals, with baseball being his primary source of income. Recent sources haven't reported any specific investment details for Tucker.Ohtani bought a house in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for $7.85 million back in May 2024. He’s also part of a $240 million luxury housing project at the Mauna Kea Resort in Hawaii, where he snagged a $17 million property and acts as the celebrity spokesperson. Ohtani has committed to buying one of the 14 homes and intends to build a hitting and pitching facility for his preseason training.On the other hand, Tucker’s real estate investment isn’t publicly known.Also Read: Ryan Weathers says the New York Yankees were never on his radar until the Miami Marlins made the call","Tucker has been steadily increasing his earnings with his contracts from the chicago cubs, making millions through arbitration and brand deals.

What’s behind the delay in finalizing John Harbaugh’s Giants head coaching deal



The New York Giants are close to hiring John Harbaugh as their next head coach, but as of Thursday, nothing has been made official. Two days after the news first came out, the deal is still not finalized, and the exact timing of the announcement remains unclear.Harbaugh, a veteran NFL coach with a Super Bowl on his resume, is taking his time to review the opportunity. While the Giants are ready to bring him on board, he is making sure all the contract details are in order before signing. This methodical approach is not unusual for high-profile coaching moves, especially in the NFL’s fast-paced hiring market.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Harbaugh has been ""very methodical about doing due diligence"" in his discussions with the Giants. ""Talks continue between the Giants and John Harbaugh, and a deal could get done in the coming hours. But Harbaugh has been very methodical about doing due diligence, and nothing is finalized yet,"" Pelissero said.While both sides are aligned on the hiring, finalizing a contract involves ensuring all terms, including staff roles, compensation, and performance incentives, meet mutual expectations. SNY’s Connor Hughes also reported that the deal could be completed imminently, emphasizing that he does not foresee the agreement falling through.Harbaugh was reportedly interested in the Giants even before leaving the Baltimore Ravens, showing how much he wants the job. It seems both sides are committed, and the announcement is likely just around the corner.The Giants are looking to bring consistency to a franchise that has lacked success over the last several seasons. Having the experience that Harbaugh brings would undoubtedly make an instantaneous difference. His hiring would be huge for New York as it continues to try to compete among the elite.For now, the focus is on wrapping up the final details. Everything points to John Harbaugh becoming the next Giants head coach, with only a few contract matters left to finalize before the move is officially announced. Once completed, the Giants will officially enter a new era under John Harbaugh’s leadership.Also Read: Jason Dart's involvement hints at bigger plan as Giants host John Harbaugh for interview","The new york giants are close to hiring john harbaugh as their next head coach.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

‘I got kicked off the team’: How Travis Kelce turned one career-wrecking mistake into a $90 Million net worth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-got-kicked-off-the-team-how-travis-kelce-turned-one-career-wrecking-mistake-into-a-90-million-net-worth/articleshow/126569218.cms,"Travis Kelce net worth reflects NFL dominance, media ownership, and long-term financial discipline. (Image via Getty)

From suspension and rookie contracts to NFL extensions, endorsements, and media power

Why Travis Kelce’s net worth story still starts with a failed drug test

Travis Kelce did not build his wealth quietly. He also did not build it overnight. Long before the Taylor Swift headlines, Kelce was already one of the most financially successful non-quarterbacks in NFL history. His $90 million net worth did not come from luck or timing. It came from discipline learned the hard way.As of early 2026, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end has turned sustained on-field dominance into a diversified financial operation that spans NFL contracts, endorsements, media rights, and equity investments. This is not a story about celebrity proximity. It is a story about failure, leverage, and long-term planning.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025, a figure that aligns with reporting from Forbes and multiple contract databases. Kelce earned over $100 million in NFL contract value alone, before endorsements, bonuses, and media deals.Kelce entered the league as a third-round pick in 2013. His rookie contract paid $3.12 million over four years, including a signing bonus of just over $700,000.He missed nearly his entire rookie season due to injury, which delayed both production and leverage. That changed quickly.In 2016, Kelce signed a five-year, $46 million extension with $20 million guaranteed. In 2020, he added a four-year, $57.25 million extension with $28 million guaranteed. In April 2024, he signed a two-year, $34.25 million extension, including $17 million guaranteed.By the 2025 season, Kelce’s salary with Kansas City was estimated at $17 million, according to league contract figures. He accepted team-friendly structures to keep the roster competitive, a decision that helped produce three Super Bowl championships while preserving long-term brand value.Off the field, Kelce’s income now tilts heavily toward endorsements and media. Industry estimates place his endorsement earnings at $30 to $32 million annually, with partners including Nike, State Farm, Bud Light, Pfizer, McDonald’s, DirecTV, T-Mobile, and Casa Azul Tequila.The largest single shift came in 2024, when Kelce and his brother Jason secured a reported $100 million deal with Amazon ’s Wondery platform for their “New Heights” podcast. The deal transformed the show from a side project into a long-term media asset with advertising, licensing, and live event revenue.Kelce has also taken equity positions rather than one-time endorsement checks. In 2024, the Kelce brothers became major investors in Garage Beer Co., which reached a $200 million valuation following outside investment in 2025. He also holds stakes in multiple consumer, wellness, and lifestyle brands.Kelce’s financial discipline traces back to a moment that nearly ended his career before it began.In 2010, while at the University of Cincinnati, Kelce tested positive for marijuana and was suspended for the entire season. He lost his scholarship and was removed from the team. Reflecting on that period, Kelce later said, “I got kicked off the team.”The suspension forced Kelce into mandatory therapy and a full reset of his approach to football and life. It also triggered a position change to tight end full time, a move that unlocked his career.By his senior season in 2012, Kelce earned first-team All-Big East honors, setting the stage for his NFL entry. That early failure became the foundation for how he manages risk, money, and opportunity.Kelce’s business approach mirrors that lesson. He avoids reckless spending. He reinvests into longevity. His real estate choices emphasize privacy and appreciation. His lifestyle supports brand alignment rather than undermining it.Philanthropy is also structured. Through his Eighty-Seven & Running Foundation, Kelce funds education, mentoring, and community development initiatives in Cleveland and Kansas City. His contributions focus on sustained programs rather than one-time donations.Looking ahead, Kelce’s financial outlook remains strong regardless of retirement timing. His current contract runs through the 2025 season. His media ventures, equity positions, and endorsement appeal do not depend on weekly snap counts.Kelce acknowledged the physical toll of the NFL on the Jan. 6, 2026 episode of his “New Heights” podcast, saying, “There’s a lot of love for the game that’s still there and I don’t think I’ll ever lose that.” He also made clear that future decisions will be based on health and readiness, not financial necessity.Travis Kelce’s net worth did not come from fame. Fame amplified it. The wealth came from turning a near-career-ending mistake into structure, leverage, and ownership. That part of the story never changes.","According to celebrity net worth, travis kelce’s net worth is estimated at $90 million as of 2025. Kelce entered the league as a third-round pick in 2013.

Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments.Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Anthony Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income. His December 2025 fight vs Jake Paul was another big payday. This pushed his net worth toward $150 million.Outside the ring, Joshua has invested in real estate and business ventures through his company, 258 Group. These assets give him income beyond boxing. From 2016 to 2026, Anthony Joshua built his net worth with power and smart planning.Also Read: Kamaru Usman faces fans wrath after he releases video of Anthony Joshua’s emotional private call after tragic Nigeria crash","Anthony joshua is one of the richest boxers in the world.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen huang, ceo of $3 trillion chipmaker nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints

Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story.He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the worth of his stake in Beast Industries and other things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is in stocks and not cash.He talked about common ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people think he is a billionaire, but that is because they mix up his net worth with his available cash. He said that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold or converted, which he has decided not to do.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy basic things like breakfast. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy donaldson, widely known as mrbeast, is one of the most well-known people on youtube.

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images.

Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement stifling, while staff question his leadership for Meta's AI ambitions. A recent strategy clash highlighted differing priorities, with Wang pushing for cutting-edge AI over immediate product integration.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr wang, meta's highest-paid employee, finds mark zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani Announces New Enforcement Actions Against Predatory Delivery Apps

A broader compliance blitz





New York City has escalated its confrontation with delivery app companies, filing a lawsuit against one operator it accuses of widespread wage theft while simultaneously warning more than 60 platforms that tougher worker protections will be enforced from late January. The moves, announced by Mayor Zohran Mamdani and senior city officials, mark the most aggressive phase yet of the administration’s push to reshape conditions for the city’s delivery workforce.On Thursday, the administration sent formal notices to more than 60 delivery app companies, including DoorDash, Instacart and Uber , warning them to comply with amendments to New York City’s Delivery Worker Laws by 26 January 2026.“Amendments to the Delivery Worker Laws go into effect on Jan. 26, 2026,” wrote Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Sam Levine in the letters. “We expect your company to be in full compliance on that date… We will be closely monitoring for violations of law and will take follow-up action as warranted.”The changes, passed by the City Council last year, extend the city’s minimum pay standard to grocery delivery apps such as Instacart, bringing them into line with restaurant delivery platforms.They also give workers the right to set maximum delivery distances, a provision designed to reduce pressure on couriers to accept long trips for fear of losing access to work.Mayor Mamdani underlined the administration’s intent at a press conference held at the Worker’s Justice Project headquarters in Williamsburg, home to Los Deliveristas Unidos, the delivery worker organisation that has pushed for expanded labour protections.“No longer will we tolerate corporate mistreatment of workers across these five boroughs,” Mamdani said. “Which is why we have sent warning letters to 60 app companies warning them that new laws protecting workers will take effect on Jan. 26 of this year, and that those laws will be enforced.”Levine, a former official in the Biden administration’s Federal Trade Commission, said the letters were meant to leave no ambiguity about the city’s intentions. “I want these companies to start following the law,” he told Streetsblog. “My hope is that they realize they are in a new era and start coming into compliance, and that’s why we sent those letters.”Under the amended laws, companies face fines, lawsuits and even licence revocation if they fail to comply. The rules also require platforms to offer customers the option to tip at checkout rather than only after delivery, and to provide workers with itemised pay statements explaining how earnings are calculated.Alongside the warning letters, the city filed a case in New York State Supreme Court against Motoclick, a restaurant-facing delivery app it accuses of egregious violations of the Delivery Worker Laws. According to the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Motoclick ignored the city’s minimum pay rate and directly deducted money from workers’ earnings, including charging a $10 fee for cancelled orders and docking the full cost of refunded meals.“Motoclick and its CEO tricked New Yorkers into working for their platform with false promises and then stole their tips and earnings – sometimes even driving workers into debt,” said Levine. “We are seeking to shutdown this company and other predatory apps should be on notice. If you scam your workers, we will hold you and your executives accountable.”The department estimates that Motoclick and its chief executive, Juan Pablo Salinas Salek, owe workers millions of dollars in stolen pay and damages, and is seeking to shut the company down entirely.Mamdani framed the lawsuit as part of a broader shift in city policy. “Deliveristas make millions of New Yorkers’ day-to-day lives easier only for their own to be difficult. Today, however, marks the end of a chapter of thankless exploitation,” he said. “Our Department of Consumer and Worker Protection is already cracking down on everything from baseless violations of the law to deceptive tricks that hurt our delivery workers, and showing what a government that puts working people first can accomplish every day. ”Deputy Mayor for Economic Justice Julie Su described the case as a warning shot to the wider industry. “Today’s lawsuit against Motoclick is not just an action against one company, it’s a warning to every app-based company from this Administration. You cannot treat workers like they are expendable and get away with it. We will seek full back pay and damages. We will seek full accountability.”The enforcement push comes amid a broader fight over tipping practices. A recent report by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found that delivery workers have lost as much as $550 million in tips since Uber and DoorDash moved the tipping option to after checkout. According to the report, the average tip fell from more than $3 to less than $1 after the change, while platforms that kept tipping at checkout, such as Grubhub, did not see a comparable decline.DoorDash and Uber Eats have sued the city over the new tipping law, arguing that it violates their free speech rights and will make deliveries more expensive for customers. A DoorDash spokesperson said the company’s position remained unchanged: “Despite what DCWP Commissioner Levine thinks, our goal remains the same: to empower local economies and connect New Yorkers with the restaurants and businesses they love. [DoorDash workers] continue to earn fairly on our platform and customers continue to have the ability to tip post-checkout. ”Other companies struck a more conciliatory tone. Wonder, which now owns Grubhub, Seamless and Relay, confirmed it had received the mayor’s letter and said it would work with the administration. “Delivery drivers provide an essential service to millions of New Yorkers, and we look forward to partnering with the Mayor’s office on smart policy that makes delivery work better for everyone,” a spokesperson said.Levine said the Motoclick lawsuit and the warning letters were part of a wider compliance blitz tied to several local laws taking effect on 26 January. These include Local Laws 107 and 108 on tipping protections, Local Law 113 on pay transparency, and Local Laws 123 and 124 expanding minimum pay coverage, payment timelines and bathroom access for delivery workers.As the deadline approaches, the administration has made clear that enforcement will not be symbolic. With litigation already under way and dozens of companies on notice, New York is signalling that the next phase of its delivery worker reforms will be driven not by negotiation, but by penalties, court action and, if necessary, shutdowns.","Nyc’s new delivery worker law takes effect january 26, 2026, as zohran mamdani sues one app and warns 60 others of shutdowns.

LONDON: The British government has watered down plans for mandatory digital identification cards, a contentious idea it had touted as a way to help control immigration.It's the latest policy U-turn by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's embattled center-left government, which is under fire from both opposition politicians and governing Labour Party lawmakers.Officials confirmed Wednesday that it won't be compulsory for citizens and residents to show a digital ID card in order to get a job, ditching a key plank of the policy announced in September.""The digital ID could be one way you prove your eligibility to work,"" Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC, alongside other documents such as biometric passports.The government said detailed plans for digital ID cards will be ""set out following a full public consultation which will launch shortly.""Starmer announced in September that ""you will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""He said the plan would help reduce unauthorized immigration by making it harder for people to work in the underground economy. He said it would also make it simpler for people to access health care, welfare, child care and other public services.He faced an immediate backlash, with polls suggesting support for digital ID plummeted after Starmer backed the idea.Britain has not had compulsory identity cards for ordinary citizens since shortly after World War II, and the idea has long been contentious. Civil rights campaigners argue it infringes personal liberty and puts people's information at risk.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair tried to introduce biometric ID cards two decades ago as a way of fighting terrorism and fraud, but the plan was abandoned after strong opposition from the public and Parliament.After the latest policy shift, opposition Conservative Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake said that ""Labour's only consistent policy is retreat.""
