Donald Trump's India tariff impact: Major American brands in India, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple, are faced with boycott demands as corporate leaders and supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi respond to US tariffs. India's vast population makes it a crucial market for American companies.The significance of India as a market is evident through various examples: WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has its largest user base in India, whilst Domino's operates more outlets there than any other food chain. American beverage giants Pepsi and Coca-Cola maintain a strong retail presence, whilst Apple stores and Starbucks outlets continue to attract substantial customer interest.The implementation of a 50% tariff on Indian goods by Donald Trump has strained diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Washington, leading to widespread social media campaigns and public calls to support local alternatives over American products. Whilst immediate impact on sales remains unclear, there is increasing momentum behind the movement to boycott US goods in favour of domestic options, according to a Reuters report.Manish Chowdhary, who co-founded Wow Skin Science in India, shared a video on LinkedIn advocating support for domestic farmers and startups. He emphasised the importance of elevating ""Made in India"" products to international recognition, citing South Korea's success in food and beauty sectors.""We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don't own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,"" he said.DriveU's CEO, Rahm Shastry, expressed on LinkedIn his vision for India to develop its own alternatives to major social media and tech platforms: ""India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB -- like China has.""W hilst Indian retail organisations successfully compete with international brands such as Starbucks in the local market, achieving global expansion remains difficult.In contrast, Indian technology service companies have established a strong international presence, with organisations like TCS and Infosys delivering software solutions to clients across the globe.During a Sunday gathering in Bengaluru, PM Modi issued a ""special appeal"" for self-reliance, stating that whilst Indian technology firms create products globally, ""now is the time for us to give more priority to India's needs.""Amidst ongoing anti-American demonstrations, Tesla inaugurated its second Indian showroom in New Delhi on Monday, with representatives from both the Indian commerce ministry and US embassy in attendance.","Major american brands in india, including mcdonald's, coca-cola, amazon and apple, are faced with boycott demands.

India Makes Stunning Russia Oil Move In Response To Trump Sanctions Threat | Details

EU sanctions impact on Nayara Energy

Sanctions fallout

History of Nayara Energy

Nayara Energy’s focus on domestic market

Nayara Energy, the Russia-backed Indian refinery, is facing a perfect storm - hit by European Union sanctions, the company currently faces multiple challenges! These include disrupted global shipping, domestic regulatory constraints, changes in leadership and concerns regarding digital infrastructure.For Nayara Energy, which is responsible for approximately 8% of India's refining capacity and 7% of its retail fuel station network, these difficulties are testing both the company's adaptability and its future planning.Nayara Energy operates India's second-largest private refinery, alongside its oil storage terminal, port facilities, infrastructure and a network exceeding 6,000 petrol stations, according to an ET report.Its ambitious growth trajectory now faces significant uncertainty.On July 18, the EU implemented its 18th sanctions package against Russia, with restrictions on fuel imports refined from Russian crude, reducing the Russian oil price cap to $47.6 per barrel from $60 and addressing the shadow fleet involved in transportation.The price cap becomes effective September 3. Additionally, US President Donald Trump has imposed 50% duties on Indian imports, alleging India's support for Moscow's Ukrainian campaign through oil purchases.Also Read | Donald Trump tariffs: How much will India’s fuel bill rise if it stops Russian crude oil imports & where would it buy from? Explained Despite avoiding direct sanctions, Nayara's substantial Russian ownership has resulted in progressive complications.Shortly after the latest EU sanctions were implemented, Alessandro Des Dorides stepped down as Nayara Energy's chief executive, with Sergey Denisov, a company veteran since 2017, taking the helm.On July 28, Nayara Energy faced a significant challenge when Microsoft blocked their access to data, tools and products, despite having valid paid licences. Although services were restored following legal action by Nayara, the incident highlighted the gravity of their situation.A trader with knowledge of the situation was quoted as saying, ""Nayara's troubles have just begun. It is not only barred from exporting refined products to Europe, but fearing penalties, shipping companies are pulling back from transporting its products. Insurers and trade finance providers are wary."" The source indicated this has limited the company's ability to service export markets in Europe, Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.According to Care Ratings' July assessment, exports represented 25-30% of Nayara's total revenue, with domestic Indian sales accounting for the remainder. Despite minimal direct EU exports, with most international sales occurring through traders serving various markets, Nayara is actively seeking alternative payment arrangements as EU sanctions loom. Reports suggest the company is looking to partner with a local bank to handle crude oil import payments and receive funds for refined fuel exports.Under the weight of sanctions, Rosneft has been unable to transfer profits from Nayara Energy in recent years. According to informed sources, this inability to move earnings from the company is considered a primary factor in its consideration to divest the Indian operation.The recent wave of sanctions has created additional obstacles to this process. Discussions have occurred with Indian business groups, with valuations exceeding $20 billion.In a parallel development, UCP Investment Group, a prominent Russian financial investment organisation, seeks to dispose of its Nayara Energy holding for more than $5 billion. This follows Trafigura's divestment of its 24.5% ownership to Hara Capital Sarl, a fully-owned subsidiary of Italian energy investment company Mareterra Group Holding, in January 2023. Industry experts suggest that sanctions could reduce Nayara's market value, potentially making it an appealing prospect for international investors.In August 2017, following the acquisition of Essar Oil's 20-mtpa Vadinar refinery (Gujarat) by a Rosneft-led consortium, the entity was rebranded as Nayara Energy. The name combines 'Naya' (Hindi for new) and 'Era', reflecting the shareholders' aspirations for the asset's future development.The establishment of Nayara coincided with significant reforms in India's petroleum sector, where the government's deregulation of fuel retail prices created equal opportunities for private retailers like Nayara to expand their network, according to the ET report.This liberalisation caused considerable anxiety among state-operated oil marketing companies, which had previously maintained a stronghold over fuel retailing. Their primary concern was the potential loss of market share to private entities such as Nayara and Reliance Industries, the report said.Also Read | India-US trade deal: With Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs looming, India reviews market access offers for US; three-pronged strategy to protect exporters Nayara has seen steady growth until it encountered difficulties from sanctions imposed by the United States and EU, aimed at targeting Russia following its Ukraine war. The company's oil and energy revenue has become particularly vulnerable.The acquisition of the Essar facility by Russia's state energy corporation and an international investor consortium comprising Trafigura and UCP Investment Group was valued at $12.9 billion. This represented Rosneft's most substantial overseas investment in India's refining industry, securing access to one of the world's rapidly expanding markets.Nayara Energy has been compelled to focus on domestic markets due to international constraints. Recently, the company approached government-owned refineries, proposing to sell them its export-designated petrol and diesel quantities to avoid stockpiling.The shift towards domestic sales provides temporary respite but affects profitability. European markets traditionally yielded higher returns compared to domestic sales. Competition within India, particularly from government-owned fuel retailers, restricts pricing autonomy and adaptability.Also Read | Explainer: Donald Trump’s 50% tariffs - will India budge on Russia crude oil trade? This situation emerged precisely when Nayara Energy was preparing for substantial expansion. The company had declared intentions to invest more than ₹70,000 crore in various sectors including petrochemicals, ethanol production facilities and retail infrastructure development. Since August 2017, it had already invested over ₹14,000 crore in Indian projects, encompassing refinery upgrades, a petrochemical facility and infrastructure developments.The sanctions now threaten to disrupt technical assistance from European technology providers, essential for refinery operations. The critical consideration remains whether Nayara can maintain its diversification strategy while its primary refining-export operations face challenges under western restrictions.","Nayara energy is responsible for approximately 8% of india's refining capacity and 7% of its retail fuel station network.

YouTuber behind viral predator stings loses Roblox account overnight

Roblox says “good intentions” don’t override safety rules

Schlep takes his fight to Senator Ted Cruz

A viral flashpoint for gaming, safety, and free speech

Schlep, a YouTuber who built his online following by hunting alleged “predators” inside Roblox, is now in the headlines for a very different reason. The 22-year-old creator’s Roblox account has been terminated, and he says the gaming giant has sent him a cease and desist letter threatening possible legal action.On August 10, 2025, Schlep took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal that his Roblox account was gone. Alongside the announcement, he posted screenshots of what he says is a cease and desist notice from Roblox Corporation accusing him of “unauthorized and harmful activities” on the platform.The letter accused him of violating Roblox’s rules by engaging in staged child-endangerment chats, posting identifiable information, and moving conversations off-platform.Schlep’s videos, popular on YouTube, often showed him posing as minors to bait adults attempting inappropriate contact. He claims his work has helped lead to six arrests across the United States. Roblox, however, said the methods crossed the line, arguing they interfered with official safety measures.In the notice, Roblox reportedly acknowledged that Schlep’s stated goal was protecting children. However, the company argued that his methods disrupted its own moderation and safety systems, potentially increasing risk for players.The letter stated that failing to report suspicious activity through official Roblox channels was a violation, one that, in the company’s view, exposed users to harm. The termination, it said, was in line with its community standards, and it warned that further violations could lead to legal action.Less than 24 hours later, Schlep’s story took another turn. On August 11, he tagged U.S. Senator Ted Cruz in a public post, asking for a conversation about Roblox and child safety.In the message, Schlep identified himself as a Texas resident and said he was a victim of grooming on Roblox as a child.He argued that the platform’s negligence toward protecting young players had already been the subject of lawsuits in Texas. He also claimed that despite his own efforts leading to multiple arrests, Roblox targeted him instead of addressing the root problem.Schlep’s situation has become one of the most talked-about Roblox controversies of the year. His fans see a whistleblower punished for protecting kids; Roblox sees a rogue actor bypassing safety systems.For now, his account remains closed, the legal warning stands, and the community is left wondering whether this is the end of his Roblox career — or the start of an even bigger fight.

Why Non-Nod-Krai Units Matter

What This Could Mean for Gameplay

Encourage mixed-region teams instead of mono-Nod-Krai squads.

Increase the importance of stat-optimized supports.

Boost overall reaction-based damage for more dynamic playstyles.

The Genshin Impact 6.0 hype train is already off the rails, and it’s not even here yet. The upcoming Nod-Krai region isn’t just bringing jaw-dropping landscapes and fresh characters like Flins, Lauma, and Aino. Leaks are hinting at a new resonance buff that could completely shake up team-building strategies. And no, you don’t even need a full Nod-Krai squad to trigger it. Here’s the tea.According to trusted community sources, Nod-Krai characters will have a unique resonance effect that activates when non-Nod-Krai characters use their Elemental Skill or Burst. Once triggered, this buff increases Lunar Reaction damage for all party members for up to 20 seconds, with a rumored boost reaching 36% depending on team stats.If the leak is accurate, the resonance buff won’t be a flat bonus—it’ll scale differently based on element:This means stat-focused builds could heavily influence how powerful the buff becomes in combat.Interestingly, the buff can only be triggered by characters from other nations, making strong synergy with existing units possible. Supports like Yelan, Furina, Nahida, Kazuha, and Sucrose could become highly valuable in Nod-Krai teams.Players are already speculating optimal comps for upcoming characters like Lauma, Flins, and Aino—all expected to debut in 6.0.If the leaks hold true, the Nod-Krai resonance could:It’s a potential shift in how players approach team building, pushing for creative synergy between old favorites and new Nod-Krai arrivals.As always, this is unverified information. HoYoverse could tweak or entirely scrap the mechanic before release. Still, if implemented, the Nod-Krai resonance buff could be one of the most impactful meta changes in recent updates, especially for reaction-heavy teams.

Australian Court rules against the tech giant's practices



What was the entire conflict about?



“The Epic Games Store and Fortnite will come to iOS in Australia!”

How did the tech giants respond to the ruling?



“strongly disagrees”

Fortnite and Epic Games Store are finally making their return to iOS devices in Australia. Such a major shift follows the partial legal victory of Epic Games against tech giants Apple and Google. The Australian court ruling has paved the way for the popular game Fortnite after its five-year absence from iOS devices. As per the Federal Court’s ruling, Apple and Google engaged in anti-competitive behaviour.Here is all you need to know about the ruling that can lead to major changes in how the digital marketplaces operate within Australia.The Federal court has finally offered a partial win for Epic Games this week. Justice Jonathan Bench found that both Apple and Google misused their market power. They violated Australian Competition laws. They restricted the alternative payment system and app distribution methods. Reportedly, as ruled by the judge, the giants substantially lessened competition.Quite specifically, the Australian court condemned the practices that forced the developers to use the payment systems of tech giants.It included banning the sideloading of applications on iOS and further restricting alternative payment methods. While Epic Games' claim of the unconscionable conduct was rejected, the Apple Google anti-competitive behavior core finding stood firm. Such legal validation directly enabled the return of Epic Games to the iOS platform.The conflict, as per reports, ignited in August 2020, when Epic Games introduced a direct payment system in Fortnite. Epic Games direct payment system bypassed the 30% commission of Apple, thereby leading to Fortnite being removed from the App Store. Even Google followed the same suit on the Play Store. While Fortnite did return to the Android Play Store, the iOS ban continued to persist.Epic Games now took to X to confirm the end of their exile. As per the Epic Games court ruling post,2000+ pages of findings by the court were also framed by the developer as a clear win for consumers and developers, breaking down the restrictive barriers. iOS Fortnite availability though has not been confirmed yet.The decision of the court to not just allow Fortnite return to iOS Australia but also open up the Epic Games Store to launch on Apple devices, is a huge win. It could encourage competition. Epic Games Store Australian return will also offer all more choices beyond Google Play and Apple’s App Store.As per reports, Apple and Google both expressed their disagreement with the key rulings. While Apple used words likewith parts of the decision, they did welcome certain Epic Games claims. Google, on the other hand, went ahead to contest the court’s characterization of billing policies and the partnerships. Despite all, the court findings continue to stand.Some potential appeals made to the Federal Court full bench are an option for now, for the tech giants. Lawyers, too, would return separately to court to determine the potential compensation that Epic Games might be owed. As for the Australian iOS users, immediate outcomes remain clear—Epic Games Store and Fortnite are coming back.","Australian court rules against the tech giant's practices.

Rockstar Games ’ Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) remains one of the most anticipated video game releases globally. Earlier in 2025, Rockstar unveiled the game’s second official trailer alongside a confirmed release date of May 26, 2026. This announcement thrilled fans but also raised cautious optimism due to Rockstar’s reputation for pushing back major game launches. Originally planned for 2025, questions linger about whether this new date will hold, especially considering the high expectations for innovative gameplay and cutting-edge graphics.The hype around GTA 6 continues to build as Rockstar reveals more details and approaches its projected 2026 release. While fans eagerly await the game, the cautious optimism around timing and pricing reflects the realities of AAA game development in today’s market.Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again, but patience will be key as the release date approaches.Rockstar Games is known for its meticulous development process. The company prioritizes delivering polished, expansive gaming experiences over strict adherence to release schedules. This approach often leads to delays, as seen with previous hits like Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 5. These delays, while frustrating for fans, usually result in critically acclaimed, technically impressive games that push the boundaries of open-world design and storytelling innovation, enhancing player immersion and long-term engagement.Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, confirmed in their most recent earnings report that GTA 6 is still on track for its May 26, 2026 launch. This is positive news amid speculation about possible delays, fueled by Rockstar’s history of postponing flagship titles.However, previous earnings calls from Take-Two indicated a 2025 release, which didn’t come to fruition, so this confirmation remains tentative. Fans should remain cautiously hopeful but prepared for potential shifts in the timeline.One major uncertainty surrounding GTA 6 is its pricing structure. With the gaming industry trending towards higher launch prices—Nintendo has already introduced $80 titles—there’s widespread speculation that Take-Two might follow suit. Given GTA 6’s reportedly massive budget and scale, an $80 price tag or higher is plausible, as reported.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told Variety that their goal is to “deliver more value than what we charge.” This suggests the company plans to justify premium pricing through quality content and added value, possibly with deluxe editions and special bonuses. Unofficial leaks hint at regional standard edition prices ranging from Rs 5,999 in India to $70 in the US, while deluxe editions could cost up to $125 in some markets.Rockstar promises GTA 6 will significantly expand upon the series’ signature open-world crime gameplay. The new installment follows protagonists Jason and Lucia in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired storyline, set primarily in Leonida—a fictional state modeled after Florida, with Vice City at its core.The game will feature:Take-Two’s Q2 2025 earnings report showcased robust performance, with net bookings reaching $1.42 billion and total revenue of $1.5 billion, driven by existing franchises like NBA 2K25 and GTA Online. This strong financial footing allows Take-Two to invest heavily in GTA 6’s development and marketing.This investment underscores the company’s commitment to making GTA 6 a groundbreaking release that meets fan expectations for quality and innovation. Furthermore, successful launch and reception of GTA 6 could redefine market standards for AAA open-world titles moving forward.The company has also raised its full-year net bookings projection for fiscal 2026 to between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion, reflecting confidence that GTA 6, alongside other titles like Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, will drive substantial sales. While GTA 6’s confirmed release date offers hope, fans should remain prepared for potential delays, given Rockstar’s history. Pricing will likely reflect recent industry trends toward premium game costs, but Take-Two’s promise of delivering value could soften that impact.With a bigger world, innovative gameplay, and a compelling dual-protagonist story, GTA 6 promises to be a milestone in open-world gaming. Players can expect a richly detailed experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre.","Grand theft auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again, but patience will be key as the release date approaches.

Apple’s next iPhone release, the iPhone 17 series , could mark a notable shift—for the first time in years, consumers may see higher prices at launch. Analyst Jeff Pu from GF Securities reports that US tariffs on devices from China and India could push prices up by $50 to $100 compared to the iPhone 16 models. At the same time, Apple may increase the base storage on the Pro model to 256GB, adding more value behind the higher price. As September approaches, buyers and analysts are watching closely. The coming decisions will influence not only budgets but also the broader discussion around trade, manufacturing, and consumer expectations in the tech world.According to MacRumors, market projections suggest that at least some iPhone 17 models will cost between $50 and $100 more than their predecessors. This would be the first price increase for the Pro model since the iPhone X in 2017.One way Apple may lessen the sting is by increasing the minimum storage on the Pro model from 128GB to 256GB. This aligns with existing practices and can help justify a higher base price with a tangible upgrade.According to Jeff Pu, new US tariffs on products imported from iPhone assembly hubs like China and India are expected to raise production costs. While imports from China carry a 20% tariff, devices made in India are currently exempt. However, since Apple now brings most of its US-sold iPhones from India, these cost pressures still affect pricing decisions. The unpredictable nature of US trade policy adds another layer of uncertainty to Apple’s cost structure.Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025. Pre-orders may begin on September 12, with shipments and retail availability starting September 19.Potential starting prices based on recent leaks:According to Business Insider, Apple’s Q3 earnings report revealed $94 billion in revenue, supported by strong iPhone sales. Despite this, the company incurred $800 million in tariff costs, expected to rise to $1.1 billion next quarter. Analysts warn that continued cost challenges may force Apple to raise prices more broadly, not just in the US, potentially affecting global retail pricing strategies.","Apple iphone 17 series 'likely' to launch with higher prices; new leak claims.

Improve your creativity with these 7 lessons from Steve Jobs







Connecting the dots



Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

Stay hungry, stay foolish



Simplify relentlessly



Say no to a thousand things



Start with human experience



Think different with deep focus



Build teams that raise the bar

Steve Jobs, celebrated for his groundbreaking innovations, believed creativity thrives through intentional habits and mindsets. From his famous “connecting the dots” philosophy to maintaining a beginner’s mindset and relentlessly simplifying ideas, Jobs shared key principles for unlocking creative potential. He stressed the importance of focused effort, saying no to distractions, designing with empathy , and building high-performing teams . Embracing these seven tips can help you nurture creativity, spark innovation, and achieve meaningful breakthroughs in your personal and professional life.In the 2005 Stanford Commencement Address, Steve Jobs shared his personal story about “connecting the dots,” highlighting a key aspect of creativity. He explained that creativity often comes from linking ideas across different fields. Jobs encouraged embracing diverse experiences—whether in arts, technology, calligraphy, or history—and reflecting on them regularly. The wider your range of influences, the greater your ability to combine seemingly unrelated concepts in new and surprising ways, sparking fresh insights and innovative solutions.Maintaining a beginner’s mindset is key to sustaining creativity. Jobs famously urged people to remain curious and open to learning, avoiding complacency. This means continually challenging yourself with new projects, taking smart risks, and engaging in learning sprints—short bursts of intense focus on acquiring new skills or knowledge. This hunger and willingness to experiment keeps your mind agile and open to breakthrough ideas.One hallmark of Jobs’s work was simplicity. He believed stripping ideas down to their essential core made them clearer and more powerful. When something feels complicated or hard to explain, it usually needs refinement. Focus on clarity by removing unnecessary features or distractions, so the core concept shines. Simplicity not only enhances understanding but also makes your ideas feel inevitable and compelling.Focus is a vital ingredient of creativity. Jobs emphasized the importance of saying “no” to many distractions and opportunities to protect your energy and time. Instead of spreading yourself thin, channel your efforts into one or two key projects that really matter. By concentrating deeply on a few priorities, the quality and impact of your work improve significantly.Creative ideas become truly impactful when they address real human needs and emotions. Jobs urged designing backward from the user’s perspective, considering how a person feels and what they want to do rather than just focusing on technical specs or checklists. Obsessing over the end-to-end experience helps you create solutions that resonate deeply with people and stand out.Originality requires questioning the status quo and carving out distraction-free time to think deeply. Jobs believed in breaking away from default rules and assumptions to explore bold hypotheses. Solitude and concentrated effort are crucial to developing ideas that are not only innovative but also practical enough to implement. Setting aside blocks of focused work allows your creativity to flourish without interruption.Creativity rarely happens in isolation. Jobs stressed the power of collaboration, saying great things are achieved by teams. Surround yourself with talented people who share high standards and foster an environment of psychological safety where everyone can contribute ideas freely. A strong team challenges and supports each other, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible together.Incorporating these seven principles from Steve Jobs into your daily routine can help you nurture creativity and produce innovative work. By connecting diverse ideas, staying curious, simplifying concepts, focusing on what truly matters, prioritizing human experience, dedicating time for deep thinking, and collaborating with high-caliber teams, you set the stage for creative breakthroughs that can change the world.","Steve jobs believed creativity thrives through intentional habits and mindsets.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

UAE: Why electric vehicle insurance costs are now 72% higher than petrol cars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-why-electric-vehicle-insurance-costs-are-now-72-higher-than-petrol-cars/articleshow/123257254.cms,"Electric vehicles in the UAE face 72% higher insurance costs due to expensive battery repairs, limited service centers, and flood-related claims/Representative Image

EV adoption and infrastructure expansion





Used EV market and battery confidence support market expansion





Industry optimism and long-term market outlook









Electric vehicles (EVs) in the UAE are gaining significant traction, but their insurance premiums remain substantially higher than those of petrol cars averaging 72% more. This cost disparity, driven by repair complexities and flood related damages, presents challenges in a rapidly expanding EV market backed by rising sales, infrastructure development, and growing consumer interest.The average annual insurance premium for electric vehicles in the UAE has reached approximately AED 4,992, compared to AED 2,895 for petrol or diesel cars. This 72% gap is primarily due to higher repair costs, particularly for specialised components like batteries, which often require international sourcing and limited local repair expertise.Speaking to, Hitesh Motwani, deputy CEO of insurancemarket.ae, explained that specialised components such as EV batteries often require international shipping, and the limited number of repair centres in the UAE is driving up claim expenses.The April 2024 floods exacerbated these issues, causing widespread battery failures and adding further pressure on insurers. As the EV sector matures, insurance pricing is expected to evolve, with data-driven models that consider factors like battery condition, charging habits, and vehicle technology. Insurers are also beginning to work more closely with authorised repair networks to streamline claims and reduce long-term costs.The UAE has emerged as a regional leader in EV adoption, with electric vehicles accounting for 13% of all new car sales in 2023 up from just 0.7% in 2021. This represents between 28,000 and 33,000 new EVs, including plug-in hybrids, entering the market within a single year.A growing range of affordable electric vehicle models and rapid expansion of charging infrastructure are key drivers behind the UAE’s rising EV adoption. Market data shows a clear shift in consumer preference, supported by improved accessibility, enhanced battery technology, and ongoing government and private sector investments in clean mobility.Notably, Abu Dhabi’s joint venture between Adnoc and Taqa aims to install 70,000 EV chargers by 2030. Battery advancements now enable many EVs to travel over 400km on a single charge, with some premium models exceeding 600km, helping address range anxiety.The UAE’s used EV market is also growing rapidly, bolstered by increased supply, improved affordability, and wider consumer acceptance. Online platforms are reporting a rise in demand for pre-owned electric vehicles, with a diverse range of options including both budget friendly Chinese brands and premium European models.Buyers are now more focused on battery health, warranty status, and charging compatibility. Longterm battery warranties, typically covering up 8 to 10 years, have helped ease concerns about degradation. New battery certification tools are also boosting transparency and buyer confidence in the secondary market.Despite current challenges, industry experts view high insurance premiums as a temporary issue. Greater availability of vehicle data and closer collaboration between insurers, regulators, and manufacturers are expected to help stabilise costs over time.Electric vehicle manufacturers continue to focus on innovation in range, design, and user experience. For instance, premium models now offer certified driving ranges above 600km, with real world usability often between 500 to 550km per charge.As charging infrastructure expands and resale values stabilise, luxury EVs like the Porsche Taycan retain 80 to 82% of value after three years electric vehicle ownership is becoming increasingly viable. These developments align with the UAE government’s goal of having 50% of vehicles on the road be electric by 2050.","Electric vehicles in the uae face 72% higher insurance costs due to expensive battery repairs, limited service centers, and flood-related claims.

Enforcement trends







Government and authority messages:





The United Arab Emirates has recently intensified its enforcement of laws against negative, abusive, and defamatory comments on social media platforms, signaling a strict legal environment for online speech. Authorities across the UAE, including police in Sharjah and Dubai, have issued stern warnings that not only posts but even comments or replies, whether written, audio, video, or live can lead to criminal charges, imprisonment, and hefty fines under the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws.Under Federal Decree Law No. 34 of 2021, amended in 2024, online insults, defamation, and spreading of false or misleading information are criminal offenses. These laws protect individuals, businesses, and public officials from reputational harm caused by defamatory digital content. Authorities emphasize that users often underestimate that even short comment replies or live session remarks are recorded, traceable, and prosecutable.In recent years, the UAE has witnessed a growing number of enforcement actions against individuals who post negative reviews, comments, or defamatory content on social media.Several high-profile cases illustrate the seriousness of these laws in practice. In one instance, a woman was fined after posting a viral Instagram video criticizing a hospital. In another, a man was ordered to pay AED 70,000 in damages for defamatory remarks that harmed a business’s reputation. Legal experts warn that even emotional outbursts or venting personal grievances online can have legal repercussions, as the country’s cybercrime and defamation laws cover a wide range of digital expressions.Authorities have consistently urged residents and visitors to exercise caution in their online behaviour by avoiding personal attacks, abusive language, or insulting remarks, and to instead use official reporting channels when raising complaints. Senior law enforcement officials emphasize that all forms of digital communication, from written posts to comments, replies, live streams, and even private messages are monitored and recorded. Users are reminded to uphold values of respect, tolerance, and coexistence in line with the UAE’s cultural and social norms. The UAE’s National Media Office has further stressed that every social media user acts as an ambassador for the country’s reputation, carrying a responsibility to engage respectfully online. Under existing media regulations, breaches can result in severe administrative measures, including fines of up to AED 1 million or, in the case of media outlets, the closure of the establishment for violations.The UAE’s updated and strictly enforced cybercrime and defamation laws create a robust environment where online negative comments or defamatory remarks are treated as serious offenses. The legal framework aims to balance freedom of expression with protection against digital harm, ensuring peaceful and respectful online interactions in line with the country’s cultural and social values. Internet users and content creators are urged to recognize that every comment and post leaves a digital footprint that can have significant legal consequences, including large fines and imprisonment.","Uae has intensified its enforcement of laws against negative, abusive, and defamatory comments on social media.
