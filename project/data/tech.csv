Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes

In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don't just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5% of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India's bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80% phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams. ""When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,"" said Hany Farid, professor at University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. ""I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,"" Sitharaman said at an event in Mumbai. ""Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos that can manipulate people,"" she added.Given that over 97% of India's urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. ""Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,"" said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. ""The very term 'deepfake' comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,"" said Farid, calling the new term 'Generative AI' clever ""rebranding"" by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. ""We need to label everything as real or not real,"" said Farid. ""We need real disclosures,"" he added. To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our 'Don't Get Scammed' stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, ""if you don't know what's real, how will you know what's false""?","Armour up with toi to fight deepening threat of deepfakes. 85.5% of indian households owning at least one smartphone.

Stephen Curry and Under Armour stand at a surprising crossroads facing an unexpected twist

When Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors decided to pursue his signature sneakers with Under Armour, he set his own course. However, Under Armour stated on Thursday that they have split from Curry, and now the NBA pro will run the Curry Brand on its own. Following the release of his 13th and last signature shoe, Curry is leaving, concluding a 13-year collaboration.It happened after the debut of Curry's next signature shoe. It puts an end to a long-standing connection that began before Curry's first NBA championship. It is anticipated that Curry would take the ""Curry Brand"" with him as a stand-alone business. He is currently more valuable than ever because he has never been a sneaker free agent.Stephen Curry and Under Armour announced on Thursday that they had mutually decided to terminate their 13-year collaboration with immediate effect. At a time when the sportswear company is having trouble boosting sales, the abrupt move splits Curry Brand from Under Armour.Curry is now free to choose another retail partner. Although there seems to have been some desire for the Curry Brand to remain independent, it's not immediately evident what caused this separation.In a press release, Under Armour said:""Under Armour Inc. and Stephen Curry today announced plans to separate Curry Brand from Under Armour, ending a partnership that has redefined performance product and athlete-led storytelling for more than a decade. Under Armour, with a disciplined focus on its namesake brand, will develop new UA Basketball products and continue to support athletes and programs across every level of the game.""Addressing the whole thing, Steph said during a podcast:“Under Armour believed in me early in my career and gave me the space to build something much bigger and more impactful than a shoe. I'll always be grateful for that. What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change.”Meanwhile, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement:“For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround.. And for Stephen, it’s the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We’ll always be grateful for what he’s brought to the UA team.”It is anticipated that Curry would take the ""Curry Brand"" with him as a stand-alone business. According to a statement from Curry, via CNBC:""What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it’s only growing stronger.. I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.""After four years with Nike, Steph signed a contract with Under Armour in October 2013. After twelve years, the collaboration is coming to an end. One more Curry shoe is still on the horizon from Under Armour. As scheduled, the Curry 13 will debut in February 2026.Also read: What did Stephen Curry write to Ayesha Curry before dating?

Beast Land turns MrBeast’s YouTube universe into a real-world experience

“in the middle of the world,”





MrBeast’s highly anticipated Beast Land is finally open, marking the YouTuber’s boldest leap yet from online entertainment to real-world experiences. The 45-day pop-up theme park, located in Riyadh as part of Riyadh Season 2025, brings his famous YouTube challenges to life through large-scale attractions, obstacle courses, and adrenaline-pumping rides. Open from November 13 to December 27, Beast Land lets fans physically step inside the chaotic, high-energy world that has made MrBeast the most-subscribed YouTuber in history, with over 450 million followers worldwide.The theme park includes rides and games inspired by his viral stunts, from the catapult-powered Tower Siege to the heart-stopping Drop Zone trap doors and a zipline called Air Mail. Visitors can also take on two roller coasters, a 165-foot bungee jump, and a Sling Shot ride, all while exploring themed zones filled with challenges and merchandise. Ticket prices range from $7 for basic entry to $66 for full access, offering multiple tiers of engagement for fans eager to experience MrBeast’s universe beyond the screen.Beast Land isn’t just a theme park; it’s a test of how far creator-driven brands can go offline.

By transforming his digital content into real-life challenges, he’s testing whether fans who watch for free online will pay to step inside his world.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on Arattai app dropping out of top 100 list: ‘I literally told our employees…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-arattai-app-dropping-out-of-top-100-list-i-literally-told-our-employees/articleshow/125278324.cms,"Vembu: Zoho has long-term strategy









Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.While talking about end-to-end encryption of chats on Arattai, Vembu noted that the encryption feature has been implemented, however, it will take some more time for the updates to take effect.","Vembu: zoho has long-term strategy for messaging app arattai.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook .

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha ceo nithin kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following sebi’s recent advisory on digital gold. ‘most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there's not much you can do,’ wrote kamath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125291255,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Retail experience and purchase process at launch









Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE have jointly introduced iPhone Pocket, a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items. The product is described as a “piece of cloth” reimagined as a flexible pocket: its ribbed, open-knit fabric expands to enclose a device and lets users glimpse the display when stretched. iPhone Pocket is available in two strap lengths and multiple colours, and Apple frames it as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design and personal style. The launch is positioned as both a fashion collaboration and a product engineered for universal fit and everyday utility.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio. Crafted in Japan, the textile draws inspiration from the brand’s iconic pleats and is intended to function as an additional, wearable pocket for iPhone and other “pocketable items” such as AirPods. The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed.Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio.

The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed. Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.According to Apple, the iPhone Pocket is sized and structured to fit any iPhone model as well as small everyday items. The open knit expands to accommodate slightly bulkier contents and lets users peek at the iPhone display without removing the phone fully. Apple highlights multiple ways to use the accessory: handheld, attached to a bag, or worn on the body. The product is positioned as a fashion accessory as much as a utility item, emphasising styling and personal expression alongside practical carrying.Apple’s Newsroom states the iPhone Pocket was crafted in Japan and that its development and design unfolded through collaboration between ISSEY MIYAKE’s research and development teams and Apple Design Studio. The piece references ISSEY MIYAKE’s longstanding practice of pleating and textile innovation as the inspiration for the accessory’s knit structure. Apple quotes design leads from both organisations to underline the shared approach to simplicity, craftsmanship and adaptability.Apple positions iPhone Pocket as both fashion and function: the open knit and colour palette were explicitly selected to mix and match with iPhone finishes and to let users create personal combinations. Apple images show Pocket paired with iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air models in complementary colours. Practical use cases emphasised by Apple include carrying the iPhone and small items together, wearing the Pocket across the body for hands-free use, and tying it to other bags or accessories. Retail staff will assist customers in stores in selecting strap length and colour combinations.Apple’s announcement emphasises the crafted textile quality and the 3D-knitted construction, but does not publish a formal care guide in the Newsroom piece. Because iPhone Pocket is a textile accessory made in Japan using ISSEY MIYAKE’s knit techniques, consumers should expect typical fabric care considerations gentle handling, avoiding sharp objects, and following any care instructions included in product packaging or on Apple’s online product pages after purchase. For definitive care and warranty details, customers should consult Apple’s product page or in-store specialists at launch.Apple frames iPhone Pocket as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design language and expands how users carry and style their devices. The product is intended to sit alongside Apple’s existing accessory portfolio rather than replace protective cases: it emphasises wearability, textile design, and aesthetic pairing. Apple highlights the accessory’s ability to carry other small items (for example, AirPods) and to visually coordinate with iPhone finishes.Apple’s announcement lists the specific Apple Store locations where iPhone Pocket will be available at launch and notes that both online and in-store purchase options will be offered beginning November 14, 2025. Apple Specialists will help customers mix and match lengths and colours with their iPhone and demonstrate styling options. Customers outside the initial launch markets should monitor apple.com for availability updates.","Iphone pocket is a 3d-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iphone plus other small everyday items.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",Openai's chatbot violated german copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician herbert groenemeyer and others.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance. But if the EU allows packages valued under €150 to come in duty-free until 2028, companies will continue to take advantage of the loophole and European customers will likely keep shopping.","In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the eu.

Never wanted fancy things in life but simple things like peaceful walk, taking kids to open public spaces nearby , spending time in nature without going far are not possible. Air is polluted, food is not good ( fruits and milk specially ), traffic and roads are so bad. Biggest concern is civic sense. It is so bad that my kid keep asking me so many questions.His life was much better there and I feel I did injustice to him. Approaching 40 in few years and after coming back realized that surviving here professionally with this much experience is very difficult for my skillset. Seems everything is messed up in india,"" the man wrote.As the Redditor did not mention the state in India, social media users pointed out that it's unrealistic to expect that everything in India would change only in seven years. ""You should not have come back. And if you can, go back now. India will become only worse from here,"" one wrote.Some agreed with the Redditor's point of view and opined that India was much different and better when these people left India. ""People have that picture of India and all of a sudden that picture is broken once they are back to this new India,"" one wrote.""What is the purpose of your post? If you can move back to your foreign country please do. Otherwise, what are you even asking here. Or are trying to imply that those who are returning to their home to be with parents or for whatever reasons should not return because YOU do not like it in India. What a way of imposing your personal limited world view on other Indians!"" one wrote. Some pointed out that the person has been ranting against India on Reddit in various posts, not seeking any genuine advice.","A redditor made a controversial post about his experience of coming back to india after 7 years.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.",Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

Oman Vision 2040





The Sultanate of Oman has initiated a monumental shift in its immigration policy, positioning itself as a premier destination for the world's creative elite. Announced through Decision No. 156/2025 and officially taking effect on November 10, 2025, the government has introduced a brand-new Cultural Visa and Cultural Residence category, marking a fundamental update to the country’s existing laws on foreign residency.Oman’s new residency scheme is deliberately structured for longevity, encouraging international contributors to establish deep roots rather than planning transient stays. Applicants are offered highly flexible validity choices: both the visa and the subsequent residency are accessible for periods of one year, five years, or a maximum of ten years.This commitment to long-term residency affords scholars the necessary time to pursue multi-year research projects and allows artists to develop lasting ties to the local community and region. Furthermore, the program is exceptionally inclusive: spouses and first-degree relatives are eligible for a Cultural Joining Visa or Residence, supporting professionals who relocate with their families.One of the most attractive elements of the new policy is the remarkably budget-conscious fee structure.The costs are deliberately low to encourage long-term commitment, signaling that Oman views cultural contribution as a high-value investment. The fees are set at an annual rate, regardless of the chosen validity, and are clearly differentiated for the main applicant versus accompanying family members.This structure ensures that the financial burden of the permit itself remains minimal, allowing professionals to dedicate resources to their creative endeavors. The new resident must remember to enter the Sultanate within three months of the visa's issuance to officially validate the document.Eligibility is broad, encompassing individuals across the entire cultural and academic spectrum. The new visa targets professionals who enrich the creative environment, including writers, poets, performers, designers, researchers, musicians, and curators. The primary administrative requirement involves securing a local sponsor: the visa is processed only upon the request of a recognised Omani cultural body. This institutional sponsor, such as a government ministry, a university, a festival organizer, or an established cultural center confirms the legitimate purpose of the applicant's presence.This program transcends immigration reform; it is a critical strategy underpinning Oman Vision 2040, the national blueprint for economic diversification. By directly attracting global intellectual talent, Oman is making a decisive pivot toward establishing itself as a future creative capital. The policy is designed to foster profound knowledge collaboration, boost cultural tourism, and generate new economic value driven by the arts.The initiative sends a clear message: Oman is looking outward, seeking to augment its national heritage by integrating global ideas and providing a dynamic new stage for the world’s most talented creators.",Oman launches cultural visa to attract global talent.
