Just move your heels: A 3-min trick may reduce post-meal sugar spike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-move-your-heels-a-3-min-trick-may-reduce-post-meal-sugar-spike/articleshow/128284378.cms,"NEW DELHI: What if lowering your blood sugar did not require a treadmill, gym membership or even standing up?A new scientific review published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews suggests that something as simple as lifting your heels while sitting could sharply reduce post-meal sugar spikes. At a time when India is facing a surge in type 2 diabetes — increasingly among younger and sedentary adults — researchers say targeted lower-limb muscle activity may offer a practical, low-cost tool for millions.The review highlights the role of the soleus muscle, located deep in the calf. Unlike larger leg muscles that fatigue quickly, the soleus is built for endurance and can remain active for extended periods.“We often think of the heart as the only vital pump in the body, but the soleus muscle in the calf acts as a ‘second heart.’ When activated regularly, it not only improves circulation but also works like a powerful metabolic sink — helping remove excess sugar from the bloodstream, even while we are sitting,” said a lead author Dr Raju Vaishya, Apollo Hospital, Delhi.In experiments reviewed in the study, seated soleus contractions during a three-hour glucose test reduced post-meal sugar by 39-52% and cut insulin response by up to 60% compared to prolonged sitting.Disrupting sitting every 30 minutes with three minutes of light leg activity reduced insulin spikes by 26% in overweight adults and improved post-meal and overnight glucose levels in those with type 2 diabetes.The science is straightforward. Skeletal muscle accounts for nearly 80% of glucose uptake after meals. Activating the soleus stimulates insulin-independent pathways that help transport glucose into muscle cells, making it particularly useful for people with insulin resistance.Corresponding author Anoop Misra from Fortis said lower limb muscle strength is closely linked to glucose control and blood circulation, not just mobility. He noted that simple seated exercises such as soleus push-ups, which activate the calf muscles, can significantly lower blood sugar without requiring strenuous activity, making them a practical option for India’s largely sedentary population.“We found simple seated movements like soleus push-ups can significantly reduce post-meal sugar spikes — offering a practical solution for people who can’t perform strenuous exercise. You don’t need a gym to improve metabolism. Small, sustained muscle activation — especially of the soleus — can deliver powerful benefits for diabetes prevention and heart health,” Dr Vaishya added.It also found a 40-minute stretching session lowered blood glucose by up to 28 mg/dL and improved circulation. While experts caution seated heel raises are not a substitute for regular exercise, for elderly or obese people, they may offer a practical way to improve metabolic health.","Simple seated exercises like soleus push-ups can significantly reduce post-meal sugar spikes.

'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Artificial intelligence has an exciting role to play in fields like drug discovery, scientific progress and disease treatment. But given the pace at which it is evolving, there is a real prospect of AI becoming more powerful than its creator, warns Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web.Humanity will have to figure out to how deal with super intelligence, says Berners-Lee, striking a note of caution at a time when companies and govts seem to be in a race to develop AI without really thinking through the consequences.Speaking to Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, Berners-Lee described ChatGPT as a ""phase change"", which surprised him with its conversational power. He emphasised that the critical question is who an AI works for.He argued for assistants that serve the user's best interests - analogous to a doctor's duty - rather than corporate incentives. He connected this to his Solid project and his company's work on user-controlled data ""pods"", aiming to restore agency by letting individuals control and selectively share their personal data, including in child-safe configurations with parental oversight.Berners-Lee also contrasted the early web's democratic spirit with today's platform-dominated experience. In the beginning, individuals could publish their own websites and participate on equal footing with major institutions.","Tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, spoke to jaya bhattacharji rose.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","Jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in march 2025.

NEW DELHI: India’s IT services sector must pivot decisively to stay ahead in the AI era, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday, amid concerns in the sector related to generative AI tools such as Anthropic’s Claude, which recently triggered stock dips in firms like TCS, Infosys and other IT firms.“If we are looking at becoming a major AI player, a major player in the future of tech... we have to reimagine ourselves. There’s no way we can live in the past. We have to quickly reorient, accept the future, adopt it,” Goyal said, adding, “India’s IT industry will continue to thrive despite disruption.”Goyal also said AI should be seen as an enabler rather than a threat. “AI will support us in our world. I’m not worried about job losses. We train, retrain, we reskill. I’m confident we’ll add jobs in this. But if we don’t stay alert and active, then we could start losing,” he said, adding that alongside AI adoption, companies must strengthen cybersecurity and data governance.Goyal urged industry to seize opportunities in cloud, data centres and applied AI rather than worry about long-term large language model development. He called for attracting global investments into India instead of sending talent overseas. “Bring investments to India, create jobs here, skill our people and keep that talent here… we’ll create some IP here.”","India’s it services sector must pivot decisively to stay ahead in the ai era, commerce and industry minister piyush goyal said.

Anxiety in the industry over AI and jobs



IBM has reportedly announced that it will triple the entry-level hiring in the US in 2026, even as artificial intelligence raises concerns about the future of early-career jobs. According to a report by Bloomberg, the IBM chief human resources officer Nickel LaMoreaux said that the expansion will cut across departments. Speaking at the Charter’s Leading with AI Summit in New York, LaMoreaux said, “And yes, it’s for all these jobs that we’re being told AI can do,” underscoring the company’s commitment to investing in human talent despite the increasing automation pressures.LaMoreaux further explained that IBM has revamped the job descriptions for junior positions such as software developers. Since AI tools can now handle the routine coding tasks, entry-level developers spend less time in writing code and more time working directly with customers. In HR, the junior staffers are tasked with intervening when chatbots fall short and correcting outputs and engaging with managers rather hand handling every inquiry themselves. “The entry-level jobs that you had two to three years ago, AI can do most of them,” LaMoreaux said.“So, if you’re going to convince your business leaders that you need to make this investment, then you need to be able to show the real value these individuals can bring now.”The announcement made by IBM comes at a time when fears of job cuts are lingering on the industry. The industry fear that AI could wipe out opportunities for the new graduates. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also warned that half of entry-level jobs may vanish by 2030. Advances in generative AI have already stoked anxiety among college students facing a tough job market.Some companies have cut back on early-career recruitment to save costs, but LaMoreaux cautioned that this could backfire. Without a pipeline of junior hires, firms risk a shortage of mid-level managers in the future, forcing them to poach talent from competitors — a more expensive and slower process.Melanie Rosenwasser, Chief People Officer at Dropbox also believe that younger workers are uniquely positioned to thrive in the AI era. “It’s like they’re biking in the Tour de France and the rest of us still have training wheels.”",Ibm has reportedly announced that it will triple the entry-level hiring in the us in 2026.

Challenges and considerations ahead of electric seagliders' launch in the UAE



Regulation and Safety: Electric seagliders, as a new class of vehicle, will require clear rules and safety protocols, especially where they crossover between maritime and aviation domains.

Since WIG technology operates close to the surface, performance in rough seas or adverse conditions will need careful evaluation. Infrastructure: Harbours, ports, and docking facilities will need upgrades to support widespread seaglider operations.





A groundbreaking new electric seaglider transport system that promises to let people literally glide across the water could soon become a reality in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE, signalling a major shift in how coastal travel and logistics are handled across the region. The concept, which blends high-speed marine and aircraft technologies with zero emissions, is advancing rapidly through government partnerships and private sector innovation.Electric seagliders are fully electric, Wing-in-Ground-Effect (WIG) craft, designed to travel just above the water’s surface using aerodynamic lift combined with hydrofoil technology. These vehicles are more efficient than traditional boats and far quicker than typical marine transport because they ride on a cushion of air over the water.A prominent model in development is the REGENT Viceroy, an electric WIG vehicle capable of carrying several passengers at speeds potentially reaching 290 kph (180 mph), with long-range capabilities as battery technology advances.According to recent updates, Abu Dhabi leaders and transport authorities have signed a deal with operators to bring electric seagliders to the emirate by 2028. These craft, which combine zero emissions and high speed, are expected to connect coastal communities like Abu Dhabi City and Al Dhafra Region initially, with plans to expand routes across the broader UAE coast.The project reflects a strategic collaboration involving the Department of Culture and Tourism, Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi), the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) and the Integrated Transport Centre (Abu Dhabi Mobility) alongside private operators. Badr Al-Olama, Director General of ADIO, has emphasised that seagliders could position Abu Dhabi at the forefront of next-generation coastal transportation, integrating smart and sustainable mobility into everyday life.The potential applications of this new tech are wide-ranging:Prototype and development efforts are already underway as electric seaglider models have entered sea testing phases with crew onboard and full-scale testing has been reported by developers in the U.S. ahead of expected passenger flights. REGENT, the main company driving this technology and its partners, expect commercial readiness between 2026 and 2028, aligning with Abu Dhabi’s plans for phased rollouts and expanded mobility options along coastal routes.The UAE’s interest in seagliders sits alongside a wider effort to develop electric and autonomous transport solutions across land, air and sea. Initiatives such as electric air taxi ambitions in Abu Dhabi and advanced road automation trials showcase a holistic approach to future mobility. Embedded in policy visions like the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 Strategy, these innovations aim not just to improve travel times but to reduce carbon footprints, encourage clean technology adoption and transform how people and goods move in the 21st century.Despite the promise, several challenges remain:These issues reflect the broader maturation curve for any disruptive transport technology entering public use. As the UAE pushes toward diversified, sustainable transportation models, electric seagliders represent a visionary leap beyond traditional ferries and hydrofoils. They encapsulate cutting-edge engineering, zero-emission ambitions and a shift toward seamless coastal mobility and if plans proceed as expected, we may soon see them gliding above UAE waters within the next few years.Electric seagliders, once futuristic concept vehicles, are now transitioning from prototype to planned deployments in the UAE. With projected commercial operations by 2028 and partnerships spanning government, logistics and energy sectors, this innovative mode of transport could redefine coastal travel, tourism and logistics across the Emirates, showing how sustainable mobility solutions are reshaping the world’s busiest maritime corridors.","Here's when abu dhabi is planning to launch electric seagliders, future of coastal travel in the uae.

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""made o'meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time. Users can set preferences, like ""no usa-owned brands"" or ""only eu-based brands"" another danish app, ""nonusa,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of february.

Industry operations exposed

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into china's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128024592,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1235780,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Dubai is taking a major leap toward next-generation mobility with the imminent launch of fully autonomous ride-hailing services in the city through a high-profile partnership between Baidu’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicle platform and Uber . This cutting-edge mobility option, supported by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), is set to begin operations in Dubai’s Jumeirah area soon, making it one of the world’s first cities to offer robotaxi rides at scale via a mainstream app.The deal brings Baidu’s Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing service to the Uber platform, allowing passengers in Dubai to book driverless vehicles much like normal Uber rides. Riders will use the familiar Uber app to request a self-driving trip by selecting an “Autonomous” option or by booking through UberX or Uber Comfort and being matched with an Apollo Go vehicle.This operational rollout represents a new phase of autonomous mobility: the vehicles are expected to be fully self-driving, without a human safety driver, once initial deployment is complete and regulatory approval is finalised.Baidu’s Apollo Go has already laid the groundwork well before this launch. In late 2025, it received Dubai’s first fully driverless testing permit from the RTA and ran open-road trials with its fleet. This licence marked the first time a company was authorised to conduct fully unmanned autonomous vehicle operations in the city.Dubai also inaugurated a dedicated autonomous vehicle operations centre, Apollo Go’s first outside China, to support testing, maintenance, safety systems and fleet control.The plan is to scale the service over time, with aspirations to expand the autonomous fleet to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years as part of the city’s broader transport vision.Dubai’s new service launch is not just about novelty, it is part of a strategic effort to modernise transport infrastructure and create a smarter, safer, more efficient urban mobility ecosystem -This deploy­ment marks a high-visibility example of how cities can embrace artificial intelligence, sensors, advanced decision-making systems and smart infrastructure to improve everyday mobility for residents and visitors.Initially, autonomous vehicles will be available in key zones like the Jumeirah area, with service coverage expanding as data from early operations and regulatory frameworks evolve. Over time, the project is expected to become more seamless, with autonomous vehicles operating across broader urban areas.Passengers will enjoy:The autonomous ride-hailing launch follows years of groundwork, including pilot projects with safety drivers and other autonomous vehicle initiatives. Dubai is not alone in piloting such services as variations of robotaxis are being tested in many leading high-tech cities but integrating them into a mainstream ride-hailing platform at this level makes Dubai a global leader in real-world autonomous deployment.The initiative also builds on wider UAE advancements, including plans for other autonomous services and smart city innovations that are positioning the Emirates as a global hub for future mobility and tech commercialisation.Despite the enthusiasm, autonomous ride-hailing still faces hurdles -The arrival of Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing in Dubai via Uber is a major milestone in the evolution of urban transportation, combining AI-driven vehicles, strategic government support and world-class infrastructure. As this service transitions from pilot to public rollout in 2026, it could redefine how people move through the city, reduce reliance on traditional drivers, and advance Dubai’s smart city aspirations into tangible reality.",Dubai's robotaxis are here as baidu and uber technologies collaborate with roads and transport authority: are you ready to ride with ai?

Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest integrated energy and chemicals company, has announced a major breakthrough in its In-Kingdom Total Value Add (iktva) programme by achieving a 70% local content benchmark in its supply chain, a milestone that underscores the Kingdom’s push to build domestic industrial capacity and diversify its economy. This achievement comes as a part of a long-term strategy tied to Saudi Vision 2030 and has already delivered substantial economic benefits, including significant job creation and foreign investment.Launched in 2015, the iktva programme aims to maximise economic value within Saudi Arabia by localising procurement of goods and services, developing local suppliers and fostering a competitive national industrial ecosystem. Through the initiative, Aramco encourages global investors and manufacturers to establish operations in the Kingdom, boosting domestic production and supporting broader economic diversification efforts.Reaching a 70% local content rate means that most of Aramco’s procurement spending now remains in-Kingdom, a massive shift from earlier years when the majority of materials and services were imported. This localisation strengthens Saudi Arabia’s supply-chain resilience, mitigates exposure to global disruptions, and builds a robust industrial base capable of supporting both energy and non-energy sectors.The company has also reaffirmed its plan to raise local content further to 75% by 2030, signalling continued investment in national capabilities and competitiveness.Perhaps the most tangible effect of Aramco’s iktva success has been employment and economic expansion across Saudi Arabia:These outcomes show how iktva has not only tightened linkages between local suppliers and Saudi Aramco’s global operations but has also created a multiplier effect through job creation, skills development and supplier capability upgrades.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 sees the energy sector as a springboard for broader economic transformation. Localising Aramco’s procurement spending aligns with that vision by nurturing local manufacturing, boosting exports, and reducing dependence on foreign supply chains.By concentrating procurement within the Kingdom, the programme incentivises suppliers to upgrade capacity and quality, which enhances Saudi Arabia’s industrial competitiveness. This involves identifying opportunities across diverse sectors, from chemicals and metals to services, electrical components and machinery, laying the foundation for future export growth.Recent decades have seen global supply chains disrupted by geopolitical events, pandemics and inflationary pressures. Localising a significant portion of Aramco’s procurement through iktva reduces external risk exposure, ensuring critical energy infrastructure is supported by a strengthened domestic ecosystem.Part of the iktva strategy has involved teaming up with private and public partners to broaden workforce training. Historical data from company initiatives shows that Aramco has collaborated with stakeholders to establish national training centres, equipping thousands of Saudi workers with marketable skills, a cornerstone of broader workforce localisation efforts.Though not included in the latest release, previous iktva forums and events highlighted how these training and certification initiatives help Saudis enter technical, management and advanced manufacturing roles, aligning human capital development with local industry needs.Aramco’s localisation drive is not just inward-facing. Through iktva, the company has hosted regional supplier forums, drawing global investors, manufacturers and service providers. These events help integrate Saudi Arabia into global supply networks and expand opportunities for both local and international firms seeking to contribute to and benefit from the Kingdom’s growth trajectory.This strategy also supports export capabilities, enabling products manufactured in Saudi Arabia to reach international markets as local suppliers mature and scale capacity.Saudi Aramco’s achievement of the 70% localisation benchmark is a pivotal step toward its 2030 target of 75% local content, reflecting sustained progress over more than a decade of strategic efforts. Automotive, petrochemical, electrical and industrial products made locally enhance the Kingdom’s economic stack, while new jobs strengthen the domestic labour market.By converting procurement spending into economic multipliers, the programme is seen as one of the most effective supply-chain-led industrial transformation models globally, melding energy-sector leadership with broader economic diversification. Saudi Arabia’s localisation milestones under iktva are significant not just for Aramco but for the Kingdom’s long-term economic resilience.As the global energy landscape evolves and diversification becomes imperative, the ability to develop local industries, create jobs and attract investment positions Saudi Arabia for a future where domestic capability matters as much as hydrocarbon wealth. This milestone reinforces the dual mission of strengthening national supply chains and supporting economic breadth, a key pillar of Vision 2030’s promise to transform Saudi Arabia into a thriving, diversified global economy.","Saudi aramco achieves 70% local content milestone in supply chain, boosting saudi vision 2030.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout. Applicants who provided biometrics recently will not be asked to give them again just because of the new document type.However, travellers planning long-term travel or frequent international journeys are encouraged to transition early to the e-Passport to enjoy the full suite of benefits proactively.From October 28, 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE, including renewals and new passports, must be filed through the GPSP 2.0 portal, which supports online registration, document upload and appointment booking at BLS centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Applicants should ensure their photographs comply with ICAO standards to avoid delays or rejection. These strict photo requirements were introduced in September 2025 and apply to all passport applications, including e-Passports.India’s new chip-enabled e-Passport represents a major leap in travel document technology, offering faster immigration processing, enhanced security and future-proof compatibility with global systems. For UAE-based Indians, applying now through the modern GPSP 2.0 digital process can mean smoother travel experiences both within the Gulf and around the world.","Indian expatriates in the united arab emirates are being urged to adopt india’s new chip-enabled e- passport.

Early birds still get the best deals, especially in Economy Class



When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees



Low Fare Calendar: Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows.

Best Price Guarantee: If you find a lower price elsewhere for the exact same Emirates flight, the airline promises to refund the difference (terms apply).

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

Some data, for airlines in general, suggest booking at odd hours (late night or early morning) can reveal hidden dips in dynamic pricing, though this is not specific to Emirates’ own official pricing logic.

If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools. The early-booking trend revealed in recent travel patterns indicates that passengers securing tickets months in advance, particularly for family travel in Economy Class, enjoy more competitive pricing and smoother travel planning.By combining early planning, flexible dates, smart fare search tools and loyalty programs, you can significantly improve your odds of finding lower Emirates airfare and stretching your travel budget farther.",When is the cheapest time to book emirates flights in 2026? Takeaway: strategy and seasonal trends often yield lower economy fares. Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel. Use emirates’ low fare calendar and best price guarantee features.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128235492,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-53282,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

His persistence paid off massively: ‘FA9LA’ (which means “vibe” or “party” in Bahraini dialect) actually set a Guinness World Record by topping four Billboard Arabia charts simultaneously.Before conquering India, he was already collaborating with icons like Shaggy and The Game.Now, he’s coming to India to bridge the gap between Middle Eastern and Desi hip-hop, proving that a great beat needs no translation.While Flipperachi has been a legend in the Gulf for two decades, he truly ""arrived"" in India through the 2025 blockbuster film Dhurandhar.The track ‘FA9LA’ (pronounced) was used as the bone-chilling, high-octane entry theme for Akshaye Khanna’s character, Rehman Dakait.The combination of Khanna's swagger and the track's pounding rhythm, which subtly blends Arabic hip-hop with Indian tabla percussion, created a cultural crossover moment unlike any other. Despite the Arabic lyrics, the song's energy transcended language, fueling over 10 million social media clips and helping the film cross the ₹450 crore mark at the box office.Flipperachi is now bringing his global rap energy to India with his first live performance, thrilling fans who discovered him through the Dhurandhar craze.Confirmed details:The concerts are being produced by major promoters, including Eva Live and Zee Live, powered by Mastercard, highlighting the confidence in his India crossover appeal.If you think the song hits hard on a 6-inch phone screen, wait until you feel the bass through a professional stadium rig. Flipperachi’s live shows are famous for being high-octane, immersive experiences that lean heavily into the ""vibe"" (the literal translation of Fa9la). Here is what fans in Mumbai and Bengaluru can look forward to:Expect a heavy rotation of his chart-toppers. While ‘FA9LA’ is the guaranteed showstopper, he’ll also perform hits like ‘Ee Laa’, ‘Shoofha’, and ‘Nayda’, which have already garnered millions of views globally.Organizers Eva Live and Zee Live are promising a production that matches the cinematic scale of Dhurandhar. Think massive LED screens, synced light shows, and high-energy visuals that reflect the gritty, urban spirit of his music.Whether you’re a die-hard hip-hop head or just someone who can’t get that Dhurandhar beat out of your head, this is the one show you cannot afford to miss.
