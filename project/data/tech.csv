Can we control comps with just thoughts? Shubhanshu Shukla & crew may find out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-we-control-comps-with-just-thoughts-shubhanshu-shukla-crew-may-find-out/articleshow/122215910.cms,"Will aid people On Earth



Can human thought — unaided by muscle or speech — be used to control machines? That’s the bold question the Ax-4 crew, including Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, are probing at the International Space Station (ISS).Wearing a specialised headset that tracks blood flow in the brain, the astronauts participated in “PhotonGrav”, a European Space Agency (ESA) and Polish Space Agency (POLSA) experiment exploring whether brain signals alone could one day operate computers and spacecraft systems.The headset uses near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor attention levels and detect logical errors, capturing neural activity without any physical movement. If successful, this research could revolutionise how astronauts interact with onboard systems — especially in high-stress or hands-free conditions — by turning thought into action.While the crew kicked off the study on day four of their stay at the ISS, the project led by Slawosz Uznanski is expected to continue through their stint there. As space missions grow longer and more complex, projects like PhotonGrav could lay the groundwork for more seamless, intuitive interfaces — maybe even bringing science fiction a step closer to everyday use.While the experiment is being trialled in orbit, its real-world impact could be profound, as per ESA and Axiom Space. On Earth, the same brain-computer interface technology could power new assistive tools for people with mobility or communication challenges, and offer breakthroughs in neurorehabilitation.Shux, who had begun his research at ISS with myogenesis study, which could uncover how microgravity contributes to muscle loss before moving on to his microalgae study, continued the operations for myogenesis in the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) of the ISS.The study, by identifying the molecular pathways behind skeletal muscle dysfunction, could lead to targeted therapies to prevent atrophy during long-duration spaceflight. These insights may also translate to improved treatments for muscle-wasting conditions on Earth, including those linked to aging and immobility.“Finally, the crew documented activities for the Astronaut Mental Health study, contributing to research on cognitive well-being in space. This project can benefit others on Earth by developing remote technologies for diagnosing and treating mental disorders, particularly for individuals in isolated or challenging environments where access to mental health care is limited,” Axiom Space said.An ultrasound scan was conducted as part of the “Telemetric Health AI” study, which merges biometric data with mission analytics to better understand how spaceflight affects cardiovascular and balance systems. “Using advanced data science, the project aims to enable smarter, real-time health monitoring for astronauts with potential applications for remote health care on Earth,” Axiom said.","Will aid people on earth by turning thought into action.

NEW DELHI: Vehicle aggregators such as Uber, Ola and Rapido won't be allowed to onboard cars, buses, three-wheelers and motorcycles that are over eight years old. They will also have to mandatorily comply with targets set by state govts for inclusion of electric and zero emission vehicles in their fleet, road transport ministry said in revised guidelines for aggregators.The ministry said aggregators will have to ensure that the driver's licence and vehicle permit are displayed on the back of the front seat next to the driver so that passengers can clearly see it. While three-wheelers and private motorcycles are at present operating through aggregators in several states, the central guideline has formally included them in the policy to bring clarity as some states do not allow bikes on such platforms.The guidelines said drivers need to undergo a psychological analysis conducted by aggregators to determine whether ""they are fit to be on-boarded"". It said that aggregators can't prohibit or restrict on-boarded drivers from operating with multiple aggregators.","Vehicle aggregators won't be allowed to onboard cars, buses, three-wheelers and motorcycles that are over eight years old.

The Milwaukee Bucks’ Shocking Roster Shake-Up

Giannis’ Real Reaction: No Goodbye Post

Why the Rumor Spread

The Bucks’ Perspective and Giannis’ Future

Themade a bold move by waiving, a move that immediately raised questions about the future of the franchise and the mindset of its superstar,. Amidst the social media frenzy, rumors quickly circulated that Giannis had posted a ""goodbye"" message—fueling speculation about his own future in Milwaukee. Here’s what actually happened, based on the latest credible reporting.On July 1, 2025, the Milwaukee Bucks made two headline-grabbing moves: they waived Damian Lillard—stretching the $113 million left on his contract—and signed free agent center Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million deal. Lillard, who suffered a torn Achilles in the playoffs, was expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season, prompting Milwaukee to aggressively reshape the roster around Giannis.Despite viral claims, Giannis Antetokounmpo did not post a goodbye message to Damian Lillard or the Milwaukee Bucks. Instead, his only public reaction was a cryptic social media post expressing confusion about the team’s direction. According to multiple reports, Giannis posted, “I don't know what's going on right now,” shortly before news of Lillard’s waiving broke.This message was interpreted as surprise and perhaps frustration, but it was not a farewell or an indication that he was leaving Milwaukee.NBA insider Chris Haynes, who is well-connected with both Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, reported that Giannis was “not pleased” with the Bucks’ decision to waive Damian Lillard. However, Haynes clarified that Giannis’ displeasure was more about the coldness and manner of the move rather than a desire to leave the team himself. Haynes stated, “He just didn’t appreciate how it was handled,” and noted that Giannis is now reassessing his future but has not made any public demands or posted a goodbye.The rumor of a “goodbye post” appears to have originated from misinterpretations and the emotional tone of Giannis Antetokounmpo’s actual post. The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to waive Lillard—who was brought in as Giannis’ co-star in a blockbuster 2023 trade—sparked immediate speculation about whether Giannis would follow him out the door. However, there is no evidence that Giannis has requested a trade or is preparing to leave Milwaukee at this time.Milwaukee’s front office made the move to create cap flexibility and keep the team competitive during Giannis Antetokounmpo’s prime years, especially with Damian Lillard likely sidelined for the season. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis was on board with the acquisition of Myles Turner, and both players valued the opportunity to partner on the court. Still, the abrupt release of Lillard has added uncertainty about Giannis’ long-term commitment, with insiders noting this is “one more thing added to the equation” as he considers his future.Giannis Antetokounmpo has not shared a goodbye post following the news of Damian Lillard being waived. In fact, his only public reaction has been a cryptic message expressing confusion rather than a farewell.According to NBA insiders, Giannis is indeed frustrated by the situation, but his displeasure is directed at the process itself, not the Milwaukee Bucks organization as a whole. There are no public signs suggesting that Giannis is seeking a trade or planning to leave Milwaukee at this time.Also read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Becomes NBA’s Highest-Paid Player with $285M Thunder Extension After Historic MVP Season As the Milwaukee Bucks prepare to move forward with a revamped roster, all attention remains on Giannis, whose next move will be pivotal in determining the franchise’s future.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae cervantes worked as an engineering technician at tesla's gigafactory in nevada for seven years.

This season will mark the beginning of the new seasonal format, where every season will run for two months, with the mid-season refresh planned to be released in the second month.As announced earlier, Marvel Rivals will now launch a hero each month, and we have already got our new characters for the upcoming two months - Phoenix (Jean Grey) and Blade. Along with new maps like Klynter and new team-up abilities, fans are already hyped up about Season 3. However, the most exciting addition of this season is yet to be explored.The official YouTube channel of Marvel Rivals has recently hosted the Volumer 7 od Dev Vision, where the Creative Director Guanguyn Chen and other development team members of the game talked about the upcoming season, The Abyss Awakens. In this video, they confirmed that there will be a new feature called mix and match skins MVP animations, which fans have been wanting for a long time.Previously, players used to don the same skin in order to execute the MVP animation, the one which comes clubbed with that particular skin bundle. However, that same skin might not be suitable to wear in the whole match.Still, for the sake of using that animation, players had to equip that skin as that specific MVP animation can’t be used with any other skin.However, as the new feature is confirmed, players don’t need to worry anymore. After the arrival of Season 3, players will be able to wear any skin they want, and still, they will be able to execute the MVP animation associated with any skin bundle.However, it seems the MVP animation will use the same skin as its bundle and the gameplay skin will be different. The final frame of the MVP animation is actually pre-rendered, and combining MVP animations with new skins would be a tough job for the developers.But if it comes out the other way around, then this feature will open a new dimension of customization in Marvel Rivals as it will make MVP animations of other skins more appealing, which actually don’t have any. A detailed overview about this feature is yet to be disclosed by the developers, so the functionality of this feature is still unknown.","Season 3 in marvel rivals is knocking at the door as the upcoming seasonal update is going to be dropped on july 11, 2025.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.s. jaishankar launches passport seva 2.0 in india.

OpenAI: “Someone has broken into our home”

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly offering massive pay packages— up to $300 million over four years—to top AI talent for the company’s new ‘Superintelligence’ lab. Quoting unnamed sources, Wired reports that Meta has made at least 10 high-value offers to staffers at OpenAI. The offers include compensation along with company stock - a big part of it is given right away in the first year—bringing the total pay to over $100 million. Beyond these benefits, Zuckerberg is reportedly telling potential hires they won’t have to worry about access to computing resources—especially high-demand GPUs, which can make or break research success.According to the report, many OpenAI employees said they are weighing the huge payouts against how much impact they could make at Meta compared to their current roles. “That’s about how much it would take for me to go work at Meta,” said one OpenAI employee who spoke to WIRED anonymously.Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told the publication “Some people have chosen to greatly exaggerate what’s happening for their own purposes.”“These statements are untrue — the size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place.”Still, the numbers speak volumes. A senior engineer currently working at Meta told WIRED they earn about $850,000 per year—already high by industry standards, but nowhere close to what Meta is reportedly offering to a select few. Engineers in the tier above (E7s) reportedly make around $1.54 million annually, based on public data from Levels.FYI.Meta’s Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth acknowledged during a Q&A with employees that some roles do command premium pay—but pushed back on the $100 million figure.“Look, you guys, the market's hot. It's not that hot. Okay? So it's just a lie,” Bosworth said.“We have a small number of leadership roles that we're hiring for, and those people do command a premium,” he added.“It’s not a sign-on bonus, but all these different things,” he added, referring to how the offers are structured.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially introduced Meta’s new Superintelligence Labs on Monday in a note to staff. Former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang is now Meta’s Chief AI Officer, joined by Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO. The two will co-lead the team.Notably, neither Wang nor Friedman are researchers in the traditional academic sense. Meta has not named a chief scientist or research head yet. According to sources, none of the OpenAI hires so far have received the full $300 million package.The hiring spree has rattled leadership at OpenAI. Mark Chen, the company’s Chief Research Officer, reportedly told staff: “It feels as if someone has broken into our home and stolen something.”Chen acknowledged that OpenAI is adjusting compensation to remain competitive but emphasized that it would not sacrifice fairness.",Meta denies paying up to $300 million to openai researchers.

iPhone 16e vs Pixel 9a: Everything you need to know about Apple and Google's new budget flagships

As the launch of Apple iPhone 17 series gets closer, rumorus about the upcoming iPhone series have increased. The 2025 iPhone lineup may consist of four models – iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and the all-new iPhone 17 Air. Tipster Majin Bu recently shared alleged renders of the iPhone 17 Pro that shows a significant design change with the coming-soon device. The leakster, in a blog post, claims that the Cupertino-based company may reposition the Apple logo which is currently placed slightly off-center and below the camera module since the iPhone X. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, the logo may now be moved lower, toward the center bottom of the phone. “This recent discovery, reported by direct sources among case manufacturers, marks an evolution in Apple’s aesthetic language,” Bu writes.The report adds that the repositioning of Apple logo has raised concerns among manufacturers about possible interference, leading the industry to look for ways to ensure continued compatibility. Some factories have already produced cases based on the current design and are waiting for official confirmation before making changes. To address the issue, case makers are working on design changes.A report by The Information previously said that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with a redesigned rear panel composed of both aluminum and glass. It may feature an aluminum rear panel, housing a camera bump, bigger than the one found on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The report further added that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with an aluminium frame, replacing the titanium frame like their predecessors.On the specifications part, the phone may come powered by Apple’s A19 Pro chip, manufactured using TSMC’s 3nm process. iPhone 17 Pro is said to offer 12GB of RAM, up from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 8GB. For camera duties, it may have a 48MP telephoto lens, replacing the 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro. For selfies, the smartphone is tipped to have a 24MP sensor.","The 2025 iphone lineup may consist of four models – iphone 17, iphone17 pro, iphone 17 pro max and the all-new iphone 17 air.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.
