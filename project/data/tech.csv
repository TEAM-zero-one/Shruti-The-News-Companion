India could generate 11 mn tonnes of solar waste by 2047: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-could-generate-11-mn-tonnes-of-solar-waste-by-2047-study/articleshow/125136313.cms,"India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules, according to two studies published on Thursday.Managing this waste would require nearly 300 recycling plants across the country and an investment of around Rs 4,200 crore, said the studies by Delhi-based think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The studies also said that recovering and reusing materials from discarded solar panels could create a Rs 3,700-crore market opportunity by 2047.If this potential is realised, recovering valuable materials such as silicon, copper, aluminium and silver from solar waste could meet 38 per cent of the sector's manufacturing inputs by 2047 and avoid 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions by replacing virgin resources with recycled ones.India's solar module recycling market is currently at a very early stage, with only a few commercial recyclers operating.The CEEW studies provide India's first comprehensive blueprint for building a domestic solar recycling ecosystem that supports both clean energy and manufacturing self-reliance.Rishabh Jain, Fellow, CEEW, said, ""India's solar revolution can power a new green industrial opportunity. By embedding circularity into our clean energy systems, we can recover critical minerals, strengthen supply chains and create green jobs while turning potential waste into lasting value.Building this circular economy is most important for India's resilient and responsible growth.""The CEEW studies also said that solar recycling in a formal setup remains unviable today, with recyclers facing losses of Rs 10,000-12,000 per tonne.The biggest operational expense is buying back waste modules, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total (around Rs 600 per panel), followed by processing, collection and disposal costs.For recycling to become profitable, modules would need to be priced below Rs 330 or recyclers supported through EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) certificate trading, tax incentives and R&D investments in efficient recovery of silicon and silver, the studies said.Akanksha Tyagi, Programme Lead, CEEW, said, ""Solar recycling can be the bridge between India's clean energy and manufacturing ambitions. Beyond managing waste, it's an opportunity to innovate by designing panels for easier recovery, improving material purity and creating new value chains around critical minerals.""Introducing EPR targets, creating demand for circular products, improving data transparency and designing for recyclability could turn India's solar waste challenge into a green industry opportunity,"" she said.To enable large-scale adoption, the CEEW studies recommend EPR targets for collection and recovery under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, led by the Environment Ministry, and a Circular Solar Taskforce under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to align policy, finance and industry action.They also propose a centralised solar inventory to identify waste hotspots and urge producers to share material data and design modules for easy disassembly.","India is projected to generate about 11 million tonnes of solar waste by 2047, largely from crystalline-silicon modules.

India's marine mammal research set to advance with new acoustic tracking efforts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-marine-mammal-research-set-to-advance-with-new-acoustic-tracking-efforts/articleshow/125136234.cms,"India's marine mammal research could soon take a major leap forward with new initiatives to track whales, dolphins, and other species by capturing their sounds from several kilometres away.At a special session on marine mammal research, held alongside the fourth International Symposium on Marine Ecosystem (MECOS4) at the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, experts discussed the growing use of PAM-a sound-based technology that enables scientists to track marine mammals more effectively, a press release said on Thursday.According to experts, sound travels much faster and farther underwater than light, making acoustic monitoring an ideal tool to detect and study marine life even in challenging oceanic conditions.Unlike visual surveys that depend on clear weather and daylight, Passive Acoustic Monitoring offers round-the-clock monitoring across vast stretches of the ocean, the release said.""The technology uses various systems such as bottom-mounted moorings, surface buoys, drifting buoys, towed arrays, and even acoustic tags attached to individual animals,"" said Dr Divya Panicker of Ashoka University.These devices capture underwater sounds produced by marine mammals, helping researchers determine their presence, abundance, and distribution patterns.""By analysing these sound signals, scientists can even trace migration routes and behavioural patterns of species,"" she said, adding that integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) could further enhance the accuracy of species identification and classification.With India's vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, developing indigenous acoustic systems could revolutionise marine mammal conservation, the session observed.Amid growing concerns over the challenges faced by marine mammals along India's coasts, experts called for the formulation of a National Plan of Action for Marine Mammal Conservation to ensure long-term protection of these ecologically significant species.The discussions also highlighted that CMFRI's research on marine mammals recently helped India clear a major hurdle in seafood exports to the United States.Dr A Bijukumar, Vice-Chancellor of the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), who chaired the session, said, ""There is a need for a national multi-institutional marine mammal network to coordinate research, monitoring, and conservation activities across the country.""""India urgently needs a coordinated and well-funded conservation plan with defined roles for research institutions, enforcement agencies, and coastal communities,"" said CMFRI Director Dr Grinson George.He underscored the importance of allowing qualified marine scientists and research institutes to handle stranded marine mammals and conduct autopsies (post-mortem examinations) to determine causes of death, the release added.Dr J Jayasankar, Dr E Vivekanandan, Dr Sijo Varghese, Dr Isha Bopardikar, Dr Joice V Thomas, Dr Prajith, Dr Frances Gulland, Dr Dipani Sutaria, and Dr Ratheesh Kumar R also spoke at the session.","Passive acoustic monitoring offers round-the-clock monitoring across vast stretches of the ocean.

Fans accuse the romance of being staged and drag Taylor Swift into the discourse

More coverage on NFL:

Hollywood is rarely short of a headline-grabbing romance, but the Sydney Sweeney–Scooter Braun storyline has hit a different level of disbelief on social media. A new viral clip showing the pair kissing on a rock in New York’s Central Park sent the internet into defense mode and in 2025, few celebrity narratives spark skepticism faster than anything involving Braun.The rumored couple has reportedly been moving quickly since September, but fans are questioning everything from their chemistry to the timing. Many are convinced the relationship is built for cameras, not connection. And yes, because everything in pop culture eventually loops back to it, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s names have now been dragged into the conversation too.As the video circulated, the tone of the comments wasn’t playful, it was almost unanimously uncomfortable. One user wrote, “This looks so staged.. it’s awkward.” Another added, “Omg so performative.”And the one-liner that instantly went viral, “Definitely not on Taylor Swift's wedding list.” That single sentence reminded everyone that Braun still sits in the same pop-culture shadow that started when he purchased Swift’s masters. The moment fans referenced Taylor Swift, the relationship became more than just a maybe-celebrity fling, it became part of a larger cultural villain narrative.Braun has been photographed with Sweeney at events, reported yacht days, and private parties. Sources insist the romance has been “full throttle” since late September. But the internet isn’t buying the dream. They’re treating it like a PR sequence, especially with the timing aligning with her rising Hollywood earnings and his ongoing public image cleanup.Meanwhile, Swift, enjoying the softer, happier cultural reception of her real-life romance with Travis Kelce, remains the unspoken standard fans compare any Braun-centric storyline against. And in that comparison? The internet’s verdict is cold, sharp, and clear, if this new couple wants to be taken seriously, they’ll need more than park PDA.At this point, the backlash isn’t about a kiss, it’s about credibility. Until they show genuine connection beyond staged optics, the internet isn’t offering either of them the benefit of the doubt.",A viral clip of sydney sweeney and scooter braun kissing in central park has sparked widespread disbelief and accusations of a staged romance.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A life certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Brittany Mahomes sparks new breakup chatter after icy red carpet moment with Patrick Mahomes goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-sparks-new-breakup-chatter-after-icy-red-carpet-moment-with-patrick-mahomes-goes-viral/articleshow/125132657.cms,"Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are facing renewed divorce speculation fueled by social media's dissection of a single red carpet clip. Despite their decade-long relationship and three children, online users interpret perceived distance as evidence of marital trouble. Brittany has previously spoken about the challenges of dealing with other women pursuing her husband, but now claims to be unbothered.

Brittany Mahomes’ entire love-story history is getting dragged back up as fans dissect one red carpet moment

More coverage on NFL:

Being in the NFL inner circle is no longer just game days and VIP suites, it’s content consumption, nonstop fan theories, and dissected facial expressions frame by frame. Brittany Mahomes knows that better than almost anyone. Anyone who’s followed her marriage to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has watched the couple grow up in public, from teenage connection in Texas to NFL superstardom, but social media doesn’t care about their full arc.Instead, TikTok and X users zoom in on a few seconds of eye contact, a shift of posture, or a moment of distance and call it “evidence.” That’s how the latest round of divorce speculation began, off one clip that looked chilly, not affectionate.The couple attended the red carpet for ESPN’s 2025 docuseries “The Kingdom,” yet instead of celebrating the milestone, the internet became hyper-focused on how separate they appeared standing next to one another. They weren’t the PDA-heavy duo fans are used to and that silence between them was louder than any interview soundbite.Brittany has admitted publicly that she’s had to toughen up emotionally when other women shoot their shot at her husband.During a fan Q&A, she didn’t sugarcoat her frustration: “Lol it's actually really sad how disrespectful some women are...But they are a waist [sic] of my time & not going to disturb my peace.” She admitted she once struggled with it deeply, but now says, “But I did use to have a very hard time and get extremely annoyed. But I am now to a point where I could care less!”Here’s the reality, online rumor culture rewards worst-case scenarios. Brittany and Patrick have three children, a decade-long foundation, and a shared empire. A weird moment on a red carpet might simply be nerves, but social media would rather write fan fiction than believe in a calm marriage.Ultimately, unless Brittany or Patrick speak directly, internet detectives will keep projecting. In today’s celebrity climate, silence breeds theories and every quiet second becomes narrative fuel for strangers online.","Brittany and patrick mahomes are facing renewed divorce speculation.

Tyler Oliveira says backlash and threats forced him to cancel his film





YouTuber Tyler Oliveira said he will not release his documentary about India’s poop-throwing festival. He posted this on his X account two hours ago. Oliveira said he was doxxed and threatened by thousands of Indians after he filmed the event. He said people also targeted his family, turning his life “into a living hell.” The festival he filmed is called the Gorehabba cow-dung festival, celebrated in Gumatapura village in Karnataka after Diwali.In his post, Oliveira said he never meant to insult India’s culture or religion, but only wanted to show the unique tradition to the world. However, his short teaser video called “Inside India’s Poop-Throwing Festival” drew massive backlash online, with many Indians calling it offensive and disrespectful. After days of threats, Oliveira said he would stop and not publish the full documentary.Tyler Oliveira explained that he went to Gumatapura to film a local tradition where villagers throw dried cow dung as part of a festive ritual. The event is a real religious tradition connected to the worship of a local deity.Oliveira shared clips online wearing a protective suit, which quickly went viral. But the reaction was harsh, many people accused him of mocking Indian culture and showing it as a joke.In his long post, Tyler Oliveira said, “I have been doxxed and threatened by thousands of Indians. My family has been attacked in ways I never could have imagined.” He also added that he had underestimated India’s power and could not “fight against 1.5 billion people.”Oliveira said he was scared for his safety and his family’s safety. He also mentioned that visiting the festival was “the worst decision of [his] life.” He asked Indians to stop sending hate and said he only wanted to show the tradition to the world in a documentary.Many Indian news outlets reported on the issue, saying this shows how foreign creators must research and respect local customs before filming them. The Gorehabba festival has been celebrated for generations and is seen by villagers as a symbol of faith and togetherness, not a strange event.After the backlash, Tyler Oliveira said he would stop the project entirely. He said he could not continue this “war” and would move on to other work. He ended his message by saying, “I never meant to offend anyone. Please leave my family alone.”Also Read: Sneako Admires Zohran Mamdani And Wife Rama Duwaji’s Real Love And The Internet Falls For Their Charm",Youtuber tyler oliveira says he will not release his documentary about india's poop-throwing festival.

Her channel was first banned on October 24, 2025, after videos from a May 2024 live stream showed her and another streamer, Zoe Spencer, touching a production team member named Said without his consent. The incident led to serious accusations of sexual harassment and drew massive backlash across the Twitch community.At first, Twitch lifted Nina Lin’s ban just one day later, on October 25, which made many users angry. They felt the platform acted too quickly to forgive her. When more old clips surfaced showing similar behavior, Twitch banned her again on October 30. Now, after one week, her channel has been unbanned, but the controversy around her name still hasn’t gone away. Many viewers and streamers are still upset with Twitch, saying the company isn’t handling such serious behavior properly.Famous Twitch streamers like Disguised Toast and Valkyrae spoke out about Nina Lin’s actions and Twitch’s handling of the bans. Disguised Toast shared that he once felt uncomfortable when Nina Lin interrupted his massage during a sponsored event and touched him without permission.Valkyrae also said she felt uneasy watching the video of Nina and Zoe Spencer touching Said during the FaZe Clan live stream.Nina Lin later apologized during a live stream, saying she thought it was all a joke and did not mean to hurt anyone. But many viewers didn’t accept her apology, saying what happened was serious and not something to be laughed off.After her first ban was lifted too soon, many creators, including Disguised Toast, said Twitch needed to take such incidents more seriously. They asked for stricter rules to make sure everyone, creators, fans, and production staff, feel safe during live events.Also Read: Sneako Admires Zohran Mamdani And Wife Rama Duwaji’s Real Love And The Internet Falls For Their Charm Right now, Nina Lin’s channel is visible again, but it is still under review for breaking Twitch’s community guidelines.

Betting against Nvidia and Palantir: A $1 billion gamble

Reactions to Burry’s actions



The bigger picture: A potential AI market correction?







Michael Burry, the investor made famous by predicting the 2008 financial crisis, is back, this time betting against two of the most prominent companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) sector: Nvidia and Palantir. Known for spotting market bubbles before they burst, Burry believes the current AI boom could be the next bubble to pop. His controversial stance has reignited discussions about whether AI valuations have gotten out of hand. The hedge fund manager, portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 movie The Big Short, has placed nearly $1.1 billion in bearish bets on these two companies, sparking concerns that the AI market might be heading for a dramatic fall.Michael Burry’s return to social media has been anything but conventional. After a two-year break, the hedge fund manager behind Scion Asset Management resumed posting on X (formerly Twitter) on October 31, 2025, just two days before his fund’s quarterly filings revealed a massive bet against two of the hottest AI stocks: Nvidia and Palantir. His posts have ranged from ominous warnings and cryptic quotes to ""Star Wars"" memes references, all all centred around his belief that the AI market is in the midst of a dangerous bubble.Burry’s first warning came in the form of a statement he shared alongside an image of Christian Bale portraying him in The Big Short, the 2015 film that dramatized his prediction of the 2008 housing crash. The caption read:The last line is a direct reference to the 1983 movie WarGames, where a supercomputer runs countless simulations of nuclear war, only to find that all outcomes lead to mutual destruction. In the context of today’s stock market, Burry’s use of this quote suggests that the risks of investing in certain sectors, particularly AI, might be so great that it’s better to simply sit out.This post, made on October 31, 2023, marked Burry’s first return to X (formerly Twitter) after a two-year break.As part of his prophetic return, Burry also updated his profile picture with a still portrait of him and changed his bio on X to read:The reference to Cassandra, the cursed Trojan priestess who always spoke the truth but was never believed, highlights Burry’s long-standing reputation as an outsider. His predictions often seem so far-fetched and ahead of their time that they are met with skepticism, much like Cassandra’s warnings, which no one believed until it was too late.Continuing his rebellious stance, Burry also swapped his banner image on X to a still from Star Wars: A New Hope, featuring Obi-Wan Kenobi using his Jedi mind trick to deceive Imperial stormtroopers. This visual was a clear positioning of Burry as a lone figure fighting against the mainstream narrative, in this case, against the widespread optimism around AI.Burry revisited his Star Wars reference in a single follow-up post, where he shared two images. The first was a highlighted excerpt from, a book that discusses the. The passage he shared detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast swaths of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that ultimately scrambled for creditor protection. This reference was an attempt by Burry to draw a parallel between the telecom collapse of the late 1990s and the current state of AI, suggesting that today's AI infrastructure could suffer the same fate.The second image in the post was a still from Star Wars: A New Hope, featuring a stormtrooper. Burry captioned the slide with the words, “Move along,”As part of his critique of the current AI boom, Burry attached three slides to a post on X on November 4, a day after his filings were revealed. accompanied by the caption: ""These aren't the charts you are looking for. You can go about your business."" The images were intended to explain why Burry is bearish on the AI frenzy, drawing on visual data to support his concerns.The first slide was a chart showing a sharp slowdown in cloud computing growth among major companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. This chart illustrated how the growth rate of cloud services, a key driver of the tech sector, has steadily slowed in the last two years.The second slide highlighted a significant spike in capital expenditures (CapEx) across the US tech sector, particularly in the AI and cloud computing fields. This surge in spending, Burry noted, mirrored the unsustainable growth seen just before the dot-com crash of the late 1990s and the 2008 financial crisis. Companies investing aggressively in infrastructure without a clear path to profitability or return raised alarm bells for Burry, who has seen this kind of behavior lead to disastrous market corrections in the past.The third and final slide depicted the interconnected, circular dealmaking between AI companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, and Microsoft. Burry pointed out how these companies are increasingly intertwined in a web of interdependent partnerships and investments, a form of dealmaking that can create a self-reinforcing bubble. He warned that such arrangements could drive inflated valuations that eventually collapse when the bubble bursts.True to form, Burry backed up his warnings with action. In a regulatory filing revealed on Monday, November 3, the hedge fund manager’s firm, Scion Asset Management, disclosed two striking bearish bets placed during the previous quarter. Scion purchased put options on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares, with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively. The combined value of these positions is approximately $1.1 billion.To break this down for readers unfamiliar with the term: a put option is a financial contract that allows the buyer to sell shares at a predetermined price before a certain date. If the price of the stock falls, the put option becomes more valuable. Burry is essentially betting that the stock prices of Nvidia and Palantir will decline, and if they do, his options will pay off.This is a significant move, as Scion’s total US stock portfolio shrank from 15 positions at the end of June to just 8 positions by the end of September. Of these eight, the bets on Nvidia and Palantir account for the bulk of the portfolio, making up nearly $1 billion of Scion’s holdings. Burry’s move is a clear signal that he believes these companies’ massive valuations are unsustainable.In addition to these two major positions, Scion’s portfolio also includes stocks like Bristol-Myers Squibb, GeoGroup, and CVS Health. However, the bulk of the attention has been on Nvidia and Palantir due to their significant weight in his portfolio, and their role as symbols of the AI-driven market frenzy that Burry has warned against. The firm managed about $155 million as of March, per its latest regulatory filing.As expected, Burry’s bearish stance has caused a stir. Palantir CEO Alex Karp has since blasted the move, calling the decision to bet against AI ""batst crazy."" ""The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,"" Karp told CNBC.""The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats**t crazy. He’s actually putting a short on AI … It was us and Nvidia.""Meanwhile, analysts like James Kardatzke, co-founder of stock research platform Quiver Quantitative, pointed out that Burry’s track record of making large bearish bets when he perceives a market bubble is well-known. “Michael Burry has a history of making large bearish bets when he perceives there to be a bubble,” Kardatzke said. “This new disclosure suggests that he now believes there is an AI bubble which is due to pop. ”This kind of contrarian thinking is what made Burry famous in the first place. In 2008, he was one of the first to realise that the housing market was heading for disaster. He bet against the subprime mortgage market, making billions of dollars when the housing crisis finally hit. That story was immortalised in the book and movie The Big Short, with Christian Bale portraying Burry.Burry’s positions have sparked significant attention, not only because of the companies he’s betting against but also because they raise crucial questions about the future of artificial intelligence. The AI sector is undeniably booming, with valuations of $5 trillion for Nvidia, nearly $500 billion for Palantir, and a similar price tag for OpenAI. But Burry warns that these inflated valuations may be overestimating future growth, suggesting the market is pricing in an almost utopian level of success for these firms. If these companies fail to meet the sky-high expectations, their stock prices could suffer sharp declines, triggering a wider market correction.There are echoes of the dot-com bubble in Burry’s critique. Much like the late 1990s, when tech companies poured billions into building infrastructure that ultimately sat idle after the bubble burst, today’s AI giants are investing massive amounts of capital into creating vast, intricate systems—cloud networks, data centers, and AI tools, on the assumption that demand will continue to grow exponentially. But if that demand falls short or fails to materialize as projected, we could see a repeat of history: a market correction that drags down the sector and wider markets in its wake.Burry’s warnings echo his past actions. Back during the subprime mortgage crisis, he delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system.In one of his more philosophical statements, Burry reflected: ""We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes."" He added, ""Sober analysis on the part of the individual is paramount.""","Michael burry, famous for predicting the 2008 crisis, has placed a $1 billion bet against nvidia and palantir.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, ceo jensen huang said.

Microsoft and Amazon Web Services outages







Social media platform Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the US and India. The disruption affected thousands of users rendering them unable to use the platform, before the company successfully implemented a fix. At its peak, more than 20,000 reports of issues with Reddit were logged by users in the US alone, according to the outage-tracking website Downdetector. India also saw a significant spike, peaking at around 500 reports.Reddit quickly acknowledged the disruption on its status page and deployed corrective action.“The issue has been identified and a fix is being implemented. We are continuing to monitor for any further issues,” the company initially stated. About an hour later, the platform confirmed that the issue “has been resolved,” restoring service to affected users globally.The Reddit outage is the latest in a series of service disruptions across the technology sector.Recently, a massive outage in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing network caused widespread issues, hitting several major applications, including Reddit. That incident, which occurred on October 20, briefly disrupted a third of the internet after a Domain Name System (DNS) error at AWS’s Northern Virginia data center compromised the ability of apps to access their data.Additionally, Microsoft's Azure network also faced an outage last month that affected several websites, services and apps including Microsoft 365, Xbox and NatWest.Microsoft's Azure status page later confirmed problems with Azure Portal access. On its status page, Azure's network infrastructure was showing as “critical” in every region in the world, underscoring the global scale of the problem.Microsoft said it believed the outage was a result of ""an inadvertent configuration change"", and that it planned to remedy the situation by rolling the service back to a recent backup known to be functioning correctly.","Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the us and india.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long ai training period, ceo satya nadella announced.

IBM has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025. As reported by CNBC, this latest round of job cuts of the company will impact thousands of employees as the company continues to move towards high-margin software and artificial intelligence services. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” an IBM spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.”IBM has the global headcount of approximately 2,70,000 employees at the end of 2024, so if the company plans even to layoff 1% of its employees then it will impact around 2,700 employees.The upcoming round of layoffs comes as part of IBM’s broader organisational realignment under CEO Arvind Krishna. The software giant is now sharpening its focus on AI-driven cloud services and software as both the areas have shown strong growth. In its recent earnings report, IBM posted better-than-expected results, driven by a 10% increase in software revenue.A report by The Wall Street Journal revealed that earlier this year, IBM eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents.The company has since redirected hiring efforts toward sales and software development roles.This latest move by IBM mirrors the current trend in the tech industry, where companies are laying off staff in order to streamline operations and also boost productivity. Last month, e-commerce major Amazon announced its plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, whereas Facebook-parent Meta said that it would eliminated 600 roles in its AI division.Despite the layoffs, IBM still maintains its workforce in the US will remain stable year-over-year, suggesting that the job cuts may be more concentrated in international markets or non-core business units.While IBM has not yet disclosed the departments and regions affected by the upcoming job cuts, but emphasised that the restructuring is part of a long-term strategy to align its workforce with emerging growth areas. “We routinely review our workforce and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement.",Ibm has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.

Here's everything you need to know about OpenAI free ChatGPT Go offer, and a complete guide on how to redeem the deal.Eligibility for the promotion is restricted to users physically located in India. New ChatGPT users, current free-plan users, and existing ChatGPT Go subscribers with accounts in good standing can participate. However, users subscribed to other ChatGPT plans including Plus, Pro, Business, or Enterprise must first cancel their subscriptions and wait for their billing period to end before becoming eligible.A crucial requirement: all users must provide a payment method—either credit card or UPI—to enroll, though no subscription fees will be charged during the 12-month promotional period. Users selecting UPI may see a temporary charge of ₹1 per billing cycle, which will be refunded.This nominal charge is necessary for UPI payment processing purposes.Here are step-by-step guide to redeem free ChatGPT Go for 12 months on web, Android smartphones, and iPhones.Existing ChatGPT Go subscribers face different scenarios based on their original subscription platform. Those who initially subscribed through ChatGPT’s website or Google Play Store should not cancel their subscriptions. OpenAI will automatically extend their next billing date by 12 months within the coming week, provided their accounts remain in good standing.However, subscribers who originally signed up through Apple’s App Store face limitations due to Apple’s platform rules. These users must cancel their current subscription, wait until their billing period ends, and then re-subscribe during the promotional period—either through the App Store next week or immediately via web or Google Play.Note: users will still be charged for their current billing cycle if already in progress when the promotion launched. The 12-month free period only begins from the next billing cycle forward.ChatGPT Go is OpenAI’s low-cost subscription tier, positioned between the free plan and the premium Plus tier. The subscription includes extended access to GPT-5, OpenAI’s flagship model, along with increased usage limits for image generation capabilities.Subscribers gain enhanced access to file uploads for analysing documents and spreadsheets, advanced data analysis tools including Python for data exploration, and longer memory retention for more personalised conversations with larger context windows. The plan also provides access to projects for work organisation, task tracking features, and the ability to create and edit custom GPTs—personalised AI tools tailored to specific needs.Usage limits under ChatGPT Go, while higher than the free plan, may still vary based on system conditions to ensure smooth performance across OpenAI’s user base. The company states these limits apply to core chat functions and tools.Users who cancel before the promotion ends will lose access at the end of their current 30-day billing cycle and cannot redeem the offer again on the same account. The promotion remains available for a limited time, and OpenAI reserves the right to end it at any point without prior notice. Each account can redeem the offer only once during the promotional window, making the decision to participate a one-time opportunity for eligible users in India.After the 12-month promotional period concludes, OpenAI will automatically charge users the standard monthly ChatGPT Go fee, i.e. Rs 399, using their payment method on file unless they cancel before the billing cycle for the next month begins.","Chatgpt go is openai’s low-cost subscription tier, positioned between the free plan and the premium plus tier.
