PM Modi Will Soon Dedicate India’s 1st Made-In-India Semiconductor Chip From Sanand Plant: Vaishnaw





Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday received the country’s first made-in-India semiconductor chip at the inauguration of Semicon India 2025 in New Delhi.Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw presented the Vikram 32-bit processor, developed by Isro ’s Semiconductor Lab, along with test chips from four approved projects.According to news agency ANI, Vaishnaw said the achievement reflects the country’s rapid progress under the India Semiconductor Mission launched in 2021. “Just a few years ago, we met for the first time to make a new beginning driven by our Prime Minister’s farsighted vision. In a short span of 3.5 years, we have the world looking at India with confidence. Today, the construction of five Semiconductor units is going on at a rapid pace…We just presented the first ‘Made-in-India’ chip to PM Modi,” he stated.Vaishnaw added that despite global policy turmoil, India has emerged as a “lighthouse of stability and growth.”The Vikram processor, fully indigenous, has been qualified for use in harsh launch vehicle conditions, ANI reported.The minister highlighted India’s semiconductor ecosystem push, including the Rs 76,000 crore Production Linked Incentive scheme, of which nearly Rs 65,000 crore has already been committed.He also referred to the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) Pilot Line Facility launched in Sanand, Gujarat, with CG-Semi expected to roll out chips soon.As per ANI, the government has sanctioned 23 design projects under the Design Linked Incentive scheme, while 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.6 lakh crore have been approved across Gujarat, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.Industry leaders also hailed India’s growing role. Tim Archer, CEO of Lam Research, said India is laying the foundation for a “resilient semiconductor ecosystem” as the global market moves toward the $1 trillion mark.Kai Beckmann of Merck projected India’s local semiconductor market would reach $100 billion by 2030, while AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company’s $400 million India investment plan announced at last year’s Semicon event.Beckmann stressed collaboration, calling semiconductors a “team sport,” while Papermaster praised India’s “extraordinary talent base” and government backing.The three-day Semicon India 2025 aims to position India as a global hub for chip design, manufacturing, and innovation, focusing on building a robust and sustainable ecosystem, ANI reported.","Pm modi receives first made-in-india chip at semicon india 2025 in new delhi.

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India’s strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, “India is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.”Global technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world’s leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work — translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a “boss versus worker” setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India’s policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India’s semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. “We consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,” Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “soon” dedicate the country’s first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India’s semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, according to a report by bastion research.

Carey Price’s wife responds to speculation about his contract



A candid message of realism and loyalty to the Canadiens



The uncertainty surrounding Carey Price’s future in Montreal has taken an emotional turn, with his wife Angela Price offering her candid perspective. The legendary goaltender hasn’t played since 2022 due to a lingering knee injury, yet his $10.5 million contract continues to weigh heavily on the Canadiens’ salary cap. Now, as speculation builds about the team moving his deal, Angela’s words reflect both realism and loyalty.Price’s absence has been deeply felt by the Canadiens and their fans. Once the backbone of Montreal’s remarkable run to the 2021 Stanley Cup Final, the former MVP has struggled to return to the crease. With the Canadiens already stretched above the salary cap, trading his contract seems inevitable.When asked about the possibility, Angela Price didn’t shy away from honesty: “Probably the same way most of Montreal would feel… but ultimately you want what’s best for the team.”Her response captures a sentiment many in Montreal share. While the idea of severing ties with a franchise icon may sting, the business side of hockey often leaves little room for sentimentality.Throughout his career, Carey Price embodied loyalty to Montreal. Even when Jaroslav Halak briefly stole the spotlight during the 2010 playoffs, Price persevered and reclaimed his starting role. That resilience carried him to legendary status, culminating in his Hart Trophy win as NHL MVP in 2015 — the first Canadiens goalie to do so since José Théodore.Yet, the present reality is harsher. With a contract too large for a sidelined player, management’s decision will be driven by cap space and long-term planning rather than legacy. Angela Price’s remarks remind fans that sometimes love for the team means embracing tough choices.If and when the Canadiens move on from Price’s deal, it won’t erase his impact. Instead, it will underscore the delicate balance between heart and business that defines professional sports.Also Read: NHL insiders suggest Penguins are preparing a fire sale while Sidney Crosby rumors continue to swirl","Carey price hasn’t played since 2022 due to a lingering knee injury.

Calgary Flames making progress toward three-year contract with RFA Connor Zary

The Fourth Period

“getting closer”

Connor Zary’s role with Calgary Flames heading into 2025-26 season

The Calgary Flames are moving closer to resolving their last major piece of offseason business. According to David Pagnotta of The Fourth Period, restricted free agent forward Connor Zary is expected to sign a three-year contract worth roughly $3.5 million per season. With the deal nearly finalized, the Flames are set to enter training camp with their roster intact and more than enough salary cap flexibility.Zary’s new contract would mark the end of one of the longer RFA negotiations of the summer. Calgary initially aimed for a medium-term commitment, and talks are now tracking toward a three-year agreement that fits both sides. As David Pagnotta ofreported Tuesday, the two sides areto finalizing terms after steady progress in recent weeks.Cap space has not been an obstacle, Calgary still has over $15 million in room for opening night, per PuckPedia, with Zary the only unsigned piece remaining. The deal would secure Zary’s place in Calgary’s lineup through the 2027-28 season, keeping him under team control until he becomes eligible for unrestricted free agency. A $3.5 million cap hit aligns with AFP Analytics’ projections from earlier in the offseason, making it a predictable but important step for the Flames.The 23-year-old forward has had a mixed start to his NHL career. After producing 34 points in 63 games during his rookie year, he posted 27 points in 54 appearances last season. His progress was slowed by two lower-body injuries, including a knee issue that ended his campaign prematurely. Despite that setback, Zary has shown steady growth and earned top-nine responsibilities, averaging over 16 minutes of ice time per game.Calgary will enter training camp without significant changes to their forward group, leaving Zary in line for a consistent role. Whether skating alongside Mikael Backlund or Nazem Kadri, he is expected to continue his development in a top-six capacity. A first-round pick in 2020, Zary turns 24 later this month and remains on track to become an important long-term contributor.With a new deal close to being finalized, the Flames and Connor Zary are set to put an end to lengthy RFA talks. The contract offers financial stability for the player while giving Calgary cost certainty for the next three seasons. Now, the focus shifts from negotiations to on-ice performance as Zary looks to build on his potential in 2025-26.Also Read: Carey Price trade talks heat up as San Jose Sharks emerge as front-runners in NHL rumors",Calgary flames and rfa connor zary are close to signing a three-year contract.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shares 5 ChatGPT prompts he swears by for daily work that show what’s now possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-shares-5-chatgpt-prompts-he-swears-by-for-daily-work-that-show-whats-now-possible/articleshow/123559941.cms,"Satya Nadella’s 5 ChatGPT prompts for daily workflow

1. Predict key discussion points for meetings



2. Draft comprehensive project updates



3. Assess product launch readiness



4. Categorize time and focus areas



5. Prepare for specific meetings

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports. By leveraging GPT-5 for project updates, Nadella ensures faster, more accurate reporting while freeing time for higher-level strategic thinking.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines. These prompts illustrate how AI is moving from a supportive tool to a central decision-making partner in modern leadership.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities. By identifying time sinks, GPT-5 ensures leaders avoid burnout and maximize efficiency. It also helps executives quickly see if their time matches organizational goals.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently. This proactive support reduces time spent digging through notes or inboxes. It ensures that meetings are focused, productive, and strategically aligned.Nadella’s use of GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot reflects a broader trend toward AI-powered workflows. By automating routine tasks, analyzing complex data, and generating actionable insights, AI can save time, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. Many companies are now exploring similar AI-driven integrations to streamline workflows and boost productivity across multiple levels of their organizations. As organizations continue to integrate tools like GPT-5, executives and teams alike can leverage AI to focus on higher-value work while staying informed, organized, and proactive. This approach also fosters a culture of data-driven decision-making, empowering employees to take informed actions quickly. Additionally, it helps bridge communication gaps between departments by providing shared insights and context in real time.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella has highlighted how gpt-5, integrated into microsoft 365 copilot, has become an essential part of his daily workflow.

From skepticism to ubiquity



Microsoft co-founder and once the world’s richest man Bill Gates is again making headlines. A clip from 1995 has again surfaced online showing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates being laughed at during a live interview for his bold predictions about the Internet. The viral clip doing the rounds of the internet is from The Late Show with David Letterman . In the clip Gates was seen being laughed at for trying to explain the potential of the internet.On November 27, 1995, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates appeared on The Late Show to talk about the internet. Speaking about it, Bill Gates addressed the internet as the ‘new big thing’. Gates explained that people will be able to publish information, create homepage and also send electronic mail using internet. However, the host of the show responded with mockery and compared the features of the internet with the then available technologies.“You could listen to a baseball game on your computer,” Gates said. Letterman shot back, “Does radio ring a bell?” prompting laughter from the audience. Bill Gates clarified that users could listen to games anytime, to which Letterman replied, “Do tape recorders ring a bell?”Along with this, Bill Gates also talked about internet’s ability to connect people with niche interests also offer continuous updated information. Letterman dismissed the idea with a joke about ‘loner chat rooms’ underscoring how unfamiliar and unnecessary the internet seemed at the time.The clip, recently shared by tech-focused social media pages, has been praised for its “wholesome” and “innocent” tone. But more importantly, it serves as a reminder that even the most transformative innovations often sound ridiculous before they become indispensable.All the features that Bill Gates described back then have now become a reality.

Marc Benioff's July stance on AI unemployment vs. September reality

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions, reducing its support workforce from 9,000 to 5,000 employees as AI agents increasingly handle customer service tasks. The dramatic workforce reduction represents nearly a 45% cut in the support division at the cloud software company.""I was able to rebalance my head count on my support,"" Benioff said during an appearance on the "" Logan Bartlett "" podcast released Friday, as quoted in a Business Insider report. ""I've reduced it from 9,000 heads to about 5,000 because I need less heads.""The job cuts come as Salesforce deploys AI agents that now handle 50% of customer conversations, with human agents managing the remaining half. Benioff described it as ""eight of the most exciting months of my career"" while explaining how AI technology has transformed the company's operations.The implementation extends beyond customer support into sales operations, where AI agents are addressing a significant backlog. Benioff revealed that Salesforce had accumulated over 100 million uncalled sales leads over 26 years due to insufficient staffing.""There were more than 100 million leads that we have not called back at Salesforce in the last 26 years because we have not had enough people,"" he explained. ""But we now have an agentic sales that is calling back every person that contacts us.""The company uses an ""omnichannel supervisor"" system that coordinates collaboration between human and AI agents, allowing AI to recognise when tasks require human intervention.Benioff compared this handoff process to Tesla's self-driving feature, explaining that AI agents can determine when they need human assistance, similar to how ""you're in your Tesla and all of a sudden it's self-driving and goes, 'Oh, I don't know actually know what's happening, you take over.'""The workforce reduction marks a stark contrast to Benioff's July 2025 statements, when he argued that AI wouldn't lead to mass unemployment. In a Fortune interview, he emphasized that AI would augment rather than replace workers, stating ""the humans are not going away"" and dismissing ""scary narratives"" about AI layoffs.Just two months earlier, Benioff had positioned himself against AI startup CEOs like Anthropic's Dario Amodei who predicted massive white-collar displacement. He argued that AI's current accuracy limitations, around 90% even with company data, meant ""you need the human in the loop."" Benioff insisted that while AI enhances productivity, it doesn't replace workers because ""AIs can't fact check because they don't have that level of accuracy.""The Salesforce CEO had even announced in July that the company wouldn't hire additional software engineers, customer service agents, or lawyers, but was adding sales staff to help customers adopt AI technology. Salesforce employed 76,453 people across all divisions as of January 2025, making the 4,000 support cuts represent roughly 5% of the total workforce.","Salesforce ceo marc benioff announced the company has cut 4,000 customer support positions.

Meta AI head Alexandr Wang's memo to employees on massive AI restructure makes one thing clear: Everyone will ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-head-alexandr-wangs-memo-to-employees-on-massive-ai-restructure-makes-one-thing-clear-everyone-will-report-to-wang/articleshow/123598963.cms,"From Scale AI to Meta’s AI architect

Read Alexandr Wang's full memo here

Superintelligence is coming, and in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product and infra. We are building a world-class organization around these areas, and have brought in some incredible leaders to drive the work forward.

As we previously announced, Shengjia Zhao will direct our research efforts as Chief Scientist for MSL, Nat Friedman will lead our product effort and Rob Fergus will continue to lead FAIR. Today, I'm pleased to announce that Aparna Ramani will be moving over to MSL to lead the infrastructure necessary to support our ambitious research and product bets.

As part of this, we are dissolving the AGI Foundations organization and moving the talent from that team into the right areas. Teams whose work naturally aligns with and serves our products will move to Nat's team. Some of the researchers will move to FAIR to double down on our long term research while teams working on infra will transition into Aparna's org. Anyone who is changing teams will get an update from their manager or HRBP today, if you haven't already.

We're making three key changes to our organizational design that will help us to accelerate our efforts.

Centralizing core, fundamental research efforts in TBD Lab and FAIR. Bolstering our product efforts with applied research that will work on product-focused models. Establishing a unified, core infrastructure team to support our research bets.

The work will map to four teams:

TBD Lab will be a small team focused on training and scaling large models to achieve superintelligence across pre-training, reasoning, and post-training, and explore new directions such as an omni model.

FAIR will be an innovation engine for MSL and we will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab. Rob will continue to lead FAIR and Yann will continue to serve as Chief Scientist for FAIR, with both reporting to me.

Products & Applied Research will bring our product-focused research efforts closer to product development. This will include teams previously working on Assistant, Voice, Media, Trust, Embodiment and Developer pillars in AI Tech. Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me.

MSL Infra team will unify elements of Infra and MSL's infrastructure teams into one. This team will focus on accelerating AI research and production by building advanced infrastructure, optimized GPU clusters, comprehensive environments, data infrastructure, and developer tools to support state-of-the-art research, products and AI development across Meta. Aparna will lead this team reporting to me.

Ahmad and Amir will continue reporting to me focusing on strategic MSL initiatives they will share more about later.

I recognize that org changes can be disruptive, but I truly believe that taking the time to get this structure right now will allow us to reach superintelligence with more velocity over the long term. We're still working through updated rhythms and our collaboration model across teams, including when we'll come together as a full MSL org.

Thank you all for your flexibility as we adapt to this new structure. Every team in MSL plays a critical role and I'm excited to get to work with all of you.

In a new and dramatic move, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making the most aggressive move in his AI arm race. Zuckerberg is now reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL) into four distinct teams. As reported by Business Insider the company outlined the move in an internal memo from the newly appointed chief of AI Alexandr Wang. The internal email, sent by Alexandr Wang , the 28-year-old head of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), outlines a dramatic restructuring aimed at accelerating Meta’s pursuit of “personal superintelligence”—AI that can outperform humans across intellectual domains.According to a report by Business Insider, the reorganization splits the company’s AI efforts into four specialized teams—TBD Lab, FAIR, Products & Applied Research, and MSL Infra. However, another important update shared in the memo revealed that nearly all the senior leaders in Meta’s AI ecosystem will now directly report to Wang. This list also includes high-profile hires like former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who will lead product integration, and engineering veteran Aparna Ramani, who will oversee infrastructure.Alexandr Wang, founder of the AI startup ScaleAI shared a bold mandate in order to accelerate Meta’s race toward superintelligence. His memo dissolves the AGI Foundations group and redistributes its talent across the new structure, emphasizing speed, clarity, and centralized execution. “Superintelligence is coming,” Wang wrote. “And in order to take it seriously, we need to organize around the key areas that will be critical to reach it — research, product, and infra”.The memo marks a clear consolidation of power and vision under Wang, reflecting Meta’s urgency to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google.",Meta ceo mark zuckerberg is reorganising the company’s artificial intelligence operations by restricting the meta superintelligence labs (msl) into four distinct teams.

AI transformation requires companies to fundamentally rewire operations

When Accenture CEO Julie Sweet needed to announce the largest organizational restructure in the consulting giant's history, she deliberately chose not to send a company-wide memo to her 770,000-person workforce. Instead, Sweet opted for a direct video message to communicate the sweeping changes across 120 countries, breaking decades of corporate tradition.""Reading it on a piece of paper would not have conveyed the why in the same way as hearing it—hearing the excitement in my voice, understanding the passion we have for why we're changing,"" Sweet told Fortune in a recent interview.The Dublin-based company, which generated $64.9 billion in fiscal 2024, serves more than 9,000 clients worldwide.

Anna Wintour taps Chloe Malle as Vogue successor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anna-wintour-taps-chloe-malle-as-vogue-successor-but-shes-still-in-charge/articleshow/123667594.cms,"



NEW YORK: Anna Wintour ended weeks of fashion-world speculation Tuesday when she named Chloe Malle her successor as head of editorial content at Vogue - but the most powerful person in the business isn't going anywhere.Wintour, 75, remains chief content officer for Conde Nast and global editorial director of American Vogue and the magazine's 27 other editions. Malle, editor of Vogue.com, may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day editorial and creative operations at the U.S. edition. And gone is the storied ""editor-in-chief"" title that Wintour held for nearly 40 years.Malle, 39, is the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and the late French director Louis Malle. She joined Vogue as social editor in 2011, moved on to contributing editor in 2016 and has held her current position since 2023. She steered all digital content for Vogue. In June, Malle interviewed the then-Lauren Sanchez ahead of her wedding to Jeff Bezos.""Vogue has already shaped who I am, now I'm excited at the prospect of shaping Vogue,"" Malle said in the announcement.Malle had emerged as a front-runner Since late June, when Wintour told staff that she was giving up her title, a handful of names to succeed her were tossed around. Among them were Eva Chen, vice president of fashion partnerships at Meta; Nicole Phelps, global director of Vogue Runway and Vogue Business; and Sara Moonves, editor-in-chief of W magazine.Other names that floated about soon after the job went up for grabs are Vogue's fashion news director Mark Holgate, British Vogue's head of editorial content Chioma Nnadi and Vogue.com's digital style director Leah Faye Cooper. Malle and Nnadi co-host the Vogue podcast, ""The Run-Through with Vogue.""The news that Malle got the job comes ahead of the latest round of shows at New York Fashion Week, starting next week, and amid the Venice Film Festival, which includes a new documentary about her father. Her appointment is effective immediately. Malle's mother, funnily enough, once played Vogue editor-in-chief Enid Frick on ""Sex and the City"" with some very Wintour-like characteristics.Malle, a Brown graduate and mother of two young kids, has been outspoken about her liberal-leaning politics, just as Wintour has.""I actually love working with Anna, because I love someone telling me exactly what needs to be done and exactly what she thinks about something,"" Malle said in a recent profile by the Independent. ""There's no indecision. There's no ambiguity.""Vogue's past, and future Vogue was founded as a society journal 134 years ago. After Conde Nast acquired it in 1909, it became a traditional industry mainstay with models on the cover, static close-up photography done in studios and a focus on high fashion and heavy makeup.Wintour, a risk-taker who took over the title in 1988, saw the mass appeal in a broader approach. She expanded international editions, elevated fashion's connections to pop culture and began putting celebrities, athletes, music stars and politicians on the covers. Wintour went for a high-low approach to fashion and favored storytelling in photo shoots done outdoors.She embraced then-emerging designers, including Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen, through initiatives like the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. And she transformed the Met Gala from a small, private fundraiser to a global event and fashion's most important night.Considered the fashion bible, American Vogue has had several notable editors throughout its history. Preceding Wintour were Diana Vreeland (1963 to 1971) and Grace Mirabella (1971 to 1988), among others.""Chloe has proven often that she can find the balance between American Vogue's long, singular history and its future on the front lines of the new,"" Wintour said in the statement on Malle's appointment.Under Malle's leadership, direct traffic to Vogue.com doubled, with massive growth across all key metrics, according to the statement on her new job. Site traffic now consistently reaches 14.5 million unique visitors monthly.The retirement of the editor-in-chief title brings Vogue in line with changes throughout the Conde Nast universe. When Radhika Jones stepped down as Vanity Fair's editor-in-chief earlier this year, her role was replaced by a ""global editorial director,"" found in Mark Guiducci. (Guiducci himself was tapped from Vogue, where he served most recently as creative editorial director.) American Vogue joins most every market where Conde Nast operates in the change to a head of editorial content, who reports to a global editorial director.Though Vogue has editions spanning the world, from Britain and France to China and India, Malle's focus will be on American Vogue.Anna Wintour's own future As Conde Nast's chief content officer, Wintour will continue to oversee every brand, including Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, GQ, AD, Conde Nast Traveler, Glamour, Bon Appetit, Tatler, World of Interiors, Allure and more, with the exception of The New Yorker, where editor David Remnick retains control.Wintour herself does have a boss. She reports to Roger Lynch, CEO of Conde Nast.""In effect, the addition of a new editorial lead for Vogue US will allow Wintour greater time and flexibility to support the other global markets that Conde Nast serves,"" said a Vogue statement in June.""And it goes without saying,"" Wintour joked back then, ""that I plan to remain Vogue's tennis and theater editor in perpetuity."" She's been a regular at this year's US Open, as in past years.She'll remain at the helm of the annual Met Gala, a major fundraiser for the fashion wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And she'll stay involved in Vogue World, a traveling fashion and cultural event the magazine began in 2022.Wintour explained the editor-in-chief shift this way:""Anybody in a creative field knows how essential it is never to stop growing in one's work. When I became the editor of Vogue, I was eager to prove to all who might listen that there was a new, exciting way to imagine an American fashion magazine,"" she told staff.""Now, I find that my greatest pleasure is helping the next generation of impassioned editors storm the field with their own ideas, supported by a new, exciting view of what a major media company can be,"" she said.","Anna wintour named chloe malle her successor as head of editorial content at vogue.

Landmark ruling: Judge blocks Google breakup but forces search overhaul in latest order– What it says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/landmark-ruling-judge-blocks-google-breakup-but-forces-search-overhaul-in-latest-order-what-it-says/articleshow/123664418.cms,"Representative image (AP)





A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a major restructuring of Google’s search engine in an effort to curb what he described as the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly, but stopped short of breaking up the tech giant.US district Judge Amit Mehta, in Washington, DC, issued a 226-page ruling aimed at restraining some of Google’s tactics used to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.The judge ordered Google to give both current and potential competitors access to some of its proprietary search data — the information collected from trillions of queries that helps improve the accuracy and quality of its search results.However, Mehta rejected the U.S. Justice Department’s request to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser and declined to ban the multi-billion-dollar agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on smartphones, personal computers, and other devices. These deals, which bring in more than $26 billion annually, were a central point in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.The ruling comes at a time when the tech industry is being reshaped by artificial intelligence innovations, including conversational “answer engines” from companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity, which are challenging Google’s dominance as the primary gateway to the internet.While the judge stopped short of a breakup, the decision signals a significant regulatory intervention in one of the world’s largest technology companies, balancing efforts to foster competition with concerns about disrupting a key player in the global digital economy.",Us district judge amit mehta issued a 226-page ruling aimed at restraining some of google’s tactics used to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.

"Old tech, new power? Why Britain is turning to flywheels for grid stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/old-tech-new-power-why-britain-is-turning-to-flywheels-for-grid-stability-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-system/articleshow/123611558.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny





Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out and replaced with renewable energy. Grid operators are increasingly relying on heavy spinning devices called flywheels to provide the inertia once supplied by fossil-fuel power stations, in order to prevent large-scale blackouts.Flywheels, used for centuries in machinery from potters’ wheels to steam engines, can mimic the stabilising effect of turbines in coal and gas plants by responding to sudden fluctuations in electricity supply and demand. Without such rotating systems, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise,"" said David Brayshaw, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. ""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" he told AFP.The challenge was underscored in April, when Spain and Portugal were hit by a major outage after their renewable-heavy grid failed to absorb a sudden surge in voltage. A similar incident in 2019 plunged parts of Britain into darkness and prompted the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to begin contracting grid-stabilising projects.Among the solutions, flywheels and batteries are being deployed to create “synthetic inertia”.According to engineering professor Keith Pullen of City St George's, University of London, steel flywheels could prove more cost-effective and longer-lasting than lithium-ion batteries. ""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, who also leads the startup Levistor.One of the flagship projects is Statkraft’s “Greener Grid Park” in Liverpool, operational since 2023. It uses two 40-ton flywheels attached to synchronous compensators to supply about one percent of Britain’s total grid inertia. ""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft’s head of zero-carbon grid solutions. NESO reports that at least 11 similar projects are already operational across the UK, with more on the way.Despite this progress, concerns remain. ""We aren't building them fast enough to decarbonise the grid,"" Nicholson warned, noting Britain’s target of 95 percent clean energy by 2030. ""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" he added, pointing out that gas turbines are still required to keep the grid stable.The government insists it is working with industry to scale up new stabilisation technologies. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the UK is collaborating with partners to roll out “world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system.”Still, experts say Britain and Ireland remain ahead of continental Europe in adopting such measures. ""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that. I think these things are driven by events.
