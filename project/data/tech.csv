Silver market jitters: ETFs see steep 20% drop; what’s causing the sudden drop?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-jitters-etfs-see-steep-20-drop-whats-causing-the-sudden-drop/articleshow/127124650.cms,"Representative image

Indian silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed a sharp sell-off on Thursday, plunging up to 20% in early trade as investors rushed to exit amid heightened volatility in precious metals.The steep fall wiped out the unusually high premium at which these ETFs were trading compared to international prices and physical silver markets.Nippon India Silver ETF, ICICI Prudential Silver ETF and Kotak Silver ETF fell between 19% and 20% during morning trade.As per ET, the funds slipped below their indicative net asset values (iNAVs), turning what was earlier a steep premium into a discount. The sell-off was largely limited to ETFs, highlighting the risks associated with sharp price dislocations in these products.In contrast, silver prices in other markets saw relatively modest declines. Global spot silver was trading around $92.27 an ounce, just days after touching a record high of $95.87 earlier this week.On the domestic front, MCX March silver futures slipped about 2% in morning trade, far less severe than the ETF correction.Market experts pointed to extreme volatility as a key factor behind the move. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart said investors should avoid fresh positions in precious metals for now.“We are experiencing very high price volatility in both precious metals,” Jain was quoted as saying by ET, advising traders to wait for stability.The correction came as global risk appetite improved and the US dollar strengthened, reducing demand for safe-haven assets.Sentiment also eased after US President Donald Trump ruled out using military force over Greenland and signalled restraint on tariffs against European nations.Despite the turbulence, some analysts remain constructive on silver’s broader outlook. Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, said COMEX silver remains firm near $92–$93, supported by strong industrial demand and tight global supply.However, he cautioned that near-term swings could remain sharp, especially in ETF prices, given their tendency to trade at premiums or discounts during volatile phases.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own.

EU, India To Sign Security And Defence Pact In New Delhi, Aim To Conclude FTA Talks: Kaja Kallas

With traditional security models unable to control AI-powered cyberattacks, 63SATS Cybertech, part of 63 moons technologies, has built a software platform for smartphone users along with an embedded comprehensive insurance to achieve cybersecurity and a financial safety net across India.The cybersecurity services firm merged software security and cyber insurance in to one active digital defense super app, CYBX, for everyday mobile users.Apart from controlling cyber threats, risks, and frauds, 63SATS Cybertech has also tied up with general insurer ICICI Lombard to provide a financial safety net to its cybersecurity app users.Elaborating on the depth of cybersecurity solutions, 63SATS Cybertech, Joint MD and Joint CEO Srinivas L said Indian smartphone users can now access exchange-grade security coupled with a financial safety net of up to Rs 10 lakh.""With protection offered for more than 100 threats, including covering digital safety, financial frauds, privacy protection, identity monitoring, and network security, our super app CYBX aims to democratise cybersecurity for every Indian household,"" he told PTI.He explained that CYBX acts as a digital companion and a silent sniper, operating discreetly on a smartphone to identify phishing links, malicious apps, and unsafe public Wi-Fi networks that could put one's data at risk.""It also helps safeguard call privacy by notifying the user about unauthorised call recording or being put on speakerphone, ensuring conversations stay private,"" he added.Noting that the domestic digital economy grows and vulnerabilities skyrocket side-by-side, Srinivas said, ""the app ensures 360-degree security for commoners. Interestingly, we provide in-built cyber insurance, an India-first mobile cybersecurity policy, covering from Rs 10,000, Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.""A cybersecurity technology platform with financial safety cover is a twin benefit for every personal smartphone user, which ensures every Indian can afford protection, he stated.The cyber insurance covers losses from online shopping and identity theft, as well as privacy and data breach liability, media and social media liability, theft of funds, losses resulting from cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and loss of reputation due to these incidents, among others.However, the insurer will not cover claims arising from events known to the insured before the policy start date, losses involving cryptocurrencies and gambling-related activities, among other activities.Srinivas said the company targets to make digital safety a daily habit on the back of CYBX with cyber insurance.","63sats cybertech has built a software platform for smartphone users along with an embedded comprehensive insurance to achieve cybersecurity and a financial safety net across india.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

“It’s a death sentence”: MrBeast warns fans that slow photo requests can turn dangerous in seconds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/its-a-death-sentence-mrbeast-warns-fans-that-slow-photo-requests-can-turn-dangerous-in-seconds/articleshow/127111141.cms,"MrBeast says taking photos with fans in public can quickly spiral into chaos if not done fast.

Why MrBeast believes taking photos with fans in public can spiral out of control

MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) Had A Problem With Steve-O | Wild Ride #277





Fame looks glamorous from the outside, but for Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, even a simple trip to a store can spiral into chaos within seconds. The world’s most-followed YouTuber has now revealed why a harmless fan photo can quickly turn into what he bluntly calls a “death sentence” in public places.Donaldson’s reach is unmatched. His videos rack up tens of millions of views in days, and his brand stretches far beyond YouTube into food, entertainment, and big-budget productions. That level of visibility, however, comes with a cost. One pause. One photo taken the wrong way. And suddenly, the crowd multiplies.Speaking on Steve-O’s Wildride! podcast, Donaldson explained that fan encounters only work if they are fast and controlled. The moment hesitation creeps in, things snowball. As he put it, ""If someone asks you for a photo and you go yes and then you let them hand the phone to their mom, you’re cooked. It’s like a fking flare in the middle of Walmart for everyone to start lining up, just ruining our trip.""The problem is not fans. It is human nature. When people see one photo happening, curiosity kicks in. Phones come out. Lines form. And suddenly, a casual outing becomes unmanageable.Donaldson made that clear when he added, ""You have to understand, it’s a death sentence if it’s not quick because, again, when you take photos in public, it causes everyone to turn and look, and lines form, and then it just gets bad because once a line forms, people just want a photo because other people are getting a photo.""His solution is simple and rehearsed. He grabs the phone himself, snaps the picture instantly, and moves on. It is not rudeness. It is survival. Donaldson stressed this point, saying, ""We like our fans and we’re not pieces of s*it, it’s just a factual thing. If we don’t take it quick enough, things just go bad, and it’s something that’s very hard to understand, but you’ve just got to take our word for it.""At planned events, he happily takes thousands of photos for hours. In public spaces, though, speed is everything. Fame, it turns out, leaves no room for small talk.","Mrbeast says taking photos with fans in public can quickly spiral into chaos.

Blinkit CEO Albinder Singh Dhindsa will take over as CEO. Goyal will transition to a non-executive Director and Vice Chairman role, pending shareholder approval, to maintain focus on Eternal's growth while exploring new ventures.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

”

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.""

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella spoke at world economic forum's annual meeting in davos, switzerland.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in.

Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr wang, meta's highest-paid employee, finds mark zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

“Speed Does Africa”

iShowSpeed says Africa tour prioritizes culture over influencer collabs





Popular streamer iShowSpeed has finally reacted to the criticism that he has been disrespecting local content creators in the ongoing Africa tour. The backlash started after several Nigerian content creators came forward with claims that Speed had completely ignored requests for collaboration as he visited Lagos. Clips of the criticism quickly spread online, with some influencers suggesting that Speed intentionally snubbed them. As the debate grew, many fans and creators alike questioned why one of the world's biggest streamers would travel through Africa without linking up with well-known local personalities.Addressing the situation directly, Speed explained that the goal of histour is being misunderstood. He said the tour is not designed around streamer meetups or influencer collaborations. Instead, the focus is on showcasing African culture, everyday people, and local talent that rarely gets global exposure. According to Speed, many of the creators criticizing him already have established platforms, while the tour is meant to shine a light on people who do not normally get seen.Speed clarified that every stop on the tour is tightly planned by his crew. Each day follows a strict schedule with limited time windows, specific locations, and pre-arranged cultural visits.Because of this, he said it is not possible to add last-minute collaborations, even if the requests come from popular creators. He also stressed that canceling or cutting short cultural moments arranged by local communities would be disrespectful to the people hosting him.The streamer added that similar criticism surfaced earlier in the tour, including during his visit to South Africa. In those cases, he said some creators felt overlooked, but he remained focused on the tour’s original purpose. Speed emphasized that the trip is about street performers, local artists, and communities with real talent who rarely receive attention on global platforms.The fans who have been supporting Speed have applauded him for his actions, stating that it helps to give a real image of the African nations. Most of the fans have applauded Speed for this, stating that it gives fans a true idea of life in these African nations. Speed’s quotes have been making their way around social media, and many have praised him for standing by his mission.As the 28-day tour continues across 20 African countries, Speed has made it clear that his focus will not change. While creator collaborations may happen naturally if time allows, he says the heart of the journey is about culture, people, and stories, not influencer appearances.",Streamer ishowspeed has finally reacted to the criticism that he has been disrespecting local content creators in the ongoing africa tour.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women, according to separate estimates of X data by the New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Starting in late Dec, users on the social media platform inundated the chatbot’s X account with requests to alter real photos of women and children to remove their clothes, put them in bikinis and pose them in sexual positions, prompting a global outcry from victims and regulators.In just nine days, Grok posted more than 4.4 million images. A review by NYT conservatively estimated that at least 41% of posts, or 1.8 million, most likely contained sexualised imagery of women. A broader analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, using a statistical model, estimated that 65%, or over three million, contained sexualised imagery of men, women or kids.The findings show how quickly Grok spread disturbing images, which earlier prompted govts in Britain, India, Malaysia and the US to start investigations into whether the images violated local laws. “This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which conducts research on online hate and disinformation.“There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok. ”X and Musk’s AI start-up, xAI, which owns X and makes Grok, did not respond to requests for comment. The interest in Grok’s image-editing abilities exploded on Dec 31, when Musk shared a photo generated by the chatbot of himself in a bikini, as well as a SpaceX rocket with a woman’s undressed body superimposed on top. The chatbot has a public account on X, where users can ask it questions or request alterations to images. Users flocked to the social media site, in many cases asking Grok to remove clothing in images of women and kids, after which the bot publicly posted the AI-generated images.On Jan 8, X limited Grok’s AI image creation to users who pay for some premium features, significantly reducing the number of images.Last week, X expanded those guardrails, saying it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” Since then, Grok has largely ignored requests to dress women in bikinis, but has created images of them in leotards. The curbs did not extend to Grok’s app or website, which continue to allow users to generate sexual content in private.","Elon musk’s ai chatbot, grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women, according to separate estimates of x data.

A Kansas City man is facing major legal trouble after prosecutors accused him of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day. Authorities say Mamadou Diallo used forged paperwork to make the deals look legitimate, convincing victims to hand over thousands of dollars before the cars disappeared from their driveways. The case has gone viral online, with many reacting in disbelief at how the same pattern reportedly played out again and again across at least eight separate sales.Police reports say the seller listed cars for sale on Facebook Marketplace and met buyers in person to complete the transactions. Buyers believed they were purchasing legally owned vehicles after being given documents that appeared to include valid titles and bills of sale.Within hours, and often within 24 hours, the vehicles were reported stolen, leaving the new owners with no car and no money back.Investigators say the cases followed a repeated pattern across multiple transactions. Buyers purchased either a 2013 grey Honda Civic or a 2013 brown Buick Verano, only for the same vehicle to show up again in another sale soon after.In one reported case, a car was taken back in as little as seven hours, with a theft captured on home CCTV during the early morning.Diallo now faces 14 felony counts, including:If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 98 years in prison, showing how seriously prosecutors are treating the repeated fraud and vehicle theft accusations.Police records link the incidents to May and June 2025, when Kansas City Police received multiple stolen vehicle reports connected to Facebook Marketplace purchases. Investigators later matched the cases based on similarities in listings, vehicles, and paperwork.The charges were announced in January 2026.The story exploded online after being shared widely on X, drawing millions of views. Many users joked that the scheme sounded like an “infinite money glitch” and compared it to Wall Street-style tactics, while others questioned whether the possible sentence is too harsh for a non-violent crime.The case has renewed concerns about the risks of peer-to-peer online sales, especially when large amounts of money exchange hands quickly. Unlike dealership purchases, private sales rely heavily on trust and paperwork, and forged documents can be difficult to detect on the spot.Experts often recommend buyers take extra precautions before paying for a vehicle, including:The case is now being viewed as a cautionary example of how quickly an online deal can turn into an expensive mistake.","Mamadou diallo is accused of running a facebook marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day.
