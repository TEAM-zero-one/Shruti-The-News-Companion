ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire richard branson ignored on nyc streets while promoting ‘doorbell of dreams’ the video shows branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “can i ask you a question?” but instead of engaging, people brushed him off.

Big change for H-1Bs: Donald Trump signs proclamation imposing $100k annual fee on visa application; aim to protect US tech jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/big-change-for-h-1bs-donald-trump-signs-order-to-increase-visa-application-fee-to-100000-aim-to-protect-us-tech-jobs/articleshow/124006406.cms,"Trump sings order to increase H1-B visa application fees

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy Slams Donald Trump's Tariff Gambit, Backs Stronger India-US Ties

Significance of the new rule





US President Donald Trump has signed a new proclamation on Friday (US time) introducing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications, along with other changes to the skilled foreign worker programme, which has been under scrutiny for years.Originally designed to attract exceptional foreign talent for specialised technical roles, the H-1B programme has evolved into a channel for workers accepting salaries around $60,000 annually—well below the $100,000-plus compensation typical for American technology professionals, according to AP reports.""I think they're going to be very happy,"" Trump said, anticipating the tech industry’s response to the changes.Additionally, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said, ""One of the most abused visa systems is the H1-B non-immigrant visa programme. This is supposed to allow highly skilled labourers who work in fields that Americans don't work in to come into the United States of America. What this proclamation will do is raise the fee that companies pay to sponsor H-1B applicants to $100,000. This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers.It is noteworthy that First Lady Melania Trump, formerly Melania Knauss, received an H-1B visa in October 1996 for modelling work; she hails from Slovenia.Established in 1990, the H-1B programme targets individuals with bachelor's degrees or higher in difficult-to-fill positions, particularly in STEM fields. Critics argue the system enables lower wages and limited worker protections. The annual quota of 85,000 visas has traditionally been distributed through a lottery.Lottery applications fell nearly 40 per cent in 2024, following measures to prevent multiple entries that skewed selection odds. Major tech companies had requested reforms after surging applications reduced individual chances, prompting USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to limit candidates to a single lottery entry, regardless of multiple job offers.Amazon currently leads in approvals with over 10,000, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple, and Google, with California hosting the largest H-1B workforce.Detractors note that many H-1B positions are junior-level roles rather than senior specialist jobs. Companies can reportedly reduce costs by classifying roles at lower skill levels while employing experienced workers. This has led to outsourcing of basic technical operations to consultancies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Tata, IBM, and Cognizant, which employ foreign workers—mostly from India—contracted to American firms seeking cost savings.While critics welcome these changes, they are calling for further reforms. The AFL-CIO said the measures are ""some steps in the right direction"" but advocated for visas to be allocated based on highest wage offers rather than random selection—a proposal previously floated during Trump’s first term.The increased fees could affect hiring foreign workers as it'll cost more for companies. Currently, companies pay $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for a Form I-129, the employer-sponsored petition for a non-immigrant worker.The move is expected to discourage mass applications for H-1B visas, particularly affecting startups and small businesses that may struggle to absorb the higher upfront cost. Companies hiring foreign workers will now face significantly higher expenses, potentially shifting focus back to American tech workers.Also read: $100,000 fee for companies hiring H-1Bs- What does this mean? What is the present cost? The change also aims to curb abuse of the H-1B system, where companies hire foreigners at lower wages for entry-level roles, while paying Americans significantly more for the same jobs. With the $100,000 fee, hiring foreign talent becomes equally costly, likely reducing opportunities for H-1B-dependent workers.The overhaul comes amid discussions to reform or end the lottery system and raise wage requirements, prioritizing high-wage, high-skill foreign workers and opening more entry-level jobs for US graduates. The administration’s broader goal is to protect American employment in the technology sector.","Trump sings order to increase h1-b visa application fees to $100,000.

0% returns: Why Sensex has been flat for over a year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-the-sensex-is-flat-over-a-year/articleshow/124004747.cms,"Representative image

Earnings-valuation mismatch

Foreign investor flight

What next?





MUMBAI: The sensex has delivered 0% returns over the past 12 months, underperforming most global markets, despite several positive factors like I-T and GST relief, interest rate cuts and steady domestic fund flows.What explains this weak performance? According to analysts, weak fundamentals are a major drag on Dalal Street’s gains.“The weak performance of the Indian market over the past year may seem surprising, given the euphoria among retail investors, several narratives that drove certain sectors and themes periodically, large fiscal and monetary support, and weak rupee (positive for earnings). However, it is less surprising when viewed against earnings and valuations,” a report by Kotak Institutional Equities said.The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year. BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices are both down more than 4% over the past 12 months.According to the report, valuations have remained elevated despite several stocks being flat or down over this period due to constant earnings downgrades.“Corporate earnings have been lacklustre with Nifty 50 companies delivering 8% growth, below market expectations, as delayed urban demand recovery and persistent input cost inflation weighed on performance,” Devarsh Vakil, head of Prime Research at HDFC Securities, said.How did valuations surge in the first place? The post-Covid pent-up consumption demand is partly to blame. “The growth rate in earnings shot up between 2022-24. This led to markets commanding higher valuation premiums,” said Siddarth Bhamre, institutional research head at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates.The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year. BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices are both down more than 4% over the past 12 months.Trade tensions with the US have created policy uncertainty — this, in turn, has heightened foreign investor caution and accelerated portfolio shifts toward cheaper emerging markets, Vakil said.While foreign funds (FPIs) have pulled out around $20 billion in 2025, domestic institutional investors have pumped in around $62 billion in the same period. However, this hasn’t led to sizable year-to-date gains — the sensex is up 5.5% year-to-date. The underperformance “disproves the market’s belief in ‘flows’ as a driver” of Dalal Street, the Kotak report said.To be sure, the steady mutual fund flows have cushioned the impact from FPI selling. “Without mutual fund flows, FPI selling would have had a large negative impact on the markets,” Bhamre said.According to market players, such flat growth periods are opportunities for long-term mutual fund investors to accumulate units in their portfolios. While mutual fund industry body data showed that equity MF flows saw a sharp decline, the drop in SIP flows was modest. “Healthy SIP inflows reflect the confidence that retail investors have in the markets,” Ankur Punj, MD & business head at Equirus Wealth, said.According to Vakil, the return of foreign investors and a recovery in earnings will lift Dalal Street sentiment. “A mutually acceptable resolution to US trade negotiations would eliminate policy uncertainty and restore FPI confidence. Stronger Q2 earnings would signal economic recovery and drive stock-specific rallies. Global interest rate easing will also make India more attractive to yield-seeking investors, potentially triggering renewed capital inflows,” he said.Capital expenditure announcements by govt and the private sector will be a bigger trigger for the revival of the consumption cycle, which will eventually lead to earnings recovery, Bhamre said. “Reduction of interest rates and taxes are supportive factors but not a deciding variable in decision making to spend,” he said.Analysts at Kotak expect a gradual earnings improvement over the next few quarters and strong earnings growth in FY27. “However, valuations are rich, despite our strong expected earnings recovery,” the report cautioned.",The broader market has performed worse than the 30-share sensex over a year.

Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry



iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Series Mega Unboxing





Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese ai developer deepseek has revealed the cost of training its r1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its us rivals.

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration. Intel acknowledges it needs the company it once could have owned to remain relevant in computing's AI-driven future.""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, diplomatic language for Intel's dependence on its former potential acquisition target.The investment follows recent lifelines, including government backing and SoftBank's $2 billion injection as Intel struggles to fund its manufacturing ambitions.Intel shares jumped 22% after Nvidia announced $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.",Intel rejected buying nvidia for $20 billion in 2005.

Meta aims to grow AR market by empowering developers with Celeste

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Meta platforms, the parent company of facebook and instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual connect event.

"Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison have one thing in common: All were adopted – the unknown lives of billionaires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-jeff-bezos-and-larry-ellison-have-one-thing-in-common-all-were-adopted-the-unknown-lives-of-billionaires/articleshow/123967862.cms,"Steve Jobs: Parents who adopted him nurtured his creativity



Jeff Bezos: From Jeffrey Jorgensen to Amazon founder

Larry Ellison: Adopted by his aunt and uncle, shaping a self-reliant tech titan



Dave Thomas: Overcoming early hardships to create Wendy’s





The world’s most successful entrepreneurs often captivate us with their business acumen, vision, and relentless drive, but there’s one factor in the early lives of Steve Jobs Jeff Bezos , and Larry Ellison that many people overlook: they were all adopted. Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon , and Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, each grew up in adoptive families that provided stability, guidance, and emotional support. While adoption is not the sole reason for their extraordinary achievements, it may have shaped their resilience, ambition, creativity, and determination to succeed against the odds. These inspiring stories offer a glimpse into the unknown early lives of billionaires and highlight how early life experiences can influence lifelong success.Steve Jobs was born to Abdulfattah Jandali, a Syrian student pursuing a PhD, and Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent. Because Joanne’s parents opposed the relationship and pregnancy, she opted for a closed adoption. The couple originally selected to adopt Jobs backed out after learning the baby was a boy. He was eventually adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple who promised to save for his college education. Jobs was fiercely loyal to his adoptive parents, viewing them as his true family. Throughout his life, he often referred to his biological parents as “my sperm and egg bank.”The nurturing environment provided by Paul and Clara helped cultivate his creativity, curiosity, and relentless pursuit of innovation, which later defined his career at Apple and Pixar.Born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen, Jeff Bezos experienced early family instability. His teenage mother, Jacklyn, divorced his biological father when Jeff was just 17 months old, leaving her to raise him alone under difficult circumstances. At age four, Jacklyn married Miguel “Mike” Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who adopted Jeff and gave him the surname Bezos. Mike Bezos became a guiding force in Jeff’s life, instilling discipline, a strong work ethic, and a love for learning. Jeff has often credited Mike for providing the stability and support that allowed him to explore his interests in science, technology, and entrepreneurship. The adoption offered him a second chance at a stable family environment, which may have contributed to the resilience and strategic thinking that later fueled the creation of Amazon.Larry Ellison’s early life was marked by health and family challenges. Born in New York City to a 19-year-old single mother, he contracted pneumonia as an infant. His mother made the difficult decision to give him up for adoption, and he was taken in by his mother’s aunt and uncle, Lillian and Louis Ellison, in Chicago. Larry was aware of being adopted but fully grasped the reality at age 12. Lillian provided warmth and nurturing, while Louis was often stern and distant, creating a complex family dynamic. Growing up in modest circumstances on Chicago’s South Side, Ellison developed a sense of independence, ambition, and self-reliance that would later drive his success at Oracle. He only met his biological mother at age 48, which reinforced the sense of self-made achievement that characterizes his public persona.Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy’s, also had an adoption story that shaped his values and vision. Born Rex David Thomas, he was adopted as an infant by Rex and Auleva Thomas in New Jersey. Despite losing his adoptive mother at age five and facing further family losses, he developed resilience and empathy. His early experiences inspired him to advocate for adoption later in life, leading to the creation of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, which helps children in foster care find permanent homes. Dave’s story demonstrates how adoption, combined with love and support, can nurture determination, compassion, and a lifelong commitment to giving back.","Steve jobs, the apple co-founder, jeff bezos, the founder of amazon, and larry ellison all grew up in adoptive families that provided stability, guidance, and emotional support.
