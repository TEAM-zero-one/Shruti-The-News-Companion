Jensen Huang’s AI warning

Your iPhone's NEW Home is India: Apple's new Manufacturing HUB!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that programming artificial intelligence (AI) is similar to how one “programs a person”. Speaking at London Tech Week recently, Huang said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” Huang added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”Jensen Huang continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Jensen Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet. You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.”“And when it answers, you could say, 'I feel like you could do even better.' And it will go off and think about it and it will come back and say, 'In fact, I can do better.' And it does do a better job.”Jensen Huang’s comments after he warned of changing workplace due to AI. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in May this year, he said “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.”Huang’s message underlines a critical paradigm shift — the disruption caused by AI won’t simply be about outright job loss through automation but about a growing divide between those who harness AI as a tool and those who do not.","Jensen huang said that ai is a ‘great equalizer’ as it enables anyone to program using everyday language.

HP EliteBook Ultra G1i Review: Thin, light, power in a premium package

Deloitte is letting its US employees spend part of their annual wellness subsidy on Lego sets, puzzles, and other stress-relieving items. According to a Business Insider, the action is part of a revamped effort by the company to support worker well-being. According to internal policy documents seen by the publication, the Big Four consulting firm updated its long-running benefits program at the start of its financial year on June 1. The program gives most salaried employees up to $1,000 annually to spend on approved items that promote mental, physical, or financial wellness, the report says. Legos, along with puzzles, kitchen appliances, spa services, gaming consoles, and ergonomic pillows, are among the new additions.Deloitte US had 172,800 employees in 2024. As per the report, employees have welcomed the change. A Deloitte employee said that the update sparked jokes and excitement on internal chats. “Most of the responses are things like ‘Lego?!?!? Finally!’ or jokes about how they can now rationalise buying the coveted Millennium Falcon Star Wars Lego set,” they said. The $850 set leaves a small remainder of the subsidy for other qualifying purchases.Another Deloitte employee said that the benefit helps manage the intense pace of work: “Knocking out a four-hour Lego build in under two hours is a great stress reliever.”However, not all employees are happy with it. Some Deloitte employees remain skeptical. One staffer told BI the perk exists “because of how much this job sucks.”The updated program comes as Deloitte’s US division faces challenges, particularly in its government consulting arm. By April 2025, at least 127 federal contracts had been modified or canceled following the White House’s push to cut spending. Deloitte Consulting CEO Jason Salzetti later confirmed that a “small percentage” of employees in the government division would be laid off.","Deloitte us had 172,800 employees in 2024.

This marks Paytm's steepest single-day drop since February 2024, as investor sentiment took a hit following the official denial.The sharp fall in the stock price of One 97 Communications, Paytm’s parent company, came after the finance ministry on Wednesday clarified that reports suggesting MDR charges on UPI payments were ""false, baseless, and misleading.""""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading. Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens.

If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy.

MUMBAI: RBI has eased KYC norms to simplify compliance and to make it easier for individuals to access long-dormant bank accounts and unclaimed deposits, many of which have remained untouched for over 10 years.The move, announced through a circular on June 12, aims to ensure that anti-money laundering rules do not hinder rightful account holders from accessing their savings particularly in accounts opened to receive government benefits.RBI has asked banks to give three advance intimations prior to the due date of periodic updation of KYC and at least one intimation must be by letter. In the past customers have complained that digital alerts have been missed and they only come to know when they are not able to transact on their account.The central bank has also asked banks to allow KYC updates at any branch, irrespective of where the account was opened. It has also permitted the use of Aadhaar OTP and video-based customer identification for periodic KYC updates. Business correspondents, especially in rural areas, can now assist customers with reactivating inoperative accounts and completing KYC requirements.According to RBI, banks must take an 'empathetic view' when dealing with low-risk customers seeking to update their KYC or reactivate dormant accounts.Customers with no changes in personal information, or only a change of address, can now submit self-declarations through digital or offline channels, without the need for additional documents.Banks have been directed to organise KYC update camps, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, and to launch focused campaigns in branches with a high number of pending updates. These efforts are particularly targeted at accounts linked to direct benefit transfers and Jan Dhan accounts, where KYC compliance has lagged.According to Anand Bajaj, founder MD & CEO of PayNeary, allowing business correspondents to collect self-declarations and assist with biometric-based e-KYC, will allow banks to efficiently reach customers in areas with limited branches.","The move aims to ensure that anti-money laundering rules do not hinder rightful account holders from accessing their savings.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol.
