"No nationwide rollout of satellite tolling from May 1, FASTag-based toll collection to continue: Government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-nationwide-rollout-of-satellite-tolling-from-may-1-fastag-based-toll-collection-to-continue-government/articleshow/120404718.cms,"The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) on Friday dismissed reports suggesting that a satellite-based tolling system would be rolled out nationwide from 1 May 2025, replacing the current FASTag system .Clarifying the speculation, the ministry said no such decision has been taken and that the public should not be misled by unverified claims in the media.The MoRTH said that an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)-FASTag-based barrier-less tolling system will be introduced at select locations in order to enhance seamless movement of vehicles and reduce congestion at toll plazas.The upcoming system will use a hybrid approach, combining ANPR technology , which identifies vehicles by reading their number plates, with the existing FASTag system that relies on Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to deduct tolls.With the new system, vehicles will be automatically charged based on identification through high-performance ANPR cameras and FASTag readers, eliminating the need to stop at toll plazas.The ministry added that violators could face penalties. E-notices will be issued for non-compliance and continued failure to pay may lead to FASTag suspension along with other VAHAN-related penalties, the statement warned.The ministry reiterated that this tech-driven upgrade is being piloted only at select toll plazas for now and is not a blanket nationwide rollout.","The ministry of road transport and highways dismissed reports suggesting a satellite-based tolling system would be rolled out nationwide from 1 may 2025.

India 1st nation to achieve artificial breeding of Great Indian Bustard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-1st-nation-to-achieve-artificial-breeding-of-great-indian-bustard/articleshow/120445296.cms,"JAISALMER : India became the world’s first country to achieve success in the artificial breeding of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) with the birth of the third GIB chick through artificial insemination at Jaisalmer’s Desert National Park Thursday.The technology and training for artificial insemination, obtained from Abu Dhabi-based organisation “International Fund for Houbara Conservation”, contributed to saving this rapidly vanishing Schedule I wildlife species. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) scientists had received specialised training from the organisation.Suthirto Dutta, WII senior scientist and coordinator of the GIB project at the Jaisalmer Bustard Breeding Centre, said this was the third chick born entirely through artificial methods under this project, marking a historic achievement for India. This groundbreaking development was not just a success of a biological experiment but a milestone in giving new life to this rare bird on the brink of extinction. Dutta said the Bustard Recovery Programme achieved this remarkable feat through artificial insemination. The scientific team procured semen from a male at the Sam Conservation Breeding Centre and artificially inseminated a four-year-old female at the facility.“Project Great Indian Bustard reached a new milestone as the 11th chick of 2025 hatched on April 17 from an egg laid by the female ‘Sharky’ on March 26 in Sam Centre, after being artificially inseminated on March 20 with semen from the male ‘Suda’ housed in Ramdevra Centre, taking the GIB tally in the national conservation breeding programme to 55. This also marked the third success in artificial insemination for the species,” said Dutta.Suthirto Dutta said the procedure involved collecting male bustard sperm for artificial insemination, culminating in the birth of a vigorous chick. WII’s endeavours proved fruitful, with the artificial breeding centre demonstrating its efficacy. Specialists verified the chick’s robust health condition.","India becomes the world’s first country to achieve success in the artificial breeding of the great indian bustard.

NEW DELHI: With Tesla set to launch cars in India soon, and satcom venture Starlink in the final phase of goverment approval process, American tech billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday said he will be visiting the country later this year, the comments coming a day after he spoke to PM Narendra Modi over telephone.""It was an honour to speak with PM Modi. I am looking forward to visiting India later this year!"" Musk said on X, as he responded to Modi's post on their conversation.On Friday, Modi had posted on X, ""Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains.""Modi and Musk had met during the PM's visit to the US in February. They had discussed opportunities and cooperation between businesses of the two countries in areas such as electric vehicles, space, and renewable energy.Musk's plans appeared to have gone on hold when in 2024 he had abruptly cancelled his planned visit to India, though travelling to China just a few days later. However, things warmed up again later, especially the bonhomie between the PM and Musk.Tesla has been working on its India entry plan for years now, and is likely to launch cars soon through the import route initially. While the company works out local manufacturing plans, possibly with an all-new budget car, it will test the waters for its imported EVs that will be retailed out of outlets coming up in New Delhi and Mumbai.On Starlink, the company's application for a satcom licence has been pending for years as the government and company executives work out various mandated compliances, including those around security aspects.Elon Musk said Saturday he would visit India later this year, as Tesla prepares to launch cars in the country and satcom venture Starlink is in the final phase of the govt approval process.

What Barack-Michelle said about rumors of their divorce



Barack Obama-Michelle marriage crisis is far from finishing its shelf life as people can't stop talking about it. And the main reason for it is that Barack and Michelle can't stop talking about their marriage either. Michelle has addressed her marriage in her new podcast IMO, with her co-host and older brother Craig Robinson.Megyn Kelly , in the latest episode of her podcast, spoke about what Michelle and Barack have been saying about each other and concluded that they married the wrong people. ""I’ve been married for 17-and-a-half years and not one was bad. I think she and he married the wrong people. Every word she says about Barack Obama is negative… Every time she opines, it’s something that reflects poorly on him – how he’s insensitive, how he’s not a talker, how he doesn’t know how to relate to people, he doesn’t keep the same schedule as she does. And now we’re talking about how you can have a bad decade in a marriage,"" Megyn said.Megyn Kelly fails to mention she's been married twice, Mike Sington wrote on X taking a swipe at Megyn.The rumors of an impending divorce of Barack Obama and Michelle were so intense that Barack Obama was even linked with actor Jennifer Aniston, when Michelle Obama missed several public events where a former first lady is expected to accompany her husband.Barack Obama opened up about his relationship with Michelle and recently revealed that he was in a ""deep deficit"" with Michelle after leaving office and he's still trying to make up to her. “I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things,” he said.Michelle Obama commented on Barack's solo appearances and said she now has the opportunity to control her own calendar and can now make “a choice for myself.”“I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom,” she said. “And now that’s gone. And so now I have to look at my — I get to look at my calendar, which I did this year, was a real big example of me, myself looking at something that I was supposed to do — you know, without naming names — and I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”“That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,” Michelle continued. “I mean so much so that this year people were, you know — they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”","Megyn kelly said she thinks barack and michelle obama married the wrong persons.

Google, Meta, Microsoft among top tech firms slashing jobs in 2025

Google: Streamlining amid structural shifts

Microsoft: Organizational restructuring expected in May

Meta: Performance-based layoffs and executive bonus backlash

TikTok: Job reductions in Dublin office

The technology sector is undergoing yet another wave of workforce reductions in 2025, following an already turbulent 2024 marked by widespread layoffs. As companies shift their focus to automation, artificial intelligence, and cost-efficiency, job cuts are becoming a recurring theme across some of the industry's biggest players. According to data from layoff tracking platform Trueup, 234 layoffs have already been recorded in the tech industry this year, affecting 45,656 employees—an average of 439 job losses per day.For comparison, 2024 saw a total of 1,115 layoff incidents with a staggering 238,461 workers affected, translating to an average of 653 daily dismissals. The job cuts reflect a strategic realignment aimed at optimizing resource allocation and enhancing profitability, particularly in high-growth segments such as AI and cloud computing.Google has been among the most active in workforce restructuring, entering its third round of layoffs in 2025. This latest reduction targets several hundred employees within its Platforms & Devices unit, which encompasses key products including Android, Pixel smartphones, and the Chrome web browser.Earlier in the year, Google initiated a “voluntary exit” program specifically for U.S.-based employees in the same division. This followed a 2024 internal reorganization that merged Android and Pixel teams to consolidate operations. The company also reduced headcount in its cloud division in February 2025. A Google spokesperson stated that the actions were necessary “to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”Microsoft is reportedly preparing for another round of layoffs expected to take place as early as May 2025. While official numbers have not been disclosed, internal restructuring is likely to target middle management layers. The company's ongoing objective is to increase the ratio of technical personnel, especially engineers, across all business units.Within Microsoft’s security division, for instance, leadership aims to shift the engineer-to-project manager ratio from 5.5:1 to a leaner 10:1. Performance evaluations are playing a significant role in the decision-making process, and employees with consistently low performance ratings may face termination as part of the streamlining efforts.In February 2025, Meta laid off approximately 3,600 employees, representing nearly 5% of its global workforce. The layoffs were primarily attributed to internal performance evaluations and are consistent with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated vision of transforming Meta into a more efficient and agile organization.However, the timing of the layoffs attracted criticism after the company announced sizable bonus allocations for senior executives shortly afterward. This has sparked debate about compensation disparities and employee morale, especially as many mid- and entry-level workers were affected by the cuts.TikTok has joined the list of tech companies implementing layoffs this year, with around 300 jobs expected to be eliminated at its Dublin office. While the final number is yet to be confirmed, the redundancies are anticipated to take place in April 2025.This move follows a broader trend of workforce optimization across the technology sector, raising concerns among employees in Europe and beyond about job security. The reduction also underscores the challenges facing social media companies amid shifting regulatory environments and growing operational costs.","Google, microsoft, meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that CEO Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his Bloomberg interview, Gerber defended his Tesla comments, responding to the criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war.

Aman Gupta’s take on the BluSmart crisis

Read Aman Gupta’s complete post here

The BluSmart situation is tough. Sad for everyone involved. But also a much-needed reality check for all of us in the ecosystem.

I know what it feels like:

- Investors lost money

- Founders lost years of hard work

- Employees lost stability

- And customers lost a service they genuinely loved (Hope they get the money in Bluesmart wallet)

But more than that, this has also dented trust in the ecosystem. You’ll now hear: “Yaad hai Blusmart ke saath kya hua tha?!”

And, one might say that that’s the damage we can’t afford. But, let’s zoom out. Even global MNCs have had their meltdowns. What matters is how we as a country and ecosystem bounce back.

The Indian startup ecosystem is resilient. We always rise stronger. And we will this time too.

For all founders, here’s the biggest takeaway: Compliance and ethics aren’t boxes to tick. They’re the foundation.

Being a CA, I’ve seen this up close: Clean books, Timely audits, Transparent reporting. All so called “not so cool tasks” make businesses sustainable.

Aur bachpan mein parents ne sikhaya tha - Jo bhi karo, dil se karo. Par Galat na karo. Same rule applies in business too :)

EQ, IQ & GQ (Governance Quotient) sab important hote hai. I hope more founders push for real due diligence, not just in finance, but in culture, operations, and responsibility.

Because at the end of the day your vision matters. Your growth matters. But how you build matters just as much.

Let’s use this as a reminder: To build not just fast, but right

Tom Brady opens up about the true meaning of love



Tom Brady , the NFL legend and seven-time Super Bowl champion, took a heartfelt pause from his post-football ventures to honor the foundation that shaped him—his parents. In a touching tribute posted on social media, Tom celebrated his parents' 56th wedding anniversary with a message that not only showcased his gratitude but also offered fans a rare glimpse into the values that molded him into who he is today.“56 years ago in Browerville, MN… Happy Anniversary to the most incredible parents anyone could ask for,” Tom Brady wrote, sharing a series of family photos that radiated warmth and love . “Over the years, you’ve shown our whole family what it truly means to build a life of love, laughter and faith. You’ve taught us how to support one another, how to grow together, and how to face life’s challenges. We’re endlessly grateful for everything you’ve done and continue to do for us. Thank you for being the heart of our family. Here’s to 56 amazing years—and many more to come!”Brady, now 47, is the youngest of four children born to Galynn and Tom Brady Sr., who wed on April 19, 1969, in Browerville, Minnesota. His upbringing in a close-knit family with strong moral grounding continues to influence the choices he makes—even as he navigates the complexities of life after football.While his parents’ enduring bond remains rock-solid, Brady’s own romantic journey has taken a different path. His high-profile marriage to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen ended in 2022 after 13 years. The separation, finalized with mutual respect, marked the end of a significant chapter for both.In recent developments, Bündchen, 44, has embraced a new beginning herself. Two months ago, she welcomed a baby boy with her partner, Joaquim Valente, a jiu-jitsu instructor who is described by sources as “so different… much more chill and laid-back” compared to Brady. Meanwhile, Brady has reportedly reentered the dating world, albeit more cautiously. He’s been linked in the past to model Irina Shayk and is said to be “casually dating” since the conclusion of the last NFL season.Despite the personal shifts, Tom Brady remains focused on building a legacy beyond the field. Since retiring in 2023, he has stepped into sports ownership with stakes in the Las Vegas Raiders and Birmingham City FC, while also kicking off his broadcasting career with Fox Sports under a decade-long contract.In a subtle yet powerful message shared on social media following news of his ex-wife’s new baby, Brady reposted a quote that read: “I really think the secret to being loved is to love… And the secret to having a friend is being a friend.” With three heart emojis and the caption “Love this,” Brady offered a glimpse into his evolving perspective—rooted, perhaps, in the values passed down from the very couple he so lovingly honored.Also Read: Fashion's biggest night or PR minefield?

"Viral London ad slams Bezos over Katy Perry’s space trip, netizens react",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/viral-london-ad-slams-bezos-over-katy-perrys-space-trip-netizens-react/articleshow/120426852.cms,"An image mocking Amazon founder Jeff Bezos over tax payments went viral this week after appearing near a London bus stand. The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos. One user commented, “Jeff Bezos is an American and as such pays income taxes to the US, thank you for coming to my TED talk.” Another wrote, “Sending more money to the government is more wasteful than sending money to space.”","Billboard features amazon founder jeff bezos alongside pop star katy perry.

Fair pricing for small forex buyers RBI’s priority: Governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fair-pricing-for-small-forex-buyers-rbis-priority-governor/articleshow/120445931.cms,"MUMBAI: Ensuring fair treatment of smaller and less-sophisticated customers in forex market and increasing retail participation in government securities (G-Sec/gilt) market were among the central bank’s continuing priorities, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra has said.Malhotra was speaking at FIMMDA-PDAI’s annual conference in Bali Friday. He said dwindling liquidity in the call money market, and occasional asymmetries observed between different money market rates require attention of the central bank. He asked banks to ensure that RBI’s liquidity measures are promptly and seamlessly transmitted to the broader market.The RBI chief said over the past few decades, India has made significant strides in development of financial markets in the country in terms of market infrastructure, liquidity in available products as well as product diversity. “These advancements are a testament to your dedication, innovation, and collaborative efforts,” he said. “Today, we have vibrant financial markets that not only continue to support India’s economic growth but also inspire global confidence. ”Malhotra also said that as global financial markets are evolving rapidly, RBI was continuously monitoring and assessing economic outlook.Speaking about the country’s G-Sec market , Malhotra said that increasing retail participation in this market had been one of RBI’s continuing endeavour. It has taken several steps in recent years to ensure that sufficient secondary market liquidity is available to retail investors so that they can participate in this market at reasonable prices, he said.“Liquidity and pricing also need to improve for participants like cooperative banks, pension, and provident funds with smaller deal sizes. Banks and primary dealers may need to play a much more active role to this end,” Malhotra said.The RBI chief also pointed out that in forex market, the divergence in pricing for small and large customers are far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations. One of the reasons is the reluctance of banks to offer the platform to their customers, he said.The RBI chief said the central bank has launched its FX Retail, a transparent platform for undertaking forex transactions, through Bharat Connect platform where individuals can purchase US dollars.Malhotra also warned about the practice of banks associating with unauthorised forex trading platforms.","Malhotra was speaking at fimmda-pdai’s annual conference in bali friday.

Eternal secures board nod to cap foreign ownership at 49.5%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/eternal-secures-board-nod-to-cap-foreign-ownership-at-49-5/articleshow/120438648.cms,"MUMBAI: Eternal (formerly Zomato ) has secured board approval to cap foreign ownership in the firm at 49.5%. The move, the company said, will allow it to retain its status as an Indian-owned-and-controlled company (IOCC), enabling greater operational flexibility particularly for the firm’s quick commerce business Blinkit With board nod in place, Eternal has approached its shareholders to seek approval for the same. As of March 31, domestic shareholding in the company stood at about 55%. “To ensure we retain our IOCC status, we are seeking an enabling approval from shareholders for a cap of up to 49.5% on foreign ownership, subject to applicable laws….being an IOCC will help unlock new opportunities in quick commerce,” Eternal said in a filing to the exchanges.Eternal said that Blinkit currently operates as a third-party marketplace relying entirely on third-party sellers that own the inventory of goods sold on the platform. As an IOCC, it can transition towards an inventory-led model which will allow Blinkit to drive growth by introducing new, underserved categories which third-party sellers may not be currently investing in. Direct inventory ownership also allows better margins in categories like FMCG “This change aligns with our strategy to optimise the assortment, quality and value mix for our customers in the quick commerce business,” Eternal said.Eternal competes with Swiggy Instamart Zepto and Tata’s BigBasket in the quick commerce space which is rapidly growing and expanding its coverage of categories on the back of rising consumer adoption, especially in the major metro cities. “Maintaining our IOCC status represents an important strategic lever that aligns with our long-term vision: to innovate faster, serve customers better, support local entrepreneurs and deliver stringer returns to shareholders,” the company said.","Eternal (formerly zomato) has secured board approval to cap foreign ownership in the firm at 49.5%.

NEW DELHI: With Tesla set to launch cars in India soon, and satcom venture Starlink in the final phase of govt approval process, American tech billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday said he will be visiting the country later this year, the comments coming a day after he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over telephone.“It was an honour to speak with PM Modi. I am looking forward to visiting India later this year!” Musk said on his micro-blogging platform X, as he responded to Modi’s post on their conversation.On Friday, Modi had sent out a post from his official X handle where he spoke about their discussions, “Spoke to Elon Musk and talked about various issues, including the topics we covered during our meeting in Washington DC earlier this year. We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains. ”Modi and Musk had met during PM’s visit to the US in February this year, and this had seen the two discuss opportunities and cooperation between businesses of the two countries in areas such as electric vehicles, space, and renewable energy.Tesla has been working on its India entry plan for years now, and is likely to launch cars soon through the import route in the beginning. While the company works out local manufacturing plans in the country, possibly with an all-new budget car, it will test the waters for its imported EVs that will be retailed out of outlets coming up in New Delhi and Mumbai.On the front of Starlink, the company’s application for a satcom license has been pending for years as the govt and company executives work out various mandated compliances, including those around security aspects.Govt has asked Starlink to set up a ‘control centre’ in India in order to enable suspension or shutdown of communications services in sensitive and troubled areas, whenever required to maintain law and order. Also, the security establishment has specified mandates to allow call interceptions by law-enforcement agencies through official channels when the need arises.Sources say the company is in the process of working out solutions in this regard. Last week, a delegation from Starlink’s headquarters had met Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal regarding the regulatory processes as well as their business plans. Starlink’s delegation had included VP Chad Gibbs and Senior Director, Ryan Goodnight.Govt believes that Tesla’s local factory has the potential to boost exports from the country, on the lines of the success seen with Apple’s iPhones.","Us tech billionaire elon musk said he will be visiting the country later this year.
