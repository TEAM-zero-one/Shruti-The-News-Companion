The company will provide affected staff with severance benefits, outplacement services, and extended insurance coverage.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits. Additionally, TCS plans to provide insurance coverage extension and career transition assistance to those affected by this decision, the report said.TCS also said, “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""This workforce reduction comes within days of many TCS staff employees initiating legal proceedings challenging the company's modified bench policy. The revised policy stipulates that employees can only remain unbilled for 35 days annually and must achieve a minimum of 225 billable days per year.Recently it was reported that TCS has delayed the onboarding of 600 lateral hires. TCS issued a notice regarding 'indefinite delay', without providing any new joining dates for the selected technology professionals.NITES (Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate) has escalated this matter to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya through a written communication, highlighting concerns about the financial difficulties and psychological stress faced by these professionals due to the uncertain situation.TCS announced its comprehensive strategic approach, which includes investments in emerging technologies, market expansion, large-scale AI implementation for clients and internal operations, strengthening partnerships, developing advanced infrastructure and restructuring their employment framework.To achieve these objectives, various programmes focused on skill enhancement and staff reallocation have been initiated and are currently in progress.","Tata consultancy services plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 2%, impacting over 12,000 employees.

Delhi govt requests SC to review 2018 blanket ban affecting middle class the most,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-requests-sc-to-review-2018-blanket-ban-affecting-middle-class-the-most/articleshow/122918617.cms,"ANI file photo

NEW DELHI: In a bold step, the Delhi Govt on Friday requested the Supreme Court to reconsider its 2018 blanket ban on plying of over 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles on the roads of entire National Capital Region saying stricter BS-VI norm compliant vehicles emit far less pollutants compared to BS-IV vehicles.It requested the SC to direct the Union govt or Air Quality Management to “carry out a suitable broad-based, scientific study on the need for continuance of a complete ban on playing of 15 or more years old petrol and 10 or more years old diesel vehicles of all categories in NCR, imposed by the SC through its order on Oct 10, 2018”.The Delhi govt said the blanket ban, not backed by any scientific study, does not differentiate between poorly maintained,The directive to off-road vehicles purely on the basis of age disproportionately affects the middle-class population whose vehicles are less used, well-maintained, and pollution norm compliant, the govt said. “Studies indicate that these vehicles often have significantly lower annual mileage and contribute negligibly to overall emissions,” it said.It said the significant improvement in Pollution Under Control Technology, increased coverage of PUC testing, stricter monitoring of emission standards, transition to BS-VS engines and other measures have suitably addressed the concerns that had impelled the SC to pass the order seven years ago.Road-worthiness is a technical and scientific issue that must be linked to actual emissions of a vehicle, which is required to be banned, and not a blanket ban based on the age of the vehicles, it said, echoing the popular sentiments of people living in the national capital region and Delhi.Delhi govt, through an application settled by additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, said, “There is a need for a graded, balanced and technology riven regime to handle vehicular pollution issue and instead of blanket ban, a scientific, data-driven framework should be developed taking into account all parameters to ascertain individual emission levels of vehicles.”Repeatedly stressing that the 2018 blanket ban order needs reconsideration, the BJP govt said vehicular pollution constitutes only one of the several sources of air-pollution, including stubble burning, biomass burning, road and construction dust, industrial emissions coupled with weather and meteorological factors and the intensity of pollution varies from season to season.Delhi govt said its transport department has strictly implemented PUC has resulted in issuance of 1,63,103 challans in the first seven months of this year, compared to 29,589 challans issued in 2021, 43,494 in 2022, 36,176 in 2023, and 68,077 in 2024. It said with the augmentation of CNG and electric buses and improvement in road infrastructure, the pollution caused by vehicles has reduced.It said the good AQI days have increased from 159 in 2018 to 209 in 2024 and good AQI days this year till July was 106. The robust implementation of Graded Response Plan (GRAP) has contributed to reducing pollution in the national capital, it said.","Delhi govt on friday requested the supreme court to reconsider its 2018 blanket ban on plying of over 10-year-old diesel and 15- year-old petrol vehicles.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes.","Sundar pichai is now worth $1.1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",Blackrock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to china.

Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The us federal communications commission (fcc) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between paramount global and skydance media.

Contractual service providers across more sectors will be eligible for business visas of up to 12 months.Govt sources said the UK has agreed not to impose numerical limits on Indian business mobility and won't require Indian companies to advertise locally before applying for these visas. Last year, the UK granted 25,117 visas under the Global Business Mobility route. The deal provides for 1,800 annual visas to Indian musicians, chefs and yoga teachers.Indian nurses, accountants and other professionals can look forward to academic qualifications being recognised in the UK, as the deal pushes for mutual recognition agreements.India has kept legal services out of bounds but agreed to let British accounting and audit firms set up shop here, provided the UK offers reciprocal access. Like in the Australian ECTA, architectural services are now open to British firms. The UK has made offers across 12 major services sectors and 137 sub-sectors.

NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost india's tiny 1.9% share of uk imports.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight. While import duty will come down from 150% to 75%, it is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of 2035.That's because the agreement will take at least a year to be ratified by the British Parliament and there is a gradual tariff reduction roadmap starting with duties in India dropping to 110% in the first year of implementation. The UK government said customs duty will reduce to 40% over the next decade.What's more, govt has got the UK to agree to a minimum import price which means, whisky, gin or any other drink that costs under $5 in a one litre bottle or $6 in a 750 ml bottle will get the tariff benefit and the MIP will be indexed to inflation.However, industry officials say that despite halving import duty, the actual reduction of consumer prices will not be more than 10%. ""The share of customs duty to the overall structure of MRP is hardly 15-20%, depending on the category. The rest comprises state govrnment taxes, and distribution margins. So actual consumer prices will come down by only 8-10%,"" an official said.The reduction in import duty will be a benefit for manufacturers of Indian Made Foreign Liquor.Around 80% of imported scotch is in bulk form, which is used for bottling in India and for blending by local whisky brands.But the industry cheered the move. Sanjit Padhi, CEO of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said the agreement paves the way for a more balanced and equitable trade environment, particularly as Indian alcohol exports to the UK have zero import duties.""We laud the Indian and British governments for formalising this historic treaty which will boost bilateral trade and positively impact the accessibility of premium Scotch whisky in India, reigniting growth and increased choice for Indian consumers,"" Praveen Someshwar, MD and CEO of Diageo India, said.","The much-anticipated duty cuts for scotch and gin is not happening overnight.

NEW DELHI: Government has agreed to cut tariffs on thousands of products imported from UK - from chocolates and cosmetics to cars, silver and Scotch - but reduction and elimination of customs duties will not translate into the entire benefit being passed on to consumers.To begin with, customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller. On top of that are local levies - GST or excise - which even an Indian manufacturer has to pay. And, this can be a significant portion of the final price.Take the case of alcohol, for instance, where the landed price of a bottle of the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label is estimated at around Rs 350, which at 150% customs duty sees a levy of Rs 525. On top of that, there is a 200% margin for the importer, the company, in most cases - which means an addition of around Rs 750 - taking the landed price to Rs 1,275. Then comes excise of 85% or Rs 1,084 and VAT of 25% (Rs 590), taking the wholesale price to Rs 2,950. Then comes the retail margin, pushing the cost in a market like Delhi to over Rs 3,000 a bottle.The actual price reduction for a customer will only be Rs 200-300 a bottle, a top industry executive told TOI while predicting a higher margin for companies.That's especially true for Made-in-India whisky, which blend anywhere between 1% and 25-30% Scotch imported in bulk form. ""Going forward, for several MNCs operating in India, bottling in India may not be a great idea and they will simply import bottles of blended whisky,"" the source said.A similar situation is likely to play out in other sectors such as cosmetics too, where companies will see improved margins, said marketing executives. There is no mechanism for govt to ensure the full benefit is passed on. Although it tried to ensure the window is no longer available under GST and in any case, companies dragged authorities to court, questioning the calculations.In segments such as automobiles, competition from players will drive pricing behaviour, as will other trade agreements. For instance, with the EU deal in the pipeline, a German carmaker or Tesla may just lower domestic prices significantly to grab a bigger pie of the market.With duty reduction in several segments staggered over 10 years, price cuts are not on the immediate horizon.","Customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an indian seller.

NEW DELHI: India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars with the UK trade deal paving the way for customs charges to come down from the highs of 100%+ to as low as 10%, benefitting ultra-luxury car brands such as Jaguar and Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.However, the government has delayed the import duty concessions when it comes to electrics and other green cars, the measure being initiated to protect the domestic players who are looking to produce high-value clean cars. “There are no concessions given to electrics, hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the first five years,” an official said.In petrol and diesel categories, the lower tariffs can be enjoyed for a limited number of vehicles as the government has imposed quotas and limits to protect the domestic makers and also curb mass-scale shipments.For large-engine petrol cars above 3000 cc and diesel cars over 2500 cc — traditionally luxury imports — India has committed to lowering the current 100%+ customs duty to 10% over 15 years, within a quota starting at 10,000 units and rising to 19,000 in year five, according to a review document of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).For mid-sized cars (1500–2500 cc diesel / up to 3000 cc petrol), a 50% in-quota duty applies initially, falling to 10% by year five.Small cars under 1500 cc follow a similar tariff reduction path with a growing quota. “These in-quota vehicles enjoy sharply reduced duties, while out-of-quota imports still face tariffs ranging from 95% to 50%, depending on vehicle size and year,” GTRI said.In electrics, market access has been given mostly in the high price segment of vehicles priced above £80,000 (around Rs 94 lakh). “For vehicles priced below £40,000, no market access provided, ensuring complete protection for the mass-market EV segment in which India seeks global leadership,” the official said.While the duty cuts will happen only once the UK Parliament approves the agreement (possibly by the middle of next year), analysts believe that the duty reduction with the UK may pave the way for similar measures with other countries and trading blocs as well. “This is India’s first-ever auto tariff concession in any FTA, and it’s likely to trigger similar demands from Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the U.S.,” GTRI said.“By year five, up to 37,000 UK-built ICE vehicles could enter India annually at just 10% duty — far below the current base rate of 110%. This creates a preferential entry path for high-end British brands… but also for other UK-based exports. While the measure is capped in volume and spread over 15 years, the policy sets a precedent in opening India’s tightly controlled automobile market to bilateral trade partners—potentially triggering similar demands in future FTAs. ”",India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars.

Dubai’s real estate market is not just having a good year, it’s having its best one yet. In the first six months of the year, the market recorded its strongest mid-year performance to date. Total real estate transactions reached over AED 431 billion (approx. $117 billion) representing a 25 percent year-on-year increase. This growth was not only driven by property sales, but also by a wider set of real estate procedures that reflect a healthy and active market.Behind these numbers is a combination of policy changes, local and foreign investor confidence, and the steady expansion of supporting sectors such as real estate brokerage. Government strategies like the Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the First Time Home Buyer Program have made it easier for residents and new investors to enter the market, while improved digital infrastructure and regulatory clarity have reduced friction in buying and selling property.This is not a short-term trend. The numbers show increasing participation from UAE residents, first-time buyers, and professionals working in real estate services, indicating that the market’s growth is built on a broad base.Real estate brokers have played a central role in Dubai’s property surge this year. In the first half of 2025, 42,181 transactions were completed through brokers. These deals generated more than AED 3.23 billion (approx. $880 million), in commissions, nearly double the AED 1.62 billion ($440 million) earned in the same period in 2024.
