Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint, says SC

New Delhi: In a significant departure from one-size-fits-all penalty approach, the SC has said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment and it would be justifiable to impose higher penalties on mega firms for environment damage caused by them, reports Dhananjay MahapatraThis decision by Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi was given while dismissing appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance in Pune.Justice Datta rejected the arguments of the two realtors that the penalty imposed was disproportionate.The court also rejected the arguments that NGT did not have the jurisdiction or power to arbitrarily impose such high environmental damage compensation charges.Justice Datta said through the NGT Act the legislature has deliberately given the tribunal discretion to grant relief based on the seriousness of environmental harm.The core of appellant’s arguments was that turnover or project cost cannot be taken as a metric for determination of environmental compensation. “We are unable to accede to such a submission. Neither NGT Act nor the jurisprudence of this court calls for the adoption of a uniform formula for the quantification of environmental compensation,” the bench said.The Supreme Court further said that: “In cases relating to protection of environment, linking a company’s scale of operations (like turnover, production volume, or revenue generation) to the environmental harm can be a powerful factor for determining compensation.”“Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint. Larger scale means more resource use, more emissions, more waste leading to more environmental stress. If a company profits more from its scale, it is logical that it bears more responsibility for the environmental costs. Linking scale to impact sends a message that bigger players need to play by greener rules,” it said.",Supreme court says bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment.

While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available.

Where and how the alternative halftime show will be streamed

As Super Bowl LX draws closer, Turning Point USA has taken a key step toward turning its long-discussed halftime concept into something viewers can actually access. The conservative nonprofit first teased its alternative event months ago, pitching it as a response to the NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the official halftime show. That announcement sparked attention across political and sports media, but the details were scarce.Turning Point USA has now revealed that its event, branded as “The All-American Halftime Show,” will be streamed live across several major digital platforms. Fans will be able to watch through their official YouTube channel, as well as on Charlie Kirk’s personal YouTube account. The organization also confirmed that the stream will be available on its Twitter and Rumble pages.Beyond social platforms, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) announced a lineup of television and streaming partners expected to carry the broadcast. That list includes The Daily Wire, Real America’s Voice, Trinity Broadcasting Network, Charge!, The National News Desk, New Tang Dynasty, and One America News. The organization shared this information through its website and social media accounts, presenting the wide distribution as a sign of strong interest in alternative Super Bowl programming.Still, much about the show remains unknown. Turning Point USA has not named any musical performers or speakers that will be present for the show. A spokesperson previously said that participants would not be revealed until the broadcast begins, as the organization’s website still reads, “More info & musical artists to be announced.”Questions also remain about its format, as Turning Point USA has not confirmed whether the show will be live or pre-recorded, nor has it released promotional clips or rehearsal footage. Compared to the NFL’s tightly choreographed halftime spectacle, the alternative broadcast and its strategy for the said event still remain a mystery.The NFL has declined to comment and continues to focus on its official Super Bowl LX plans. For now, viewers know where to tune in if they want to watch the alternate event.

Kayla Nicole swarmed by Swifties in what critics call online stalking

A single tap on Instagram was enough to reignite a familiar online storm. Kayla Nicole found herself trending again after fans noticed she had liked a post involving her ex, Travis Kelce . What began as a routine interaction quickly turned into a flashpoint, drawing intense reactions across social media and reopening long standing tensions tied to Kelce’s highly public relationship.The post itself had nothing to do with romance. Shared by Bleacher Report, it highlighted Travis and his brother Jason helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan ahead of her Winter Olympics debut. The caption praised their generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” Still, attention shifted away from the charitable act once screenshots showed Nicole’s verified account had liked the post.Fans protective of Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift reacted swiftly. Screenshots spread fast, followed by harsh commentary. Some people said Nicole was just trying to get attention, while others wondered why the interaction was being made bigger in the first place. Kayla Nicole has been under a lot of online scrutiny since she broke up with Kelce in 2022, and the backlash added to that.This wasn't the first time people looked closely at what she did.People have seen past fashion posts and pop culture references as subtle digs, whether they were meant to be or not. Nicole has largely stayed silent during these moments, choosing not to respond publicly as speculation grows around her every move.The renewed focus also comes as the Kelce family continues to make headlines of their own. Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently sparked conversation during interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors. When asked who she hoped to avoid on the show, she said, “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries. That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.”That remark only fueled discussion further. In today’s social media climate, even the smallest interaction can carry oversized meaning. For Kayla Nicole, a single like became another reminder that public history never fully stays in the past, especially when fans are watching every move.","Kayla nicole faced renewed online backlash after fans noticed she liked an instagram post involving her ex, travis kelce.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

What Andrej Karpathy said in his post on X

I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from ""how is this interesting at all"" all the way to ""it's so over"".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing.

And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other.

So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many

LLM agents

(150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago

""The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope."", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am ""overhyping"" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.","Openai's founding team member andrej karpathy said in his post on x that he was being accused of overhyping the site.

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future.People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past. A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out.People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Quote of the day by sam altman: ""humans who use ai will replace those who don’t"" use ai to help you with everyday tasks like making notes, scheduling, and doing research so you can spend more time on important work.

Tech companies have welcomes her decision. Here’s what they said:

Sanjay Chitkara, Co-CSMO, LG Electronics India Limited

The

Union Budget 2026

reinforces India’s ambition to become a global high-tech manufacturing hub through higher capital investment, Semiconductor Mission 2.0, and expanded support for electronics component manufacturing. Measures such as duty exemptions, MSME funding, and improved infrastructure will strengthen supply chains and enhance industry competitiveness. This creates a stronger ecosystem for localized manufacturing, innovation, and long-term growth. At the same time, tax rationalization and policies aligned with middle-class needs will boost consumption and job creation, delivering balanced growth for both industry and citizens.

Muneer Ahmad Khant Managing Director at ViewSonic India

India’s Budget 2026 sends a strong signal that the future of growth lies at the intersection of education, technology, and industry. The proposed Education-to-Employment Standing Committee, along with initiatives such as Content Creator Labs across 15,000 schools and plans for university townships near industry corridors, reflect a clear intent to align learning with real-world skills, particularly in emerging areas like AI and advanced technologies.

Coupled with an effective capital expenditure of ₹17.14 lakh crore and continued momentum toward domestic manufacturing and a robust semiconductor ecosystem, the Budget lays a strong foundation for modern digital classrooms and future-ready campuses. This convergence of education, technology, and manufacturing is shaping India’s next phase of economic leadership.

Manoj Nair (Head of Applications at Fujitsu)

The Hon’ble Finance Minister has presented a forward-looking Union Budget that strongly reinforces India’s Viksit Bharat ambition, and conducive policies to make India a global technology hub.

There is a huge focus on AI by positioning it as a force multiplier, combined with robust policies to support the growth of data centres. The launch of the India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 will accelerate the development of a resilient semiconductor ecosystem, spanning materials, equipment, full-stack IP design, and enhancing supply chains.

The move to approve Safe Harbour for IT services through an automated, rule-based mechanism is a significant reform that enhances ease of doing business and provides certainty in taxation for the industry.

Equally encouraging is the focus on positioning data centres as critical infrastructure, along with the proposal to extend tax holidays till 2047 for global cloud service providers operating from India. Together, these measures will help in boosting investor confidence, enhance innovation, create long-term growth opportunities for semiconductor and IT services companies, including data centre players, while further strengthening India’s role in the global technology value chain.

Avneet Singh Marwah

, CEO, SPPL, exclusive brand licensee for Blaupunkt, Kodak and Thomson in India

Budget 2026-27 provides a strong platform to accelerate the growth of India’s semiconductor and electronics manufacturing ecosystem. If India has to become competitive globally, the focus should shift from announcement to execution. Design-linked incentives, deeper component localisation and semiconductor-linked supply chains are critical to help Indian manufacturers climb up the value chain.

Arijeet Talapatra

, CEO, TECNO India

This budget reinforces India’s shift from scale to substance in electronics manufacturing. As the country deepens its semiconductor and electronics capabilities, it opens the door to large-scale, future-ready employment, especially for young engineers, technicians and skilled workers who will drive the next phase of growth.

The focus on semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and stronger supply chains gives the smartphone industry exactly what it needs to build long-term value, not just volume. We see Semiconductor Mission 2.0 as a long-term enabler for affordable innovation and our commitment to Make in India is for the long run. These measures create the right foundation for us to localise deeper, innovate faster, and design technology that is truly made for Indian users to lead globally.

Tadashi Chiba, MD & CEO, Panasonic India

The Government’s consistent focus on infrastructure continues to be central to India’s growth agenda. The Union Budget 2026–27, with capital expenditure increased to Rs 12.2 lakh crore, reaffirms infrastructure as the backbone of India’s economic expansion. This sustained push will directly support the scaling of Panasonic’s advanced B2B solutions and offerings, which are integral to large-scale infrastructure development. The continued focus on strengthening India’s manufacturing ecosystem through ECMS and the exemption of basic customs duty on select electrical appliances, including microwaves, is a timely measure that will improve cost efficiencies, encourage domestic value creation, and boost market adoption.

The emphasis on the strategic deployment of cutting-edge technologies, including AI, to improve governance and productivity, will lay a strong foundation for inclusive, sustainable, and people-centric growth in India.

Rajeev Singh, Managing Director, BenQ India and South Asia

The Union Budget 2026 makes a clear statement on reimagining education as a direct driver of employability and economic growth. The proposed Education-to-Employment Standing Committee acknowledges the urgent need to align learning with industry demand and the accelerating impact of technologies such as artificial intelligence.

Initiatives such as Content Creator Labs in 15,000 schools and the development of university townships near industry corridors mark an important shift towards hands-on, technology-enabled, and industry-connected learning environments. These measures will encourage creativity, collaboration, and real-world skill development across K-12 and higher education.

Together with continued support for domestic manufacturing and the semiconductor ecosystem, the Budget creates a strong foundation for modern digital classrooms and future-ready campuses. It enables education and enterprise technology providers to play a meaningful role in building skills, improving learning outcomes, and preparing India’s talent base for global competitiveness. It will be good to see how these initiatives take shape in the coming days, and we will support them to the best of our ability.

Ravi Agarwal, Co-Founder and Managing Director, Cellecor

The Union Budget 2026 reflects a steady and constructive approach toward strengthening India’s consumer electronics and technology manufacturing ecosystem. The near doubling of the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme outlay from Rs 22,919 crore to Rs 40,000 crore is a meaningful step toward building a stronger domestic component supply chain. Alongside the expansion of the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0 into a broader, full-stack programme covering materials, equipment, design, and R&D, this signals strong momentum toward positioning India higher on the global electronics value chain.

The parallel focus on employment generation and large-scale skilling in electronics manufacturing and emerging technologies will help create a future-ready workforce across factories, assembly lines, and service ecosystems. Overall, the Budget creates a supportive environment for consumer electronics brands to invest with confidence. We look forward to contributing to this growth journey through innovation, localisation, and product development.

Avi Avula, President, Applied Materials India

India Semiconductor Mission 2.0, announced in the Union Budget 2026, is a positive step towards strengthening India’s semiconductor ecosystem. We are proud to contribute through our growing capabilities designed to accelerate research and innovation in partnership with industry and academia.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday (February 1) launched the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) 2.0, and announced waiving customs duty on TV equipment, camera and other instruments imported by a foreign film unit or TV team for shooting films removed from April 1. She also announced, customs duty exemption on video game manufacturing parts removed from April 1. Speaking in Parliament, the Minister outlined a vision to move India beyond assembly and into the high-value sectors of semiconductor intellectual property (IP) and raw materials.“India's semiconductor mission, 1.0 expanded India's semiconductor sector capabilities. Building on this, we launch ISM 2.0 to produce equipment and materials, develop full-stack Indian IP, and strengthen supply chains.We will also focus on industry-led research and training centers to develop technology and a skilled workforce,” Sitharaman said in the Parliament.","Budget 2026 signals infra first strategy with public capital expenditure raised to ₹12.2 lakh crore.tech companies have welcomes her decision.

As of January 2026, the mid-range smartphone market in India has reached a significant milestone in mobile photography. No longer are professional-grade features like periscope telephoto lenses or massive 200MP sensors reserved for flagship devices costing upwards of seventy thousand rupees. The sub-Rs 30,000 market is very competitive right now, with brands like Realme, Motorola, and Nothing pushing the limits of what affordable hardware can do. This change is happening because of a new generation of Image Signal Processors (ISPs) that work better in low light and have a wider dynamic range.For users, this means that high-quality vlogging, detailed zoom photography, and studio-level portraits are now available on a mid-range budget.This is the best time for anyone who wants to make content to upgrade.The Realme 15 5G has a 50 MP Sony IMX882 AI main camera with OIS and an 8 MP ultra-wide lens. It also has a lot of photo and video modes, such as 4K recording, dual-view video, night, portrait, panorama, and slow motion. The front-facing camera has 50 MP and can shoot 4K video and a number of other types of videos, making it perfect for creators. The phone also has a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 144 Hz, a Dimensity 7300+ 5G chipset, a 7000 mAh battery that charges quickly at 80 W, and dual-SIM 5G connectivity.The Motorola Edge 70 has a great camera setup with three elements: a 50 MP main sensor with OIS, a 50 MP ultrawide lens, and an extra light sensor to improve exposure and detail. The front camera has 50 MP and can take high-resolution selfies and record video in 4K. The phone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset, a 5000 mAh battery that charges quickly at 68 W, and IP68/IP69 durability. It also has a 6.7-inch Super HD pOLED display that refreshes at 120 Hz.The Phone (3a) Pro is still causing problems in the market, focusing on a ""true-to-life"" photography philosophy. Nothing's 50MP main sensor takes pictures with realistic skin tones and balanced shadows, unlike competitors that make images too bright. The 50MP periscope lens makes portrait compression look great, so it's perfect for headshots that look professional. Nothing OS is clean and free of bloatware, which keeps the camera app fast and responsive so it never misses a key moment when you're shooting quickly.The Vivo T4 Pro prioritises flagship-level imaging with a 50 MP Sony OIS main camera and a 50 MP Sony 3x periscope telephoto lens for sharp zoomed shots, supported by a 32 MP front selfie camera for detailed portrait and video capture. It features a 6.77″ quad-curved AMOLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and up to 5000 nits brightness, a Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset, 6500 mAh battery with 90 W fast charging, and IP68/IP69 dust- and water-resistance for everyday durability.The Motorola Edge 60 Pro has a great camera system with a 50 MP OIS main sensor, a 50 MP ultra-wide lens, and a 10 MP 3x telephoto camera.

However, the company is still several months away from unveiling its first foldable iPhone, a device positioned at the very top of the lineup to create a halo effect across the portfolio. Apple’s first foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style design, opening horizontally just like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series. However, now a new online report suggests that the Cupertino-based tech giant is considering a smaller clamshell design for its first foldable iPhone.According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is exploring the idea of introducing a smaller and compact clamshell-style foldable iPhone.Informally referred to as the ‘iPhone Flip’, the smartphone would fold vertically and turn into a compact square form factor similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and the Motorola Razr. Gurman adds that the prototypes of such designs have been tested inside Apple labs but it is not clear as to when the product will reach the customers.“Now there’s another foldable device under consideration inside Apple labs (and it won’t come as a shock given what Motorola and Samsung Electronics Co.have already done): a square, clamshell-style foldable phone. Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand for the category and that customers will want additional shapes and sizes, much as they have with traditional slab-style iPhones,” adds the report.Apple has also been working on a giant foldable iPad, but that project has reportedly hit development snags.

A virtual journey through Doha





Sama and Qatar Airways’ digital ecosystem





Gaming, travel intent, and real-world rewards





Backed by next-generation connectivity









Qatar Airways has stepped into the gaming world with the launch of its first-ever digital destination inside Fortnite, unveiling QVerse Island as an immersive platform that blends virtual exploration with real-world travel inspiration. The initiative reimagines Doha inside a popular online environment, offering players a mission-driven experience designed to engage potential travellers long before they begin planning a trip.QVerse Island recreates Qatar’s capital within Fortnite’s creative universe, allowing players to explore recreated versions of Doha’s landmarks and attractions. The experience begins at Hamad International Airport, setting the tone for a journey that mirrors the start of an actual trip.Players move through the island by completing fun, mission-based challenges that take them across recognisable locations, including themed areas such as The ORCHARD. The design encourages exploration, with hidden zones scattered across the island where players can uncover golden tickets. These tickets unlock chances to win flights and travel-related rewards, directly linking in-game discovery to tangible travel incentives.Guiding players throughout the experience is Sama, Qatar Airways’ digital cabin crew avatar. Sama introduces destinations, leads challenges, and acts as the in-world companion across the island. Her role in Fortnite builds on her presence across the airline’s wider digital ecosystem, which includes the QVerse immersive web experience, online brand storytelling, experiential activations, and interactive platforms.Qatar Airways said Sama’s integration into Fortnite strengthens continuity across its digital identity, extending the airline’s brand into a space where global audiences already spend significant time. By placing a familiar digital figure at the centre of the experience, the airline aims to create a consistent and recognisable connection between virtual engagement and its real-world services.The airline said travel inspiration is increasingly shaped through digital platforms, including social media and immersive gaming environments. By launching QVerse Island, Qatar Airways is positioning itself within these ecosystems to engage travellers well before they actively search for their next destination.By bringing Doha into Fortnite, the airline aims to bridge virtual exploration with physical travel. The strategy is designed to turn digital curiosity into real journeys, using interactive gameplay, rewards, and brand experiences to influence travel intent at an early stage.The launch of QVerse Island also aligns with Qatar Airways’ broader investment in next-generation digital services. A key pillar of this strategy is the rollout of Starlink connectivity across its fleet. Qatar Airways currently operates more than 120 Starlink-enabled aircraft, making it the world’s largest widebody fleet equipped with ultra-high-speed in-flight internet.According to the airline, passengers on Starlink-powered flights can access Wi-Fi speeds of up to 500 Mbps on routes spanning six continents, including the Americas, Australia, and major destinations across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.","Qatar airways launched qverse island in fortnite, letting players explore doha and unlock flight rewards.
