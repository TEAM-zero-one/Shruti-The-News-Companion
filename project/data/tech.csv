DGCA submits restructuring report to govt; dedicated system for protecting consumer interest likely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-submits-restructuring-report-to-govt-dedicated-system-for-protecting-consumer-interest-likely/articleshow/125443924.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a major reform to strengthen aviation safety oversight and better protect air travellers’ interests, India has set the old plan of restructuring the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like SEBI or TRAI into motion. A Parliamentary panel had sought the restructuring to give teeth to the regulator as air traffic has grown exponentially in the last decade while in its current setup the DGCA battles legacy issues like staff shortage which can’t be tackled at the required pace.Based on the parliamentary committee’s advice and directions of the Union aviation ministry, the DGCA prepared a report outlining its proposed restructuring. The same is learnt to have been submitted this week to the ministry, including secretary Samir Kumar Sinha who is keen on having an autonomous aviation regulatory body on the lines of telecom and securities market regulators (TRAI & SEBI). Highly placed sources say the restructuring will happen in a “staggered manner” after the ministry takes a view on the DGCA report.It is learnt that the proposed restructuring of DGCA into CAA may also put in place a dedicated system to protect consumer interests and ensure their grievances are promptly redressed.The proposed CAA with statutory status will also see the latter getting a funding mechanism with the options being levying a small charge on flyers. A self-funded regulator not dependent on govt for grants will be able to offer market-linked salaries competitively to attract talent and invest in latest technology for effective oversight.The idea of having a truly autonomous Civil Aviation Authority has been in the works for years but it has got a push in recent times due to the growth in India’s air traffic with airlines having close to 2,000 planes on order; dozens of new airports opening and the skies getting crowded requiring more safety oversight.DGCA manpower didn’t keep pace with the growing air traffic. It recently started creating a “pool” of its retired technical officers “to provide advisory support in the certification process” due to the manpower crunch. “It has often been observed that applicants and entities face difficulties navigating the entire process, leading to delays and compliance challenges,” the regulator admits in its note for creating this pool.",India has set the old plan of restructuring the directorate general of civil aviation into a financially and administratively autonomous organisation like sebi or trai into motion.

Surat evaluates electric freight vehicles under clean air programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surat-evaluates-electric-freight-operations-under-clean-air-programme/articleshow/125439609.cms,"Representative AI image

Surat recently concluded a pilot programme testing electric freight vehicles at the Surat Textile Market to assess their feasibility and potential to cut emissions from commercial transport.The initiative involved deployment of electric small commercial vehicles (e-SCVs) and light commercial vehicles (e-LCVs) across multiple logistics stages in the market, one of the city's largest trading hubs. While full data analysis is still in progress, preliminary findings suggest lower operating costs and reduced tailpipe emissions compared to conventional diesel vehicles.The pilot forms part of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s measures under the National Clean Air Programme. The project was undertaken in collaboration with WRI India, Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), Switch Mobility and Euler Motors.Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of India’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets. According to officials, the majority of these trips are handled by over 7,500 diesel, petrol and CNG-powered vehicles, contributing substantially to local emissions.Representatives from the textile traders' associations and partner organisations said the pilot offers insights on fleet operations and could help inform future policy and investments in commercial e-mobility. The programme is part of WRI India’s Accelerator for Clean Air Actions and a larger UNEP-led project supported by the Global Environment Facility, with guidance from NITI Aayog.","Surat, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of india’s man-made fabric production, sees around 21,000 freight trips daily across 250 markets.

ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

BENGALURU: Scientists at Isro ’s Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves out of the inner Solar system after its recent perihelion passage.Using PRL’s 1.2m telescope at Mount Abu, researchers observed the comet between Nov 12 and 15. The images show a near-circular coma, the cloud of gas and dust that forms around a comet’s nucleus when solar heating causes surface ices to sublimate.“In the present geometry, any dust tail would lie behind the comet relative to the Earth, while deeper multiband images could reveal the ion tail,” Isro said.Ahead of morning twilight, the team also recorded a spectrum of the comet’s light. It showed clear emission features associated with Solar system comets, including CN, C2 and C3 bands at shorter wavelengths.“Researchers calculated the production rates of these molecular emissions, which describe how much gas is released from the nucleus into the coma. For 3I/ATLAS, the values are around 10²⁵ molecules per second. The ratios of these rates place the object among the ‘typical comets’ of the Solar system despite its interstellar origin,” Isro said.PRL’s Mount Abu telescope, situated at an altitude of 1,680m near Gurushikhar, supports studies ranging from exoplanets to high-energy sources. The team plans further observations as 3I/ATLAS moves into darker skies.","Scientists at isro ’s physical research laboratory (prl) have captured new images and spectra of the interstellar comet 3i/atlas.

The Hunt family adds its own touch to Taylor Swift's engagement gift





More NFL coverage

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift ’s engagement has sparked reactions all across sports and entertainment, but one of the most meaningful responses came from inside the Kansas City Chiefs family. Gracie Hunt, who has gotten to know Swift during her time around the team, recently shared a personal story about how she decided to congratulate the couple. Fans already knew the Hunts and Swift had formed a friendly bond, but her new comments showed just how thoughtful that connection has become over time.Swift’s engagement announcement went viral in August and quickly turned into one of the biggest pop culture moments of the year. Messages poured in from fellow celebrities, friends, and fans, and Gracie was among the many who celebrated the couple’s big news. Yet she explained that she wanted to do something more personal than post a comment online. During her appearance on The Will Cain Show, Gracie recalled choosing a gift that holds special meaning in her own family. She said she turned to jewelry designer Monica Kosann because the pieces carry stories and memories that have mattered to her for years.While discussing that choice, she said, “My grandmother wore Monica’s pieces and she’s so excellent at storytelling through her artistry and I actually gave Taylor an engagement present. It was one of Monica’s necklaces because they mean so much to me.”Gracie’s gesture was not the only one Swift received from the Hunt family. Her mother, Tavia Hunt, also sent a gift to mark the engagement. The gift arrived wrapped in a custom design created by Dallas Gift Wrap Creations, and the presentation immediately caught attention for its elegance and small symbolic details. The wrapping placed heavy emphasis on romantic elements. It featured florals inspired by the garden proposal, a pink bow decorated with rhinestones, and a three-dimensional butterfly that echoed Swift’s “Lover” era.This was not the first time the Hunts gave Swift something special. For her 34th birthday, the family surprised her with a crystal Judith Leiber Hot Mic clutch. Gracie shared a photo of the moment and added a warm birthday message, writing, “Happy birthday to this queen! Bright, beautiful, beyond talented and engaging…easiest decision Time Magazine ever made for Person of the Year. Hope it’s your best & most blessed year yet!”","Gracie hunt marked taylor swift and travis kelce’s engagement with a sweet gift.

How Roblox’s facial age-estimation technology estimates your age



Who can chat with whom on Roblox: Age brackets and rules



Roblox’s privacy and safety: New policies for chat and moderation



Why Roblox says it is doing this now



Related FAQs for parents and users



Do children lose all chat features?

Children under 13 will be restricted from most chats with adults and older teens by default; under-9 chat is off unless a parent consents after verification. Peer-to-peer chat among similar-aged users remains possible depending on the age bracket.

What if the age check is wrong?

Roblox says users can appeal an age estimate by providing a government ID or obtaining parental verification; the company has described a 48-hour window to verify if someone believes they were misclassified. Reported flows vary by market.

Will the selfie or ID be stored?

Roblox has stated that the selfie used for age estimation will not be stored; the company also offers ID-based verification, wherea government ID is submitted and processed under privacy safeguards. Independent privacy reviews have been requested by advocates.

Are private chats still monitored?

Yes, Roblox currently does not use end-to-end encryption for private chats, enabling automated and human moderation to detect abuse and policy violations. The company says this monitoring will continue and is a key part of its safety controls.





Roblox, the global online game and social platform with more than 150 million daily users, has announced a major update to how users can communicate: a new age-based chat system that uses facial age-estimation and other age-verification methods to limit conversations between children and much older users. The company says the change prompted by lawsuits and growing scrutiny of child safety online will place users into narrow age cohorts (for example: under 9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20 and 21+) and block most cross-age private chats unless specific trust or parental-consent steps are taken. Roblox frames the move as a new industry safety standard and plans a phased rollout starting in December 2025 (pilot markets) with global enforcement in January 2026. The following article explains what Roblox will do, how the technology works, what alternatives exist, and what experts, advocates and parents have said so far, strictly reporting facts and official claims with up-to-date sourcing.Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check. The platform will estimate a user’s age using a live selfie video processed by a third-party age-estimation provider (Persona), or users can verify age with a government ID or parental consent where required.Based on that estimate or verification, Roblox assigns an age bracket and allows chat only with users in the same or nearby brackets. Under-9 accounts will have chat turned off by default unless a parent provides permission after verification. Roblox says images used for the facial check will not be stored.Roblox is starting the new system with a voluntary age-check period immediately and will enforce mandatory age checks in phases. The company has said it will begin the first enforced rollouts in December 2025 in countries including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, followed by a broader, global enforcement in January 2026 for markets where chat features are available. Users will see in-app prompts to verify age; those who decline may lose access to some communication features.Roblox’s public explanation is that the platform will use a vendor-supplied algorithm to estimate age from a short live selfie video. Roblox executives say the system is calibrated to estimate ages roughly between 5 and 25 with an accuracy window of about one to two years; the company also offers alternatives such as uploading a government ID or using parental verification if a user disputes an estimate. The live selfie flow is intended to detect “liveness” (a real person) and to avoid spoofing with photos. Roblox has emphasised that the selfie is analysed and the platform does not retain the raw image, though privacy advocates note that implementation details matter for trust.Roblox will place accounts into defined age buckets (reported examples: under-9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20, 21+). Chat permissions are then limited so younger users cannot initiate or sustain conversations with significantly older users. For example, a pre-teen placed in the 9–12 group would be prevented from privately messaging users assigned to the 18–20 or 21+ cohorts, unless those relationships are converted into “trusted connections” (which require additional verification, such as confirming a real-world relationship). Roblox says the policy aims to reduce the possibility of adults posing as peers to groom minors.Roblox points out that private chats on the platform are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the platform can scan and moderate messages for policy violations; the company says this ability remains essential for child protection. Roblox also says the age checks will be paired with automated detection systems, human moderation and abuse-reporting tools. The policy updates are part of a broader safety push after lawsuits and media reports alleging that predators used the platform to contact minors.Roblox cites a wave of lawsuits and heightened regulatory scrutiny as a reason to strengthen age-assurance and limit adult-minor communications. The company frames the change as setting a new safety standard for interactive platforms, saying the technology and policies aim to reduce opportunities for grooming and exploitation while preserving legitimate social interactions among peers. Roblox’s safety team has published a company statement and blog post describing the rollout and the expected user experience.",Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check.

Rockstar Games once again delayed the launch of the highly anticipated title, Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6, earlier this month. The Take Two Interactive-owned game developer has now pushed the release to November 2026. However, the delay has not only disappointed GTA fans but has also significantly impacted competing game development studios as they plan their own content releases. The delay has offered Rockstar rival studios a window of relief.

Even Hideo Kojima noted thatfor the game.According to a report by IGN, Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, has also warned that GTA could draw engagement and revenue away from existing live-service titles such as Fortnite and Roblox, which are always competing for players’ attention.While some studios typically avoid factoring in competing releases, GTA 6 breaks that approach given its expected scale. However, one analyst believes its launch may still not address the industry’s broader challenges.Attention also remains on Rockstar’s internal issues. The company recently let go of over 30 employees, prompting the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain to accuse it of union-busting. In response, more than 200 current Rockstar staff members have signed letters calling for the reinstatement of their former colleagues.Moreover, recent rumours also claim that GTA 6 may launch on Nintendo's latest Switch 2 consoles.This week, Rockstar announced the latest GTA Online update, which brings new Listings Missions, a free executive office, property and vehicle discounts alongside several additional offers.","Rockstar games has pushed the release date of grand theft auto 6 to november 2026.

Why Gemini 3 could be a problem for OpenAI





The branding battle





Google has launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding. ” As reported by Business Insider, analysts are calling launch of Gemini 3 as the most aggressive move made by Google against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The launch of Gemini 3 makers a turning point in the AI race, as Google integrates Gemini 3 directly into Google Search from day one, allowing users to access the model instantly via an “AI mode” toggle — no separate app or download required.Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations. However, the real disruption lies in its distribution strategy:This end-to-end control means Google can scale Gemini faster and more efficiently than rivals who rely on external partnerships.OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still one of the most popular AI chatbot globally, but it has a limited ecosystem. It depends on partners for chips, cloud infrastructure, and distribution, whereas Google owns the entire pipeline. Google DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu emphasized this edge, “One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach.” With Gemini 3, Google is positioning itself as not just a competitor, but a direct alternative to ChatGPT across everyday search and productivity tools.Despite Google’s technical dominance, OpenAI still holds a crucial advantage: brand recognition. “ChatGPT” has become shorthand for AI in the public imagination, much like “Google” became synonymous with search.Analysts say Google has time — and money — to change that. With Gemini 3 offered free in some cases, Google could undercut rivals on price and flood the market with its model. Bernstein analyst Mark Schmulik told BI, “There’s no debate that Google has all the technical intangibles across the stack… but we need HARD evidence that they’re putting this all together. With Gemini 3, we may have just gotten some.”Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle to challenge OpenAI’s dominance.","Gemini 3 signals google’s full-throttle entry into the ai arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

Asmongold breaks down why xQc’s nomination holds despite Hasan’s frustration

“just chatting”

“just chatting.”





Controversy erupted after the Streamer Awards announced itsnominations, with xQc securing a spot while Hasan was entirely excluded. The decision immediately sparked debate across social platforms, where fans and creators questioned whether the nominations reflected genuine streaming contributions or behind-the-scenes preferences shaping the final list.Hasan expressed disappointment at being overlooked despite streaming hours of daily commentary, arguing his consistent format aligns more closely with the category than xQc’s sporadic chat-focused content. His frustration intensified after viewers pointed to xQc’s briefmoment with Donald Trump, a viral clip many felt hardly represented typicalcontent.The drama intensified when Asmongold stepped in, offering a more grounded explanation of how nomination decisions are made. He clarified that xQc’s Trump clip was not equivalent to Hasan’s daily political programming and wasn’t the determining factor behind the nomination. Instead, Asmongold suggested the awards often consider broader industry factors like brand safety, marketability, and committee preferences, which can outweigh pure content volume or consistency.Asmongold stated that Hasan’s hours of political streaming undoubtedly fit themold, but his outspoken stances may make him a riskier choice for organizers aiming for mainstream appeal.In contrast, xQc, despite occasionally diving into controversial spaces, remains one of the most recognizable and widely palatable figures in streaming, making him a safer option for high-visibility award categories. This explanation resonated with some fans, who agreed the awards frequently lean toward creators with broader commercial value rather than those who simply stream the most relevant content.The debate quickly expanded, with viewers questioning whether award shows can ever truly reflect merit when market positioning plays such a significant role. Critics argued that leaving Hasan off the list undermines the credibility of a category meant to celebrate conversational streamers, while supporters of xQc noted that popularity and cultural impact remain major factors in any entertainment award.As conversations continue, the dispute underscores a long-standing tension in the streaming world: the gap between community expectations and the opaque criteria used by award institutions. Whether Hasan’s absence is seen as an oversight or a strategic decision, the controversy has once again highlighted how subjective and politically influenced nomination processes can be, especially in categories as broad and competitive asAlso Read: Adin Ross to take legal action after Cuffem suffers major head injury at Carti concert","The streamer awards announced its nominations, with xqc securing a spot while hasan was entirely excluded.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

Rethinking the traditional cheque system

How the new monthly rent system will work





Pay rent through credit cards or direct debit on a month-to-month basis.

Integrate payments with existing digital wallets and banking applications.

Plan their budgets more effectively with predictable, smaller instalments.

Benefits for tenants, landlords, and the market





Reduced financial pressure from large upfront payments.

Residents in the UAE will soon be able to pay rent monthly instead of handing over large upfront sums, as the country prepares to phase out the long-standing “one-to-four” cheque system. The shift, set to begin in early 2026, promises greater flexibility for tenants, steadier income for landlords, and a more efficient, digitally integrated rental process.For decades, renting in the UAE has followed the “one-to-four” cheque model, where tenants are required to pay their entire annual rent upfront using one to four post-dated cheques. This system, long criticised for creating financial pressure, often limits housing choices and proves especially challenging for new residents.Keyper’s platform, now integrated with Property Finder, allows tenants to bypass this model entirely, replacing large lump-sum payments with monthly instalments via credit card or direct debit. The integration with digital wallets and banking apps is expected to make adoption seamless, easing the transition for residents accustomed to the old system.The monthly payment system is set to debut in early 2026 on select Property Finder listings before expanding nationwide.

"Central Bank of Oman approves “Maal” card fees, cutting merchant costs by up to 50%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/central-bank-of-oman-approves-maal-card-fees-cutting-merchant-costs-by-up-to-50/articleshow/125426915.cms,"Oman’s “Maal” card launches November 20, offering zero user fees and up to 50% lower merchant costs/Representative Image

What is “Maal” card?





A national card designed to reduce costs and expand inclusivity





Lower costs for merchants and banks





Lower caps for government entities

Fixed-fee model for money exchange and remittance companies

Preferential pricing for SME owners holding the “Riyada” card

Full fee exemption for charitable organizations when accepting zakat, sadaqat, and donations

Supporting digital growth

Launch and rollout plans





A majority of ATMs and e-commerce payment gateways will already be able to process “Maal” transactions.

Some customers may encounter POS terminals not yet upgraded, as banks continue to update their devices in phases.

The initial rollout focuses on high-traffic POS terminals and locations with strong transaction volumes to ensure stable adoption.





Oman has taken a major step toward building a unified, low-cost national payments ecosystem with the Central Bank of Oman’s newly approved fee structure for the “Maal” consumer debit and prepaid card. The framework eliminates key fees for users and service providers, lowers acceptance costs for merchants, and prepares the ground for a nationwide rollout following the card’s pilot launch on November 20, coinciding with National Day.The “Maal” card is Oman’s national consumer payment card introduced by the Central Bank of Oman to support a uniform, domestically managed digital payments system. It is issued in both debit and prepaid forms and is designed to offer individuals a secure, low-cost way to make electronic payments within the Sultanate. The card is provided without any issuance, reissuance, or annual fees, making it a zero-cost option for users. Operated through the OmanNet network, the “Maal” card enables payments across ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, and e-commerce platforms, and forms a key component of the country’s long-term strategy to localize and strengthen national payment infrastructure.The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) has finalized the fee framework that governs the “Maal” debit and prepaid card as part of its broader plan to build an efficient, nationally operated payments ecosystem.By removing financial barriers and streamlining digital payment access, the initiative supports individuals, merchants, government entities, and financial service providers.Consumers will receive the card with no fees for issuance, reissuance, or annual maintenance, ensuring that both debit and prepaid versions remain cost-free. Existing CBO regulations will continue to determine fees for ATM cash withdrawals and related services.This structure supports CBO’s mission to give residents a secure, low-cost digital payment tool that can be used easily within Oman, while also expanding financial inclusion across the country.A major component of the framework targets cost reduction across the payment value chain. During the early rollout, banks and payment service providers will not be charged for using the OmanNet infrastructure to issue or process “Maal” card transactions. This temporary exemption eases onboarding and motivates early adoption.The pricing model introduces capped Merchant Service Fees (MSF) for POS and e-commerce payments made with “Maal”. These caps are designed to be significantly more affordable than those applied to other cards, cutting the acceptance cost for merchants by up to 50%.CBO has also introduced differentiated caps and fee structures to ensure fairness and accessibility across sectors:These tailored measures ensure widespread access to digital payment solutions and encourage adoption in all parts of the economy.The “Maal” fee structure advances CBO’s strategy to strengthen the national payments ecosystem through the OmanNet network and reduce dependency on international schemes. By lowering costs and improving accessibility, the initiative is expected to increase electronic payment adoption, stimulate e-commerce growth, reduce financial burdens on consumers and merchants, and support a transition toward a less cash-dependent society.These outcomes align with Oman Vision 2040, which prioritizes the development of an inclusive, innovative, and sustainable digital economy.The fee framework accompanies the pilot launch of the “Maal” card on November 20, coinciding with Oman’s National Day celebrations. Participating banks will soon begin issuing the card, with broader distribution expanding in stages.During the soft-launch period:This phased approach ensures that acceptance grows steadily and efficiently across the Sultanate.","Oman’s “maal” card launches november 20, offering zero user fees and up to 50% lower merchant costs.
