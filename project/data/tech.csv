India is a dairy nation, but paradoxically, one that struggles to digest it. Between 60–74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers, according to studies by the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) and market research agencies such as Grand View Research. That makes the country one of the largest pools of lactose-intolerant consumers anywhere in the world.Yet awareness remains startlingly low. Studies by Beanery Foods reveal that fewer than 30% of urban, middle- and upper-class consumers even recognise their own intolerance. This mismatch, widespread prevalence but low recognition, has left the market largely underserved.At present, just a handful of brands are trying to address this gap. Most offerings are niche, metro-focused, or priced at a premium. The result? The everyday Indian consumer, particularly in semi-urban areas, has little access to lactose-free options. And yet, the case for lactose-free is no longer about niche health needs. It is shaping up to be the next big dairy wave in India. It is now mainstream, lifestyle-driven, and powered by rising health consciousness.Medical and nutritional research consistently shows how deep-rooted this issue is. A landmark study by SGPGI Lucknow found that nearly 74% of Indians are lactose mal-absorbers. Broader estimates place prevalence between 60–66% of the population, with India ranking among the top globally for intolerance.The numbers vary regionally. In Delhi, an earlier multicentre study pegged prevalence at just 27.4%, a reflection of North India’s genetic history of dairy farming and relatively higher lactase persistence. By contrast, in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, intolerance rates soar to 66–82%. For a country where milk is both a staple and a cultural symbol, this presents a striking paradox. Dairy is central to the Indian diet, but difficult for most Indians to digest.Despite this vast prevalence, the lactose-free dairy market in India is still at a nascent stage. According to MarkNtel Advisors, the market is projected to grow at a 7% CAGR through 2027, with some segments expected to expand at up to 14.8% CAGR by 2030. And yet, most supermarket shelves in metros stock only two or three brands offering lactose-free variants. The products that do exist are often premium-priced, targeted at niche audiences, and concentrated in big cities. This leaves a clear gap for players who can bring innovation, affordability, and wider distribution to the category, especially into Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets where intolerance rates are high.The opportunity, however, is not confined to those with medical intolerance. A growing wave of health-conscious Indians is embracing lactose-free products as a lifestyle choice. Lactose-free milk is naturally sweeter and creamier because the enzyme lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose, eliminating the need for added sugar while improving digestibility. This makes it attractive not only for daily consumption but also for indulgent formats such as flavoured milk, milkshakes, and desserts.The flavoured milk category is already booming, projected to grow at a 15.4% CAGR from 2024 to 2029, adding more than ₹6,000 crore in value. Similarly, the Indian milkshake market, valued at ₹7.6 billion in 2024, is forecast to reach ₹34.2 billion by 2033, growing at a robust 17.47% CAGR. For brands, this shift reframes lactose-free from a medical necessity into a mainstream lifestyle-driven category that promises both health and indulgence.The rise of no sugar and low sugar beverages in India dovetails perfectly with the lactose-free wave. In 2024, sales of no-sugar beverages doubled to ₹700–750 crore, now accounting for about 10% of the overall beverage market. Within dairy, however, the no-sugar ready-to-drink milkshake segment remains underserved. A few brands have launched protein shakes with zero sugar, but a comprehensive portfolio is missing. This creates space for lactose-free beverages sweetened with natural alternatives such as jaggery and dates, a preference that aligns with consumer demand for clean-label, functional indulgence. Government initiatives like the Eat Right India campaign further reinforce this trend by encouraging manufacturers to reduce refined sugar in foods and beverages.The profile of India’s lactose-free consumer is distinct. Unlike traditional dairy, where consumption cuts across all demographics, the early adopters here are younger, more urban, and more discerning. Millennials and Gen Z, especially those in the 25–30 age group, represent the highest consumption cohort. These are consumers who not only recognise the discomfort of lactose intolerance but also actively seek healthier, cleaner, and more functional options.Geographically, metros like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai are leading the trend, driven by exposure to global lifestyles and higher health awareness. But interestingly, the deeper potential lies in semi-urban South India, where lactose intolerance is more prevalent, with rates as high as 66–82% in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. West India, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra, is emerging as another hotspot, thanks to a vibrant dairy innovation ecosystem.What makes these consumers unique is not just their health consciousness but their taste preferences. Beanery Foods’ internal studies shows that more than 75% of urban Millennials and Gen Z prefer Indian-inspired flavours such as Rasmalai, Filter Kaapi, or Rose Kulfi over global standards like vanilla or strawberry. They are also overwhelmingly skewed toward clean-label products with over 90% of respondents revealing their preference for beverages without refined sugar, and with strong interest in natural sweeteners like jaggery and dates.Behind the rise of every successful food category in India lies a quiet enabler which is the packaging & processing technology. For lactose-free to scale, packaging technology is now a critical requirement. The UHT milk market in India, already valued at USD 7.75 billion in 2024, is projected to nearly double to USD 15.53 billion by 2034, growing at 7.2% CAGR. This growth is underpinned by one simple advantage which is the fact that UHT packaging allows milk and milk-based beverages to remain safe for six months without refrigeration.In a country where cold chain infrastructure is uneven, this single factor removes one of the biggest barriers to scale. It allows products to travel further, last longer, and remain safe without adding cost or logistical complexity. For retailers, it means lower spoilage and easier inventory management. For consumers, it provides hygienic, ready-to-drink convenience that matches modern on-the-go lifestyles.Solutions like Tetra Pak’s aseptic cartons are playing a critical role in this ecosystem, enabling safe, long-lasting lactose-free products that can reach far beyond metro shelves.Startups are already proving how this category can be reimagined. Zumi, a Hyderabad-based venture, has launched lactose-free, protein-rich milkshakes in flavours inspired by India’s culinary heritage, from Rasmalai to Rose Kulfi. Each 200ml pack delivers 7–8 grams of protein, is sweetened with natural alternatives like jaggery and dates, and comes in hygienic, ready-to-drink Tetra Pak cartons.Backed by Startup India and supported by Tetra Pak’s product development expertise, Zumi represents a new wave of Indian food innovation, clean-label, functional, and rooted in local taste preferences.“We are excited to serve the ever-conscious Indian consumer with our clean, lactose-free, no refined sugar milkshakes and redefine how India snacks and indulges. At ZUMI, our vision is to make better-for-you indulgence a joyful, guilt-free choice for everyone, combining nutrition with exceptional taste”, Thapasya Vijayaraghavan, Founder of Zumi Foods says.Lactose-free is no longer a fringe alternative. It solves a real health challenge that affects a majority of Indians, while also tapping into the aspirations of a younger, lifestyle-conscious consumer base. At the same time, it aligns seamlessly with broader trends shaping the food and beverage industry with cleaner labels, reduced sugar, functional indulgence, and on-the-go convenience.For dairy players, the timing could not be better. The category is expanding steadily, awareness is rising, and packaging solutions have made it possible to distribute safe, long-lasting products across India’s vast geography. What was once a niche product for a select few is now poised to become a mainstream choice for millions.For both startups looking to innovate and established brands aiming to diversify, lactose-free represents more than just an opportunity; it is the next big wave in Indian dairy, carrying the promise of scale, inclusivity, and long-term consumer loyalty.Disclaimer :","Between 60–74% of indians are lactose mal-absorbers.

The Buffalo Sabres are once again facing tough roster decisions to end their 14-year playoff drought. Amidst a slow start in the season, and losing their first three games, it is speculated that the Buffalo may hold a massive sell-off of talent to rebuild another. Their inconsistent performance has frustrated fans and analysts, which prompted this speculation that the team could soon enter sell-off mode if things don’t improve. However, it is still seen as a media conjecture, and nothing has been confirmed so far.Amidst a very slow start, the NHL team Buffalo Sabres , is currently facing trade speculation amidst their constant struggle to win. The team started the season with a slow start, although they managed to win two games in a row, which temporarily alleviated concerns about their poor start. However, those concerns returned after they lost 4–2 to the Montreal Canadiens on Monday.Their inconsistent performance has frustrated fans and NHL analysts alike, and rumors are circulating that the general manager, Kevyn Adams, may consider trading established players to create space for younger talent and future flexibility.Amidst the ongoing speculation, defenseman Rasmus Dahlin is viewed as the biggest name.However, his $11 million annual salary through the 2031–32 season, combined with a full no-movement clause, would greatly restrict the list of teams that he could be traded to. Meanwhile, fellow blueliners Bowen Byram and Owen Power, with more affordable contracts and fewer protections, are considered more realistic trade assets.With contract talks reportedly paused and unrestricted free agency on the horizon,reports that Alex Tuch's name has been quietly circulated in trade discussions. According to reports, Tuch is likely to be traded as a candidate. The 29-year-old right winger has recently paused his contract extension talks with the Sabres. His current cap hit is $4.75 million, and he also holds a modified no-trade clause, allowing him to block a trade to five specified teams.According to reports, the Boston Bruins and Edmonton Oilers have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring Buffalo Sabres forward Alex Tuch. Recently, in an appearance on the Daily Faceoff Rundown Inside Edition, Tuch’s agent, Brian Bartlett, announced that talks on his client's signing a contract extension with the Sabres have been paused.Owing to this situation, both the Bruins and Oilers are reportedly monitoring Tuch’s situation closely. The 28-year-old winger, known for his strong two-way play and physical presence, could bring valuable depth and versatility to either team’s top six.It is to be noted that Tuch is entering the final year of the seven-year, $33.2 million contract, with a $4.7 million annual cap hit. He originally signed with the Vegas Golden Knights, who selected him 18th overall in the 2014 NHL Draft.However, regarding the trade rumors, if results don’t improve soon, the team may need to reshape the roster and rebuild the team to get quality results for the benefit of the organization.","The buffalo sabres are once again facing tough roster decisions to end their 14-year playoff drought.

Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, york university.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale ai shut down an entire team of contractors in its dallas office this week.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie scott, the ex-wife of amazon co-founder jeff bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.","N nvidia's market share in china has dropped from 95% to zero, according to ceo jensen huang.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce ceo marc benioff is delivering contradictory messages about ai's role in the workplace.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The uk government has announced the introduction of digital ids aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Implant helps to restore reading for people with atrophic AMD

Collaboration and persistence reap reward

Chip implantation: Not an easy operation





Restoring vision — or at least improving it — for those with macular degeneration may soon be possible with a tiny chip and special glasses.Together, the chip and eyeglasses have been shown to restore central vision for a type of eye disease, known as Age-related macular degeneration (AMD).More than 80% of patients at trial sites across the United States, Germany, UK, Netherlands and Italy showed significant improvement in central vision following a year of monitoring.With the implant, the patients were able to read numbers and words at home and could improve their reading ability by 25 letters — or five lines — on a standard eye exam chart.The majority of participants, who were aged over 50 years, had their vision improved to about half as good as the standard 20/20 vision.""It's the first time ever where it has been shown that vision can be restored in a blind retinal area that is important for daily life,"" Frank Holz, the study's lead and the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Bonn, told DW.As some people age, the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, can deteriorate, leading first to vision blurring and then ongoing degeneration. Atrophic AMD is a leading cause of sight loss in older people, affecting at least five million people globally.A healthy eye can 'see' by receiving light from the outside world and converting it into electrical signals that are sent via the optic nerve into the brain for interpretation. Macular degeneration reduces the eye's ability to do this.The solution of implanting a pinhead-sized chip into the retina that can compensate for this deterioration inspired Daniel Palanker, an ophthalmologist at Stanford University, US. He collaborated with French eye expert Jose-Alain Sahel, based at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine, on developing the technology. They wanted to develop an implant that would do away with under-skin wires and appointed Holz to lead the latest trial.But the chip is only one half of what they call the ""PRIMA"" system.The other half is the specialized set of eyeglasses. They use a mounted camera to transmit visual data to the implant, which beams the data to a handheld processor for enhancement, and then receives higher-quality imagery back.The images are converted to electrical impulses and utilize the remaining retinal cells to send the information to the brain.""It requires, importantly in this disease, that the biocomputer, if you will — the [biological] wiring anterior to the chip — is still present,"" said Holz, referring to still-functioning cells in the eye.""If all cells from the retina were dead, the chip wouldn't work at all. It [the implant] just replaces the photoreceptors and basically translates light into electric stimuli, which is what nature does in the eye with the retina.""Sahel and Stanford-based Palanker had been working on separate technologies to try addressing the same problem when they met at a conference in 2012.They decided to pool their resources to develop the implant, first with small studies with several patients and then this larger trial with more than 30.But the current study nearly collapsed when the company developing PRIMA went out of business in 2024.""I remember vividly the days not so long ago, when everything was just about to die at the time when the study was almost complete,"" Sahel told DW. ""There might have been a situation where you have a product that is working and there is no way to get it to the people.""The developer has since been acquired by US company Science Corporation, which has taken over production and is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a medical therapy in the US, and CE certification for use in Europe.By conducting the trial across multiple countries and sites, the trial team is hopeful approval will be achieved in both regions.""You want to demonstrate that the technology is not just limited to one or two very skilled surgeons,"" Sahel told DW. ""And that also patients from multiple backgrounds can benefit from it.""It is an essential criterion for regulators that researchers show that difficult operations such as this implantation can be successfully performed by eye surgeons. While some adverse effects were reported in some patients, these cleared up by the end of the 12-month study period.""Demonstrating that across 13 different sites and different surgeons there was some consistency in the results gives the ability to apply to get that distributed to more centers and more patients,"" Sahel said.Sahel and Holz both highlighted that there are limitations to the new technology. While the operation to implant the chip had now been successfully performed by multiple surgeons around the world, they told DW it was not an easy operation.""It's a very complex surgery that needs good skills,"" Sahel said.The other challenge is the patient. There are logistical barriers that could affect patient suitability, such as their ability to repeatedly visit a clinic for post-surgery rehabilitation, and to have at-home support during this period.Holz said an implant recipient must be willing to have ongoing post-surgery review, and be trained to use the camera and processor to be able to successfully use the implant.That rehabilitation program currently takes around 12 months.","Pinhead-sized chip and special glasses have been shown to restore central vision for age-related macular degeneration.

Lithium-ion battery and power bank fire incidents trigger stricter airline regulations

List of items banned/prohibited by UAE carriers

Item / Category Cabin (Carry‑On) Checked Baggage Key Restrictions / Notes PEDs with built‑in lithium batteries (phones, laptops, tablets, cameras) Yes Yes (in many cases) Battery must be ≤ 100 Wh; max 15 devices per passenger (Etihad); must be fully switched off in checked baggage. Spare / loose lithium batteries Yes (cabin only) Not allowed Must be ≤ 100 Wh (or ≤ 160 Wh with airline approval); terminals must be protected. Power banks Yes (under 100 Wh only) Not allowed Only 1 per passenger (some airlines); must be labelled; usage banned onboard on some airlines (e.g., Emirates from Oct 1, 2025); must not be stored in overhead bins. Smart bags / motorised rideables (hoverboards, mini‑Segways, etc.) Often banned Not allowed Battery must be removable; if not, item is fully prohibited. Mobility aids with lithium batteries (wheelchairs, etc.) Allowed (with approval) Allowed (with approval) Battery ≤ 300 Wh (or 2 x 160 Wh); must be removable and protected. Airline approval required. Devices with integrated lithium batteries (in checked baggage) Sometimes allowed Yes (with conditions) Device must be off; lithium content restrictions apply (metal > 0.3 g or ion > 2.7 Wh may be restricted). Liquids, aerosols, flammable items Varies Varies Alcohol above 70% banned; compressed gases, flammables restricted; check airport/airline rules.

Key highlights and practical tips

The 100 Wh capacity threshold is a recurring standard for lithium‑ion batteries across these UAE airline/airport policies (carry‑on only for many battery types).

The rule that power banks may not be used onboard flights (on certain airlines) is relatively new (e.g., Emirates from 1 October 2025) and reflects a tighter safety stance.

Many items that use lithium batteries (spare batteries, power banks, rideables) are considered high fire risk — thus limitations apply for carry‑on vs checked.

Even if an item is technically allowed, poorly‑packaged or non‑compliant items may be confiscated at security/boarding. Emirates explicitly warns of this.

Always check both your airline’s policy and the airport/departure country’s regulated lists (e.g., Dubai Airports “Departures Prohibited Items”).

For flights to/from the U.S., additional rules apply (e.g., electronic devices must be charged and operated when requested).





The recent lithium battery fire aboard an Air China flight on October 18 has once again spotlighted the growing aviation safety concerns related to power banks and lithium-ion batteries. Flight CA139, traveling from Hangzhou to Incheon, South Korea, was forced to divert to Shanghai after a lithium battery either from a power bank or a device ignited in an overhead bin. Fortunately, no injuries were reported and the plane landed safely. This incident renews global concern about the risks posed by lithium batteries onboard aircraft, particularly when stored in overhead compartments where smoke detection can be delayed.Barely a day later, on October 19, an IndiGo flight in Delhi faced a similar scare when a passenger's power bank caught fire during taxiing. The crew contained the blaze swiftly with no injuries, underscoring the persistent risks of these devices in aviation. Airlines stressed the importance of strict guidelines for battery-operated devices following these events.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports lithium battery fires occur about once every 10 days globally, often involving power banks or spare batteries in overhead bins.Aviation experts caution that while a full global ban on power banks is not immediate, tightening watt-hour limits and usage rules is underway. If incidents persist, wide prohibitions could follow, but banning all lithium battery devices is impractical given their ubiquitous use in laptops, medical devices, and cameras.Following the incident, China has banned uncertified or recalled power banks on domestic flights from June 2025 onward, allowing only ""3C"" certified units. Several airlines, including Korean Air, Air China, and Qantas, have also issued advisories restricting power bank use onboard. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has called for improved crew training on lithium battery fires and better passenger communication about safe storage.Ahead of these incidents, UAE carriers like Emirates and flydubai had already introduced stringent controls effective October 1, 2025. Still, passenger confusion remains high; many incorrectly believe power banks can be checked in, despite global rules requiring them in cabin baggage with terminal protection. Travellers are urged to carry only certified power banks under 100 Wh in hand luggage, avoid using or charging them during flights, store them within easy reach (not in overhead bins), and report immediately if devices overheat, smoke, or spark.While the Air China fire could accelerate regulatory restrictions, the aviation industry balances safety with practicality, given passengers' dependence on battery-powered devices. Experts emphasize the shift from convenience towards caution will continue, with potential for stricter bans if major fire incidents reoccur. Until then, strict adherence to existing guidelines remains key to safe travel.","Aviation experts suggest recent flight fires could impact uae carriers to restrict power banks, devices with lithium-ion batteries on board.

Final thoughts on Saudi’s Green Card





Saudi Arabia’s Premium Residency Permit has introduced an affordable and attractive entry point with its SAR 4,000 fee category under five specialized residency tracks launched in January 2024. Designed to attract global talent, the Premium Residency allows expatriates to live, work, invest, and own property in Saudi Arabia without a local sponsor, providing freedom to innovate and invest while offering pathways to permanent residency.Launched in 2019 and expanded in 2024, the program now includes seven distinct tracks tailored to various profiles. Here is a detailed look at the five routes to the SAR 4,000 Premium Residency Permit:Applicants approved under these categories pay a one-time issuance fee of SAR 4,000 (around US $1065), instead of the older higher fees - SAR 100,000 per year for limited-duration residency or SAR 800,000 for unlimited/permanent residency. The reduced fee applies only to those who meet the specific conditions for each track, offering a cost-effective option tailored to professionals, creatives, investors, and property owners.These tracks cater to highly skilled individuals and wealth holders who can prove their specialized qualifications or investments, providing access to Saudi Arabia with a much lower financial barrier but higher eligibility standards.These privileges represent a substantial upgrade compared to typical work/residency permits (iqama), offering greater autonomy, security, and long-term integration possibilities.Meeting these conditions is mandatory to benefit from the SAR 4,000 issuance fee privilege.Failure to respond to queries within 60 days or non-compliance can lead to rejection.The Premium Residency under SAR 4,000 tracks can be cancelled for:Applicants and families have a grace period of up to 60 days (extensible to 180 days) to settle affairs after cancellation.Saudi Arabia’s SAR 4,000 Premium Residency products open a strategic gateway for expatriates and investors to enjoy significant residency privileges, provided they meet the specialized criteria tied to talent, investment, entrepreneurship, or property ownership.While the issuance fee is substantially more affordable compared to previous Premium Residency fees, applicants must satisfy specific financial eligibility conditions that vary by track, such as minimum salary requirements for special talents, minimum investment amounts for investors and entrepreneurs, or property value thresholds for real estate owners. These financial criteria ensure that only qualified individuals who contribute to the Kingdom’s long-term economic growth and socioeconomic development can benefit from this cost-effective, exclusive pathway.For those interested in applying or needing personalized advice, consulting with legal and immigration professionals specializing in Saudi residency programs is recommended.","Saudi's premium residency program includes five different routes costing sar 4,000.

“Was in India tonight with another big group firing small fire cracker back and forth at Each-other, seems stupid now I’m writing this,”

“But one of the group on the other side got hit by a cracker I shot and got a cut above their eye brow. I feel terrible.”





British content creator and Kick streamer Sam Pepper is again at the center of controversy, but this time during Diwali celebrations in India. The 36-year-old was reportedly involved in a fireworks incident that allegedly injured a young girl in New Delhi on October 20, 2025, sparking outrage online and leading to his suspension from the streaming platform.While celebrating the festival of lights in India, Pepper was seen live-streaming as locals launched fireworks across a neighborhood street. The British streamer decided to join the activity, lighting and firing his own fireworks toward another group celebrating nearby.In one widely circulated clip, Pepper appeared to aim a firework directly toward people across the road. The firework shot through the air and seemed to make contact with a group of locals. As the explosion went off, Pepper’s cameraman could be heard shouting excitedly while Pepper smiled at the camera.Following the viral clip, another Reddit user shared an update, claiming that a girl from the group hit by the firework was injured. In a follow-up video, a local approached Pepper and allegedly told him that one of her eyes has been injured.Pepper initially reacted with disbelief, saying,before adding that he thought they might be exaggerating. The local insisted it was serious, to which Pepper replied that he had only been “playing” and that it was an accident.The conversation sparked confusion online, with conflicting claims about the extent of the injury.

5 streamers who went too far live on camera,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/5-streamers-who-went-too-far-live-on-camera/articleshow/124708387.cms,"Live streaming's cutthroat competition has led some creators to extreme actions, resulting in permanent Twitch bans. From displaying fake weapons and faking disabilities to making threats and engaging in offensive content, these five streamers learned the hard way that shock value can cost them their platforms. Their stories highlight the strict policies and ethical boundaries on the platform.

In the ever-expanding world of live streaming, competition for attention can push creators to extremes. With thousands of content creators vying for views, subscriptions, and donations, some streamers take bold and sometimes reckless steps to stand out. While creativity is part of the game, not all stunts land well. In fact, some lead directly to permanent Twitch bans. Let’s explore five notorious cases where things spiraled far beyond poor judgment.RiceGum is no stranger to controversy, but his Twitch ban wasn’t about trash talk or trolling. While streaming, he casually pulled out a realistic-looking BB gun on camera. Twitch’s policy on violent threats and weapons is clear: “they’re all forbidden, no matter what.” Even though it wasn’t a real firearm, the visual alone was enough to warrant a permanent ban. It raises an important question: was the shock value really worth the consequences?ZilianOP (Angel Hamilton) delivered one of the most shocking betrayals in Twitch history. Known for streaming from a wheelchair, he had built a community that believed he was disabled, many donating in support. That illusion shattered when, during a stream he thought had ended, he stood up and walked away. The damage to viewer trust was irreversible, and Twitch swiftly banned him. While not illegal, it was deeply unethical and unforgettable.Streamer Cr0 combined excessive drinking, threats, and cheating into a dangerous cocktail of bad decisions.His chaotic streams escalated to the point where he “threatened to kill himself on Twitter,” hinting he would do it live. While mental health is serious, weaponizing it for shock or sympathy crossed a line. Twitch banned him permanently, arguably the right call for his safety and the community’s.Gross Gore blurred the line between personal drama and public meltdowns. After spending thousands to impress women who chose other gamers, he spiraled into rage, accusing others of “brainwashing” and even issuing direct threats. Twitch, unsurprisingly, said goodbye with no appeal.Brittany Venti fell victim to a 4Chan raid while streaming, where offensive messages were read aloud via text-to-speech. Despite not authoring the comments, she was banned again. With prior suspensions for “too much cleavage” and mocking viewers, Twitch’s patience had clearly worn thin.Also Read: Top 10 Richest streamers in the US (2025 Updated List)","Live streaming's cutthroat competition has led some creators to extreme actions, resulting in permanent twitch bans.
