'Canceled right after I completed biometrics today'





Visa applicants in India Tuesday received messages that their appointment at the consular office this week has been rescheduled . The rescheduled dates are mostly in March 2026 as the immigration office buys time for social media vetting of applicants -- the new rule that kicks in from December 15, 2025 where all social media accounts of applicants will be scrutinized to check if the individual made any negative posts about the US.Panic spread as the US Embassy in India also confirmed that appointment dates are being rescheduled. ""If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied admittance to the Consulate,"" the message said.Social media users said the clarification from the embassy was vague as applicants are left in a lurch, as they don't know what to do until March, and whether their companies in the US will allow them to remain in India till March.A Redditor said the appointment rescheduling will end the career as the US employer would not allow to work remotely. ""I am stuck in India, have biometrics this week. I used all my leaves to come for stamping. My employer cannot allow me to work remotely. This is the end of my career, worked so hard to get a job and build my life so far, everything is gone with one single decision. I dont know what to do since it is moved to May 2025, and I will certainly lose my job.This is the end of all my hardwork and dreams,"" the person wrote.One user said the visa appointment in Chennai consulated scheduled on December 18 got canceled right after their biometrics Tuesday. ""This is new uncharted territory for everyone. I think you and everyone else should reach out to your employer and their immigration firms, solicit their advice and come back to this group with the advice provided by the lawyers. Only after a good sample set of advice received from various employers and lawyers, will we able to make sense of what the next steps can be,"" one wrote. Some applicants said they came to India for that appointment and now they don't know what to do as they can't stay in India until their rescheduled date in 2026.",Visa applicants in india received messages that their appointment at the consular office this week has been rescheduled.

Isro to launch its heaviest US commercial sat BlueBird-6 on December 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-launch-its-heaviest-us-commercial-sat-bluebird-6-on-december-15/articleshow/125897729.cms,"ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

NEW DELHI: In a boost to Indo-US space cooperation, Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15. Isro’s ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM3 will put the US satellite into orbit.AST SpaceMobile, a Texas-based company that has built the space-based cellular broadband network, said, “BlueBird-6, a US licensed satellite, is scheduled to launch on Dec 15. It is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation satellites. When launched, it will feature the largest commercial phased array in low earth orbit at nearly 2,400 sqft. This represents 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports ten times the data capacity. ”BlueBird-6 is a “Block-2” satellite and part of a larger plan by AST SpaceMobile to deploy a series of satellites to achieve non-continuous service, with further launches scheduled through 2026. Its aim is to bridge the “digital divide” by offering fast, unhindered direct-to-device mobile broadband service in areas with poor or non-existent terrestrial network coverage.The BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver a high amount of bandwidth, with each unit capable of up to 10,000 MHz. They operate by partnering with existing mobile network carriers to enhance their networks using licensed spectrum.The BlueBird-6 satellite arrived in India from the US on Oct 19. It was later transported by road to Sriharikota for integration with launcher LVM3, fuelling and final checks ahead of its launch.The liftoff is being handled by New Space India Limited (NSIL), Isro’s commercial wing. LVM-3 had recently put India’s heaviest CMS-3 satellite, weighing 4.4 tonnes, into its orbit on Nov 2. A three-stage launch vehicle, LVM3 rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,000 kg to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The human-rated version of this vehicle will fly three Indian astronauts to space, as part of the Gaganyaan mission, which is planned for 2027.","Isro will launch its heaviest american commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne bluebird-6, from sriharikota spaceport on dec 15.

Sovereign control a valid concern: Satya Nadella,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sovereign-control-a-valid-concern-satya-nadella/articleshow/125897551.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced a significant $17.5 billion investment in India over four years, focusing on AI and cloud.

NEW DELHI; As Microsoft invests $17.5 billion in India over the next four years into AI and cloud, the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella Wednesday said it was a ""legitimate concern"" of countries like India to talk about sovereign control and local resilience.Asked whether AI and tech prowess were increasingly being used as diplomacy tools and nations needed to build resilience and sovereign stack, Nadella said, ""... it's absolutely a very legitimate question and concern... and I would say a requirement.

Caminiti’s Rising Momentum as Draft Boards Finalize

As the 2025 MLB Mock Draft conversation intensifies, a Chicago White Sox rumor has zeroed in on one name:, the talented left-handed pitcher from Saguaro High School in Arizona. With the White Sox holding the No. 2 overall pick, league insiders increasingly believe Caminiti has become the franchise’s preferred selection as draft momentum builds.Cam Caminiti’s stock continues to soar thanks to a fastball already touching the upper 90s, a sharp swing-and-miss slider, and a highly projectable frame that hints at even more velocity growth. Scouts regularly compare his early profile to past top-10 MLB arms, citing his poise, athleticism, and ability to overpower hitters. His slider frequently earns plus grades, and analysts expect his fastball metrics to climb as he adds strength.Chicago’s interest aligns perfectly with the organization’s longstanding blueprint of investing heavily in high-octane left-handers. From Chris Sale to Carlos Rodón to Garrett Crochet, the White Sox have a track record of doubling down on elite pitching traits. Caminiti fits that mold: frontline upside, premium strikeout potential, and significant developmental runway.With Chicago’s revamped, data-driven pitching infrastructure, evaluators believe the club is well-positioned to maximize Caminiti’s ceiling.While some MLB teams prefer the dependability of college pitchers, the White Sox appear committed to upside over polish in this draft cycle. Caminiti’s youth and trajectory give him one of the highest long-term ceilings in the entire class. His delivery, raw stuff, and makeup align with what Chicago now prioritizes under its mechanics-focused development model.There remains mild speculation about whether Caminiti could sneak into contention for the top overall pick, but most insiders expect the Colorado Rockies to target a position player, likely Konnor Griffin. If that holds, Chicago will effectively have the first choice among pitching prospects, placing Caminiti firmly in their sights as the favorite at No. 2.Selecting Caminiti would signal a definitive commitment to rebuilding through elite pitching talent. The White Sox have struggled in recent years to develop sustainable rotation depth, making a potential future ace extremely valuable. Adding a high-octane arm through the 2025 MLB Mock Draft could reshape the organization’s long-term pitching outlook.Also read: MLB mock draft: Colorado Rockies emerge as favorites for $6,216,600 Pittsburgh Pirates prep star as #1 pick As scouting departments lock in their evaluations, Caminiti’s connection to Chicago only strengthens.

Starlink’s India Launch Plans

Starlink's India entry

Elon Musk-led Starlink plans to soon introduce its satellite communication services in India with pricing between Rs 2,500-3,500 for retail customers. The company aims to provide services across multiple sectors including maritime, aviation, retail, and enterprise segments. Earlier, Starlink had briefly displayed pricing of Rs 8,600 monthly on its website, which was subsequently removed. The company later clarified this was due to a technical error.Industry experts considered the initially displayed price point high, suggesting it would have hindered Starlink's competitiveness in India's price-conscious market. Sources told ET that Starlink will announce official pricing after receiving complete regulatory clearances and spectrum allocation from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).The company has already secured the required Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence for retail satellite services. Additionally, it has obtained VSAT licence and permissions for flight and maritime connectivity. These authorisations enable Starlink to deliver satellite-based services across various sectors.Industry experts believe satellite communication will serve as a supplementary service rather than a disruptive force to traditional telecommunications, primarily due to substantial price differences in broadband services.As noted by JM Financial, whilst Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel offer basic fiber and fixed wireless services at Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 monthly (approximately $6 to $12), Starlink's services are expected to cost three to five times more than these conventional providers.The Indian government has not yet assigned spectrum to Starlink for commercial service deployment, and security clearances remain pending.The firm has recruited leadership personnel for its India operations, including a head executive and financial staff. The India operations and governmental relationships at both national and state levels will remain under the supervision of Lauren Dreyer, who serves as Starlink's vice president, according to informed sources.An industry expert suggests that Starlink's initial strategy for India focuses on establishing a presence rather than immediate profitability. ""When the constellation is densified in the coming time, their unit costs will be better. They are coming to India with a long term plan,"" the expert told ET.He emphasised that Starlink's satellite communication services would not directly rival telecommunications companies due to significant differences in service costs.","Elon musk-led starlink plans to soon introduce its satellite communication services in india.

Colorado’s Scouting Philosophy Points Toward Griffin

Other Contenders for the Top Pick

The 2025 MLB Mock Draft conversation has intensified as scouting departments finalize early big boards, and one name has separated himself from the rest:, the two-way prep standout widely regarded as the top all-around athlete in this year’s class. With theholding the No. 1 pick, industry insiders increasingly believe Griffin is the frontrunner to headline the draft.Konnor Griffin, a dynamic outfielder and shortstop from Jackson Prep in Mississippi, has long been considered the highest-upside player eligible in the 2025 MLB Mock Draft cycle. At 6-foot-4 with explosive athleticism, 70-grade speed, and a plus arm, Griffin possesses the type of rare tool set that scouts describe as “franchise-altering.” His power continues to develop, his defensive versatility is elite, and his makeup consistently draws high marks from evaluators.For the Colorado Rockies, the fit appears seamless. Colorado has frequently targeted premium athletes with advanced projection in recent drafts, and Konnor Griffin embodies that strategy more than any player in the class. His ability to play center field at a high level stands out, particularly in spacious Coors Field, where outfield range is a crucial team-building priority. Offensively, scouts rave about his bat speed and potential to grow into a 20-25 home run threat while maintaining top-tier defensive production.The Colorado Rockies’ scouting approach also aligns with this direction. Since embracing a long-term rebuild, Colorado has shifted focus toward acquiring dynamic athletes capable of impacting the game in multiple phases. Griffin not only checks those boxes but arguably presents the organization with its best opportunity in years to secure a future superstar.Still, the decision will be closely watched. While Konnor Griffin headlines most 2025 MLB Mock Draft boards, college arms such as Brody Brecht and high-upside prep lefties like Cam Caminiti are also under consideration. Yet the overwhelming expectation from insiders is that Griffin offers the safest blend of ceiling and floor, making him the ideal cornerstone for a franchise eager to redefine its competitive trajectory.Also read: MLB mock draft: Chicago White Sox strongly linked to $3.6 million ex-Atlanta Braves fireballing lefty at #2 As the draft approaches, the noise around Konnor Griffin to Colorado continues to grow louder.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A near-death experience that shaped Huang’s three decades of paranoia

Why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang 's fears suddenly look prophetic





Despite leading Nvidia to become the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation, CEO Jensen Huang admits he operates in constant anxiety, working every single day including holidays. His fears may be justified—this week alone, Nvidia lost $250 billion in market value after reports emerged that Meta is in advanced talks to buy billions worth of competing chips from Google , threatening the chipmaker's decade-long dominance in AI hardware.""The phrase '30 days from going out of business'—I've used for 33 years,"" Huang revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. ""The feeling doesn't change. The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""Huang's anxiety isn't unfounded paranoia—it's scar tissue from survival. In the mid-1990s, Nvidia discovered fatal flaws in its first graphics chip while developing technology for Sega's gaming console. With funds evaporating, Huang flew to Japan for an excruciating conversation: he told Sega's CEO the product wouldn't work and the deal must end, but simultaneously begged for the final $5 million payment to prevent bankruptcy.Remarkably, Sega converted it into an investment, giving Nvidia the lifeline that eventually built a trillion-dollar empire.That near-collapse experience now fuels Huang's relentless schedule. He wakes at 4 a.m. daily to read ""several thousand emails,"" works seven days a week without exception—""including Thanksgiving, Christmas""—and admits he's ""always in a state of anxiety."" His motivation? ""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed. Failure drives me more than greed.""Huang's paranoia might be wisdom. Nvidia made the rare move of issuing a public defense after The Information reported that Meta—planning up to $72 billion in AI spending this year—is negotiating massive purchases of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). The news triggered a 6% stock plunge, erasing roughly $250 billion in value, while Alphabet shares surged 4%.""Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model,"" the company declared on X, breaking its usual silence on competitors. But Google's latest Gemini 3 AI model, trained entirely on TPUs rather than Nvidia chips, is being hailed by industry leaders as potentially superior. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly announced he's switching from ChatGPT after three years, calling Gemini 3 the better product.The threat is existential to Nvidia's 90% market share in AI accelerators. If Google captures even a fraction of the hundreds of billions being spent on AI processors—particularly from customers like Meta—it would represent the first serious crack in Nvidia's dominance.Huang's work ethic has infected his family: both his children, Madison and Spencer, now in their thirties, work at Nvidia after joining as interns in 2020 and 2022. ""Now we have three people working every day,"" Huang said.For a CEO who never stopped running scared despite building a $4.5-trillion empire, the market turmoil caused by Google likely only confirmed what he's believed for 33 years: you're always 30 days from going out of business.","Jensen huang is the ceo of nvidia, the first company ever to hit a $5 trillion valuation.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Wall Street is sending a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences. The company’s Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns reportedly told team that the delay is “going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right. ”Facebook already sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The form factor of Meta's upcoming Glasses will reportedly be similar to that of Apple Vision Pro, with may be more power.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse. Analysts saw name change as the right move, as Instagram was -- and continues to be -- more valuable than Facebook. Along with WhatsApp and Messenger, the four apps are known as Meta's Family of Apps","Reality labs, meta's virtual reality unit, is likely to be cut by as much as 30%.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ' daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia. The new funding values the company at $180 million. However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture. Instead, the Bill Gates donated his time and experience to her daughter’s startup.

Kianni also took a break from her studies so that she could quickly learn everything about the industry they were going to work in, she told Vogue.Earlier, Phoebe Gates told Elle that when she first floated the idea to her parents, Bill and Melinda Gates, they urged her to treat it as a side project.

TCS Layoffs: Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar gives written reply in Vidhan Parishad on TCS layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maharashtra-labour-minister-aakash-fundkar-gives-written-reply-in-vidhan-parishad-on-tcs-layoffs/articleshow/125886840.cms,"TCS layoffs: Legislative concerns

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Around 376 employees of tata consultancy services (tcs) were laid off at the company’s pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year.

When does RaKai’s Twitch ban officially end?

Fellow streamer Ray received a warning from Twitch for attempting to feature RaKai. This comes after RaKai's suspension for alleged illegal activities. RaKai also faced backlash for insulting another streamer. He is currently offline and offline. His return date is set.

Ray reveals Twitch warning and explains why RaKai cannot appear on streams until the ban lifts





The uncertainty surrounding RaKai’s sudden Twitch suspension has finally started to settle after fellow streamer Ray, known online as “rayasianboy”, revealed the updated timeline for the ban. RaKai, one of the fastest-rising young faces on the platform at just 16 years old, was abruptly suspended on December 2, 2025.The reason, according to RaKai himself, was tied to “illegal activities,” though he did not elaborate. Confusion escalated when his dashboard initially showed a two-year ban. Twitch later stated this was simply a “visual bug,” leaving fans waiting for clarity. Now, Ray’s latest update has provided the clearest picture so far, confirming that RaKai will remain off Twitch until January 1, 2026.During a December 9 livestream, Ray told viewers that Twitch officially informed him that RaKai’s suspension ends on January 1, effectively ruling out any collaborations until then.He explained the situation bluntly: “Yeah, chat, RaKai got banned until January 1st. We cannot do st with RaKai until January 1st. He’s going to be grounded… he cannot pop out on stream… because I got an email from Twitch. Chat, I got an email from Twitch.Okay? It’s over, bro.”**Ray then pulled up the email he received from Twitch, showing that the platform had issued him a warning for “aiding account suspension evasion.” The message reminded him of Twitch’s policies and reinforced that even indirect attempts to feature a banned creator could trigger disciplinary action.Meanwhile, RaKai has been dealing with additional backlash. On the same day as Ray’s update, the young streamer posted a video of his mother scolding him for calling fellow streamer QTCinderella an “ugly bch” following her joke at The Streamer Awards 2025. In the clip, she reprimanded him, saying: “That is not how you talk to women… I raised you way better than that… your a is coming home.”The combination of disciplinary action, public criticism, and parental intervention has left RaKai sidelined both online and offline. As of now, he has not commented further on his upcoming return, though January 1, 2026, marks the next opportunity for him to reenter the Twitch community, with a spotlight brighter than ever.Also Read: “Do some horrible things to her”: Disturbing assault threats against streamer Fanfan reported at The Streamer Awards 2025","Twitch streamer rakai's ban will end on january 1, 2026.

Social media vetting of H-1B candidates will begin on December 15. Consular offices in Hyderabad and Chennai process hundreds of visa appointments every day.

Appointments of mid-December were canceled and rescheduled to March 2026, at the earliest.

Visa stamping is done in the home country, according to a new rule. So a number of H-1B candidates took their appointments in India and flew home, coinciding with the holiday season in the US.

Days before their scheduled appointments, they got to know that those dates have been deferred to March, April, May etc.

Many H-1B visa holders won't be able to enter the US without the stamping. So they have no other option than to remain stuck in India waiting for their appointment date in 2026.

H-1B candidates, according to lawyers, can be allowed to work from India but that also depends on their employers. And many are scared that they will lose their jobs.

Lawyers have advised that those who are in the US and thinking of taking an appointment for visa stamping should not leave the country as the situation is volatile, and leaving the country now means they would not be able to be back for at least six months.

A Reddit post went viral as the Redditor urged Indians in the US who have their appointments in India in January, February to cancel those appointments so that some dates free up and those who are stuck in India can possibly get an early chance.

Many H-1B candidates in the US responded to the post saying that this could become the only solution to the visa mess now in India and many said they already canceled their dates in December, January and February.
