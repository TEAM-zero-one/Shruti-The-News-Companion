NEW DELHI: The Miracle of Mind app , a free meditation platform by renowned spiritual leader Sadhguru, has surpassed 1 million downloads within a mere 15 hours of its launch. This rapid uptake has taken the social media world by storm, outpacing even the initial adoption of ChatGPT.Within just 24 hours, Miracle of Mind was trending in over 20 countries, including major regions such as India, the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Germany, Kenya, and the UAE. This remarkable global response underscores the growing recognition of meditation as an essential tool for mental wellness.The app, available in English, Hindi, Tamil, Russian, and Spanish, offers a 7-minute guided meditation that has quickly become a viral sensation. Users across the world have embraced the app’s simplicity and effectiveness, with many praising its ease of use and immediate impact on their well-being.In addition to its meditation feature, Miracle of Mind includes an AI-powered function that delivers personalized wisdom and insights drawn from Sadhguru’s extensive archive. The app covers a broad range of topics, further enhancing its appeal to users seeking guidance in various aspects of life.Sadhguru himself took to social media to address the app’s launch, sharing a powerful message about the importance of mental health. He noted, “It is expected that by 2050, about 30-33% of the world’s population would be mentally ill. This is because we always think that solutions to our challenges are outside of us. All the solutions are within us, but we have no 'Inward access.' The Miracle of Mind app will teach you how to build this access. Every one of you must invest 7 minutes every day to make this happen for yourselves and for everyone around you. Let’s make it happen. – Sg.”The app’s success arrived at a crucial moment, as mental health issues continue to rise globally. In India alone, it’s estimated that between 60 to 70 million people suffer from common to severe mental disorders. The country also holds the unfortunate distinction of having the highest number of suicides worldwide. A report from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed that in 2022, 171,000 people died by suicide in India, marking the highest suicide rate ever recorded in the country—12.4 per 100,000 people.As the global demand for mental wellness solutions rises, the Miracle of Mind app stands as a timely and innovative response, offering people a tool to cultivate inner peace and emotional balance in an increasingly stressed world.","The miracle of mind app has surpassed 1 million downloads within a mere 15 hours of its launch.

Pokemon GO Tour Unova 2025 (Global) starts in less than 24 hours and you might want to know how to get ato make the most out of this event. Kyurem is one of the most sought-after Pokemon, especially when it knows the move Glaciate.In this article, we will walk you through everything you need to know to get Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GO.To catch Kyurem with Glaciate, you need to participate in specific events. The GO Tour: Unova Event is a significant opportunity for trainers. Trainers may come across Kyurem after fighting Black and White Kyurem in five-star raids in cities like New Taipei City and Los Angeles, where this event has previously occurred. The Charged Attack Glaciate will be familiar to every Kyurem captured during this period.For trainers outside these cities or those without tickets, there’s still hope! The GO Tour Unova: Global event begins on March 1, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. local time. This global event features the ""It's Not Over Yet"" Special Research story that allows players to choose between paths associated with Reshiram (Black Version) or Zekrom (White Version).When engaging with the ""It's Not Over Yet"" Special Research, you’ll need to make a crucial decision:- Black Version ( Reshiram ): If you choose this path, all Kyurem encountered after defeating Black Kyurem in five-star raids will know Glaciate.- White Version (Zekrom): Opting for this path means that all Kyurem caught after defeating White Kyurem will have Glaciate as well.This choice is essential for trainers aiming to maximize their chances of obtaining a Kyurem with this unique move.If you miss your chance during these events, fear not! You can also teach Kyurem Glaciate using an Elite Charged TM. This provides flexibility for trainers who may have caught a regular variant but want to enhance its moveset and get a Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GOKyurem gains significant importance when it knows the move Glaciate. This move not only enhances Kyurem's battle capabilities but also unlocks unique fusion possibilities with Reshiram and Zekrom. Here's why obtaining a Kyurem with Glaciate in Pokemon GO is highly desirable for trainers:One of the primary reasons to acquire a Kyurem with Glaciate is to enable fusions with Reshiram and Zekrom. When a Kyurem that knows Glaciate is fused with Zekrom, it transforms into Black Kyurem, while fusion with Reshiram results in White Kyurem . These fusions are critical because Black Kyurem can use Freeze Shock, and White Kyurem can utilize Ice Burn, moves that also have Adventure Effects. Moreover, breaking the fusion in these creatures returns them to their original forms, with Kyurem still retaining Glaciate, allowing trainers to repeat the fusion process.Glaciate significantly boosts Kyurem's performance in PvP battles, particularly in the Master League. Since December 2022, the addition of Glaciate to Kyurem's move-pool has allowed it to make a mark in the Master League meta. It has a reliable means of damaging counters such as Zacian, Xerneas, and Togekiss, and can be a general nuisance with its Attack debuffs. Glaciate's ability to debuff the opponent's attack by one stage makes it competitive. While Kyurem might not always secure a win, it can leave opponents debuffed, providing an advantage for teammates.Also read: White Kyurem vs Black Kyurem in Pokemon GO: Which form is stronger and why? In PvE scenarios, Glaciate is a powerful Ice-type charged move. Although Kyurem lacks an Ice-type fast move, Glaciate provides it with a damage output comparable to top-tier Dragon-type Pokemon when facing bosses weak to both Dragon and Ice attacks. Kyurem with Dragon Breath and Glaciate can be a viable raid attacker, especially against Dragon-type Pokemon vulnerable to both move types. However, it's worth noting that Kyurem functions as an honorary Dragon attacker rather than a top-tier Ice attacker in many situations.","Kyurem gains significant importance when it knows the move glaciate. This move not only enhances kyurem's battle capabilities but also unlocks unique fusion possibilities with reshiram and zekrom. The go tour unova: global event begins on march 1, 2025.

Remember Mayhem Monday in January 2025, when the biggest AI success story $595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes. The almost $600 billion wipeout in Nvidia's wealth happened on the day frenzy over DeepSeek sent shockwaves in US and European stock markets. Other than Nvidia, other technology stocks including Google, Apple and Microsoft too lost billions. The launch and popularity of low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek rattled the technology industry. However, no company was as badly hit as Nvidia.Now it seems that the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly said that the market hugely over reacted. For, Nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the same period last year, and net income rising 80% to $22.1 billion. The company's data center revenue nearly doubled, contributing significantly to these results.At the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ""extraordinary"" demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips, which generated $11 billion in revenue this quarter. Despite concerns last month over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's advancements, Huang emphasized that reasoning models like DeepSeek's R1 require substantially more computing power, potentially up to 100 times more, underscoring the continued demand for Nvidia's high-performance chips.Looking ahead, Nvidia projects first-quarter revenue of approximately $43 billion, indicating sustained growth in the AI chip market. “We will grow strongly in 2025,” CEO Huang asserted at the earnings call.Over the last two years, Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street. While Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.","N nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion.

“He can't take it anymore”: Tom Brady reportedly fed up with Gisele Bündchen and seeks emotional and physical distance for a fresh start,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-cant-take-it-anymore-tom-brady-reportedly-fed-up-with-gisele-bndchen-and-seeks-emotional-and-physical-distance-for-a-fresh-start/articleshow/118657321.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen

Tom Brady is making a big transition in his life as he gets set to sell his $150 million Miami estate, a home where he previously lived with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. Sources indicate that the sale comes from the emotional pain of watching Bündchen progress with her new life and her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn baby. While Brady has kept his eye on his post-NFL business, the fact that his ex-wife is moving on to a new chapter has reportedly not been easy for him.Sources indicate that 47-year-old ex-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance between himself and the lingering reminders of his past. While he continues with his work and self-development, the harsh fact of remaining unmarried for close to three years with his former spouse, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, having reestablished life with her lover, Joaquim Valente, has purportedly been challenging. Unloading his $150 million Miami villa seems a part of wrapping that chapter up and opening doors to a new life.Brady and Bündchen, who share their two children, divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2022. Although they remain on good terms for the benefit of their family, the fact that their homes are in close proximity has not allowed Brady to completely move on.The supermodel and her new beau, a jiu-jitsu instructor, now share a lavish waterfront home just across from Brady's compound—a home that was originally part of the ex-couple's future together. Far from representing their aspirations, however, it now serves as a bitter reminder of what he stands to lose.For Brady, the sale of the mansion can be more than a money matter, but a heart matter as well. Leaving a city full of reminders of his own marriage may grant him the time he requires to work on being happy himself and potentially even opening himself to finding another relationship.Though he still hasn't commented publicly on his motivation for selling, those in his inner circle say the switch is about something greater than a piece of property—it's about reclaiming his sense of mind and looking to the future stage of his life.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told radaronline.com. ""He sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down. He can't take it anymore. He wants to sell the house. It reminds him of Gisele. She was the one who dominated the remodeling, and it's her style, her personal touches. He still feels her nuance everywhere.”Also Read: “I’m pretty disappointed”: Rob Gronkowski feels overlooked as Tom Brady makes Raiders moves without considering him Tom Brady has no plans to leave Miami, the city he moved to in 2019 when he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he is looking to downsize and find a more private residence that allows him to step away from the memories tied to his current home.Despite wanting a fresh start, Brady remains dedicated to co-parenting his two children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. His goal is to create a peaceful and comfortable environment where he can focus on his personal well-being while staying actively involved in his children's lives.","Tom brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from gisele bündchen.

Is Tesla feeling heat of anti-Elon backlash?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-tesla-feeling-heat-of-anti-elon-backlash/articleshow/118655863.cms,"Tesla

Tesla followed up its worst sales month in years in France with another weak showing in Feb, prolonging its early-year slump in one of Europe's biggest markets for electric vehicles. Its sales across Europe fell 45%, in stark contrast with the 37% jump in overall EV registrations.Tesla registered 2,395 cars last month in France, down 26% from a year ago. Tesla's decline compares with a 0.7% drop in total industry sales. Tesla is off to a slow start to the year in part due to the changeover of its most popular vehicle, the Model Y, to a new design. It requires a weeks-long pause in output to update production lines, which likely is costing the company sales.Investors are concerned that Tesla is bearing the brunt of retaliation against Musk, who's increasingly asserting himself in global politics as one of Trump's top advisers. Consumers have protested the Tesla CEO at dozens of Tesla stores and several showrooms have been vandalised in recent weeks. Registrations plunged 63% to 1,141 cars in Jan, its lowest total in France since Aug 2022, and also declined in key markets including the UK and Germany.","Tesla registered 2,395 cars last month in france, down 26% from a year ago.

Building a brand, one store at a time

Surviving the gymwear wars

From a grandmother’s sewing machine to a billion-dollar empire

At just 28, Ben Francis became Britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, Gymshark , skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation. Now, at 32, he’s setting his sights on an even bigger conquest—New York City.Later this year, Francis will open a sprawling 13,000-square-foot Gymshark store on Bond Street, a move he sees as crucial to the brand’s global success, reported the New York Post.“I love New York … It’s the perfect place for Gymshark, and I’m honored to call it our North American home,” he told me. “We have to be successful in the US in order for us to be successful around the world.”Francis built Gymshark online in 2012, capitalizing on the rise of fitness influencers and the e-commerce boom. But now, he believes physical stores are just as important as a brand’s digital presence.His first retail venture came in 2022 with a flagship store on London’s Regent Street. Dubai followed, and in late 2024, a Gymshark pop-up landed on Wooster Street in SoHo. That temporary store’s success gave Francis the confidence to commit to a permanent NYC presence.“The city has been so supportive of our brand vision,” he said. “People can finally see and feel the product we’re so proud of … I think physical brick-and-mortar stores are actually sort of a new and different way for us to reach people.”Unlike traditional athletic apparel stores, Gymshark’s locations are designed as community hubs , featuring workout spaces, personal training sessions, and room for fitness events.The $25 billion gymwear market is fiercely competitive. While brands like Outdoor Voices and Olympia Sports have folded, giants like Nike and Lululemon battle newer players like Alo Yoga and Vuori for dominance. Gymshark, however, has carved out a loyal following with its sleek, performance-driven designs and strong influencer network.Francis credits Gymshark’s staying power to its community—one he built from scratch by sending free products to fitness YouTubers long before influencer marketing was mainstream.“When I was getting into the gym, all the people I learned the most from were online on YouTube,” he said. “When Gymshark started, we ended up sending product to a few of my heroes at the time.”Some of those influencers even received equity in the company, aligning their success with Gymshark’s meteoric rise.Francis, who grew up in England’s West Midlands, wasn’t an overnight success. He dabbled in multiple business ventures as a teen, many of which flopped. But when he started Gymshark, he had a clear vision: create gym clothes that were breathable, sweat-wicking, and odor-resistant.He learned to sew from his grandmother and stitched early orders himself. The brand’s rapid success was fueled by both its quality and Francis’ transparency—he let customers see behind the scenes of the business, building trust and loyalty.“People nowadays are interested in the story behind a brand,” he said. “They want to know who’s behind the scenes, who’s running it, and what the story is.”Now, as he brings Gymshark to the heart of New York, Francis is betting big on a future where fitness isn’t just about working out—it’s about belonging.","At just 28, ben francis became britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, gymshark, skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation.

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries—a cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement. The label serves as a reminder to use the ""Lock Out/Control Lock"" function, which disables the heating elements when the range is not in use. LG has also provided an instructional video demonstrating how to activate this safety feature.","Health canada has issued a warning over certain lg free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs.

Already facing decades-long green card backlogs , Indian professionals now grapple with added uncertainty and financial instability due to the proposed measures.An Indian man recently shared the ""real reason"" for leaving the United States and returning to India after ten years of stay, following social media speculation he had lost his job or faced visa issues.Aniruddha Anjana , co-founder & chief executive officer of ArcAligned, established his business in the US while working a regular job. Last year, he relocated to India accompanied by his spouse and offspring.Aniruddha shared on social media that his decision to return to India was not due to visa issues, layoffs, or concerns about immigrant uncertainty under Trump’s administration, but instead, he moved back to be closer to his elderly parents.In a post on his Instagram account, Aniruddha Anjana shared a video and wrote: ""When I last posted about returning to India after living in the US for over 10 years because my parents needed me, I received many comments assuming that I must have lost my job or faced visa issues. But the real reason was that I wanted to spend time with my parents—who sacrificed so much for me, knowing they would never ask me to return.""""This was the only reason I came back, and after a year, I can confidently say it was the best decision of my life.

<p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries plans<br></p>

HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the giant South Korean shipbuilding company, has initiated plans to establish a shipyard in India, conducting site visits this month to explore potential locations.The delegation from the company, which holds approximately 10% of the global market share in shipbuilding, visited Thoothukudi and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. They also held discussions with L&T executives regarding possible collaboration. L&T operates a substantial shipyard in Kattupalli that handles shipbuilding, retrofitting and conversions.The company's interest extends beyond Tamil Nadu to other coastal states.""HD Hyundai Heavy Industries came down to India earlier this month to assess possible sites for a shipbuilding facility,"" a source familiar with the matter told ET. ""They have a shipyard in South Korea and are now very keen to build one in India to cater to the local demand.""""The competition between states is very intense now,"" revealed another source. ""It is not just in talks with Tamil Nadu but also Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, who are also courting the company aggressively.""In December 2023, an Indian delegation, headed by ports and shipping ministry secretary T.K. Ramachandran, visited major South Korean shipyards to explore collaborative opportunities for enhancing India's shipbuilding sector.The delegation conducted meetings in Seoul with representatives from Korea's leading three shipbuilding companies, including HD Hyundai.Also Read | Move away from Russia?

India is set to construct the world's longest hyperloop test facility, which will help evaluate the feasibility of commercial operations for this advanced transport system. The infrastructure, capable of achieving speeds up to 1,100 kilometres per hour, follows the successful completion of a 422-metre test track in December 2024, according to officials.""Plans are being readied for a 40–50-kilometre (km) hyperloop test track in the country. It will be supported by the Indian Railways ,"" a senior official told ET.Hyperloop represents an emerging high-speed mass transit system. Whilst operating similarly to railways, it utilises advanced technologies aimed at delivering greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Various technological approaches are being explored globally to create a transportation system featuring capsules supported by air-bearing surfaces within low-pressure tubes.The 422-metre vacuum tube testing facility was established through a collaborative effort between Indian Railways, L&T Constructions and Avishkar Hyperloop at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.TuTr Hyperloop, a deep-tech venture incubated at IIT Madras, conducted India's first commercial intent hyperloop pod run on Monday. The firm has been working alongside Indian Railways to advance this technology. Additionally, an official statement indicated that Indian Railways and IIT Madras will collaborate on developing a vertical take-off landing vehicle, with funding from Indian Railways.The potential for hyperloop technology in India is substantial. As Denis Tudor, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-founder at Swisspod Technologies said, ""India has a great potential for hyperloop. It is estimated that a 40-kilometre test track would cost $150 -300 million upon completion depending on the dimension for the project.""A significant collaboration emerged when Tudor's Swiss-American enterprise and TuTr from India entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in March 2022. Both Swiss and Indian governments supported this partnership. Notably, Swisspod receives backing from Elon Musk, who serves as Senior Advisor to US President Donald Trump.The initial concept of the Hyperloop System originated from Swiss Professor Marcel Juffer during the 1970s. Subsequently, Swissmetro SA was established in 1992 to advance this innovation, though the company ceased operations in 2009.In Nevada, Virgin Hyperloop continues its system testing programme. The company has now prioritised freight transport applications, considering the complexities in passenger certification. Simultaneously, Canadian firm TransPod is developing a test facility to verify their distinctive propulsion and levitation mechanism. Additionally, China is advancing plans for a system similar to Hyperloop, intended to achieve hypersonic velocities.","The infrastructure, capable of achieving speeds up to 1,100 kilometres per hour, follows the successful completion of a 422-metre test track in december 2024.
