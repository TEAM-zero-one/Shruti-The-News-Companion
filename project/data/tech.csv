TCS responds: ‘Case of Unauthorized Absence’





NEW DELHI: A viral photo of a Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) employee sleeping on a footpath outside the company’s Pune office has sparked widespread outrage on social media, prompting the IT giant to issue an official clarification.As per a social media post shared by the Forum of IT Employees (TITE), the employee, identified as Sourabh More, claimed he was forced to live on the street after TCS withheld his salary, despite his repeated pleas to the HR department. In a handwritten letter placed beside him on the pavement, More wrote:""I have informed HR I don’t have money and will be forced to sleep and live outside TCS on the footpath.""According to a summary shared by FITE on 'X', More reported back to TCS’s Sahyadri Park campus in Pune on July 29, 2025, but found his employee ID inactive and his salary unpaid. Despite informing HR during a meeting on July 30, the issue allegedly remained unresolved.The image of More sleeping outside the tech park quickly went viral.With the post, the FITE also issued a solidarity message, stating:“His courage to raise his voice in such dire conditions is commendable. While protest is a powerful message, we also urge such cases to be reported to the Labour Office for formal redress.”In response to the viral incident and media coverage, TCS issued an official statement, asserting that the issue stemmed from unauthorized absence and was handled as per internal protocols:“This is a case of unauthorised absence where the employee has been absent from office. In accordance with standard procedure, payroll was suspended during this period. The employee has now reported back and requested reinstatement. We have provided him accommodation for now and are supporting him in addressing his situation in a fair and constructive manner.”The company emphasised that after More’s return, he was offered support and temporary lodging, and efforts are underway to resolve the situation appropriately.","A viral photo of a tata consultancy services (tcs) employee sleeping on a footpath outside the company’s pune office has sparked widespread outrage on social media.

Tesla’s defense: distracted driving

Implications for Tesla’s Autopilot safety record



Broader consequences for Tesla’s legal exposure





A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash involving a Model S sedan equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance technology. The case, centered around allegations that Tesla’s Autopilot system failed to prevent the fatal collision, marks one of the largest verdicts ever against the electric vehicle giant. While Tesla argued that driver behavior caused the accident, the jury found the company partly liable for the death, amplifying concerns about the safety of Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving technology.In April 2019, George McGee was driving a 2019 Tesla Model S near Key Largo, Florida, with Autopilot engaged. McGee dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it, diverting attention from the road. The vehicle failed to detect a parked Chevrolet Tahoe at an intersection, and McGee did not brake or steer away. The Tesla struck a couple standing nearby—22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon, who died, and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, who suffered severe injuries.The plaintiff’s attorneys contended that Tesla’s Autopilot was defective, focusing on its inability to detect stationary vehicles at intersections and its design limitations for controlled-access highways only.Tesla’s promotion of Autopilot as highly capable, without adequate warnings about these limits, was a critical issue.Tesla maintained that the crash was primarily the result of driver distraction and error. McGee admitted to looking for his dropped phone moments before the collision and was traveling at approximately 62 mph in a 45 mph zone. Tesla emphasized that no vehicle could have avoided the accident under those conditions and stated that their cars meet all required safety standards.This verdict arrives amidst growing scrutiny of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technologies. Critics argue the ruling highlights real safety risks associated with Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, especially outside limited highway conditions. The company’s liability in this high-profile case may lead to heightened regulatory attention and encourage further litigation related to its driver assistance technology.The $243 million verdict includes $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages, with Tesla found 33% responsible for the incident. The driver was found 67% liable but is not financially responsible as he was not a defendant. Legal experts see this verdict as a pivotal precedent regarding automaker accountability for semi-autonomous driving system failures. Tesla has announced plans to appeal the decision.","A florida jury has ordered tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash involving a model s sedan equipped with tesla’s autopilot driver-assistance technology.

Comet as an AI operating system for work



Reactions from the broader tech industry



Comet’s current availability and pricing



A shift in the nature of work



In a recent podcast appearance, Perplexity AI CEO Aravind Srinivas outlined a bold new direction for white-collar automation with the launch of Comet, an AI-powered browser that may soon carry out the work of recruiters and administrative assistants with a single prompt. The new browser, still in invite-only beta, is designed to integrate with everyday platforms like Gmail, LinkedIn, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. Srinivas demonstrated how Comet is capable of managing complex workflows, from identifying and contacting potential job candidates to handling follow-ups, organising meetings, and resolving scheduling conflicts.The project reflects a broader shift in how artificial intelligence is beginning to take over roles that were once thought to require a high degree of human input. By running background tasks continuously and following natural language instructions, Comet could make it possible for businesses to automate essential office functions that were previously the domain of skilled professionals. Srinivas described this development not as a far-off possibility but as something that is already happening in part—and which could be fully operational in less than a year.Recruiting is one of the most process-heavy areas of modern business. It involves screening profiles, gathering contact information, reaching out to candidates, tracking communication, and scheduling interviews. Traditionally, this work takes days of effort by recruiters and coordinators. Comet aims to condense that into a single prompt. According to Srinivas, a recruiter’s entire week of work could be replicated through automation that identifies ideal candidate profiles, drafts personalised messages, and manages all the follow-up without manual oversight.For instance, Srinivas explained how Comet could search for a specific group of professionals—such as Stanford alumni who previously worked at Anthropic—compile their LinkedIn information into Google Sheets, and automatically write tailored outreach emails. As the responses come in, Comet can log the status of each lead, schedule calls using Google Calendar, and even resolve conflicting time slots. The goal is not just to save time, but to redesign the workflow entirely.In addition to recruitment, Comet has been built to perform tasks typically handled by executive assistants. These include managing inboxes, preparing documents for meetings, sending reminders, coordinating with multiple calendars, and staying on top of logistics. According to Srinivas, the browser is designed to operate in the background while staying contextually aware of what the user needs.He described how Comet can follow up on conversations automatically, sync calendars to avoid scheduling errors, and maintain updated status logs across apps. This isn’t basic automation like email templates or keyboard shortcuts. Instead, it involves AI following ongoing tasks, reasoning across apps, and completing multi-step processes with little or no manual input.Srinivas also shared his long-term vision for Comet as more than just a browser. He sees it becoming a kind of operating system for white-collar productivity—something that runs quietly in the background, ready to handle user commands in plain language. This AI would not just assist, but take initiative in coordinating, tracking, and executing tasks across platforms.To emphasise the potential value of this approach, Srinivas gave the example of a company paying thousands of dollars for a single AI prompt, if the output helps generate real business results. Comet, in his view, represents the next evolution in digital tools, where the browser becomes a command centre for intelligent, end-to-end automation.The announcement and capabilities of Comet have reignited discussions about AI's role in future employment. Other tech leaders have expressed similar concerns and predictions. Dario Amodei, CEO of AI firm Anthropic, has estimated that half of all entry-level white-collar jobs could disappear within five years due to automation.Ford CEO Jim Farley has also publicly stated that artificial intelligence may replace 50 percent of white-collar workers. However, not all industry voices agree on the scale or impact.Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Jensen Huang of Nvidia maintain that AI will serve as a tool for human enhancement, not outright replacement. In that context, Comet may be seen either as a threat to jobs or as a way to boost productivity without increasing headcount. What is clear is that the introduction of tools like Comet is already changing how work gets done.At present, Comet is being rolled out as an invite-only beta available to premium subscribers of Perplexity. The premium tier, which includes access to Perplexity’s advanced features, is priced at around $200 per month. Srinivas mentioned that future pricing may be structured around value-based billing. In practical terms, that means businesses may be charged based on the value they gain from the AI’s output rather than just usage hours or prompt limits.Although the browser is still in development, Srinivas suggested that its core functions—especially those related to recruiter and assistant roles—will become fully automated within the next six to twelve months. This timeline suggests that companies and workers may need to prepare sooner than expected for significant changes in workflow and job design.Comet represents more than just a new app or productivity tool. It shows how artificial intelligence can be integrated into something as familiar as a browser to perform meaningful work tasks across multiple platforms. Unlike past generations of AI that required specific APIs or single-purpose tools, Comet functions like a worker that can read your email, understand your calendar, communicate through your apps, and make real-time decisions.Srinivas emphasised that the people who embrace tools like Comet are likely to remain relevant in the job market. Those who avoid or delay using AI may find themselves falling behind. This isn’t simply about learning how to use software. It’s about rethinking the role of humans in an AI-assisted professional landscape.","Perplexity ceo aravind srinivas warns: ai can now wipe out two white-collar roles with just 'one prompt'ai tool comet could replace a recruiter's week of work with ‘one prompt’taking over administrative assistant functions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis explains ai in healthcare can replace doctors but not nurses.

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a hotspot for celebrity summer getaways.Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks reflected the relaxed yet luxurious atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant private yachts.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez.

Apple retail growth accelerates globally with strong focus on India and the Middle East

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.",Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across india.

""Euphoria"" star Sydney Sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.A short video of 27-year-old actress Sydney Sweeney showing off her handgun skills has gone viral, with social media users impressed by her sharp aim and quick shooting.In the clip, Sydney can be seen dressed casually with earmuffs on. She is seen confidently loading and firing a Glock.Her steady stance and tight shot groupings had many online saying she looked like a pro, not a first-timer. Netizens reacted quickly as the video of Sydney Sweeney at a shooting range circulated online.One user reposted the video and wrote, ""Sydney Sweeney has insane handgun skills.""While another user reposted saying, ""She doesn’t just have great jeans; she's also a total pro at the firing range, unloading 17 rounds in just 9 seconds,"" referring to her recent American Eagle campaign.The video’s buzz comes in the midst of online backlash over Sweeney’s American Eagle ad, which has been criticised for its messaging and portrayal.The ad, which features Sweeney in a classic Americana setting fixing a car and wearing denim. Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.","""euphoria"" star sydney sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Positive buzz for Anderson

No reaction from Meghan





Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan.

"Expats face new job bans in Oman: Systems analysts, engineers, and managers now restricted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/expats-face-new-job-bans-in-oman-systems-analysts-engineers-and-managers-now-restricted/articleshow/123115787.cms,"Oman has expanded its list of professions prohibited for non-Omani workers/Representative Image

TL;DR:

Oman has expanded its list of professions prohibited for non-Omani workers, now including engineers, IT roles, quality control, and several technical and supervisory positions.

The restrictions take effect immediately for many jobs and will be phased in for others between January 2025 and January 2027.

These changes are part of Oman’s broader Omani sation policy to prioritize employment for Omani nationals across key sectors.

Detailed list and implementation timeline:

Immediately restricted professions (effective the day after publication):

Managerial, technical, and supervisory roles including hotel reception managers, lifeguards, travel agents, room service supervisors, quality control managers, marketing specialists, labour supervisors, loading/unloading supervisors, and more.

Technical and operational roles such as drilling fluid engineers, drilling officers, electricians and mechanical technicians (general maintenance), drilling measurement engineers, quality controllers, aircraft loading controllers, ship lashing/fixing workers, and flatbed crane/forklift drivers.

Sales and logistics positions like new/used vehicle salesperson, new/used parts seller, commercial brokers, and commercial promoters (sales representatives).

IT and administrative jobs like computer maintenance technicians, computer operators, marine observers, and ship traffic controllers.

From January 1, 2026:



Computer Programmer, Computer Engineer, Computer Operator.

From January 1, 2027:



Website Designer, Operations Analyst.



Purpose and policy context:



Omanisation Policy: This expansion is part of Oman’s long-term Omanisation initiative, first launched in 1988, which aims to replace foreign workers with trained Omani nationals in both the public and private sectors, and to reduce unemployment among citizens.

The move aligns with the country’s national workforce development plans, responding to the needs for local expertise and allowing Omanis to fill roles in industries previously dominated by expatriates.





Key points:

The new bans affect a total of more than 30 professions, spanning transport, hospitality, quality control, technical roles, IT, and sales

The phased implementation allows businesses and non-Omani employees time to plan for transition or localization in these sectors.

Existing permits can run until their expiry; however, no new permits or renewals for the affected professions will be granted to expatriate workers once each restriction takes effect.

Employers must carefully review their expatriate workforce and plan ahead, as failure to comply will lead to non-renewal of work permits in banned professions. The resolution is legally binding and has been published in Oman’s Official Gazette.

Additional previous bans, covering construction workers, cleaners, drivers, and other semi- and unskilled occupations, remain in effect as part of Oman’s robust workforce nationalisation framework.





In September 2024, Oman’s Ministry of Labour announced an expanded list of professions closed to expatriate workers, reinforcing its commitment to Omanisation. This new resolution updates Ministerial Resolution No. 235/2022, expanding the list of professions restricted to Omani nationals. It is designed to boost opportunities for Omani citizens, particularly in high-skill, technical, and managerial occupations.Oman’s latest update to its prohibited professions list underlines the government’s ongoing drive to nationalize its workforce and ensure that Omanis benefit from opportunities in high-value, technical, and emerging sectors. The expansion affects a broad range of jobs across industries, with strict timelines and regulatory compliance required for all employers operating in the Sultanate.",Oman has expanded its list of professions prohibited for non-omani workers.
