Semiconductor push: India hosts 20% of world’s chip design engineers; consumption set to cross $120 billion by 2030,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/semiconductor-push-india-hosts-20-of-worlds-chip-design-engineers-consumption-set-to-cross-120-billion-by-2030/articleshow/123646878.cms,"AI image

Semiconductor Factories Rising in India, First Chip Ready by End of Year: PM Modi





India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, placing it as a key player in the global semiconductor design ecosystem, according to a report by Bastion Research.According to news agency ANI, the report underlined India’s strong position in the global semiconductor chain, noting, “India is already an important piece in the global semiconductor design. You may be surprised to know that approximately 20 per cent of the world's chip design engineers are based here.”Global technology leaders, including Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, and MediaTek have set up large R&D and design centres across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida. This strong presence has enabled India to emerge as one of the world’s leading hubs for chip design, as per ANI.Explaining the division of work worldwide, the report said engineers in the United States define the high-level chip architecture, such as deciding the type of chip, its end use, features, and launch strategy.Indian engineering teams, by contrast, take on the critical execution work — translating architecture into logic, simulating and testing chips, optimising performance, writing drivers and firmware, and fine-tuning electronic design automation tools.The report stressed this was not a “boss versus worker” setup but rather complementary roles between US and Indian teams.The Bastion Research findings also noted India’s policy push to strengthen its semiconductor ecosystem. The government launched the Semicon India Programme in 2021 with incentives worth around Rs 76,000 crore to attract global manufacturers.India’s semiconductor consumption is projected to rise sharply. “We consume about $24 billion worth semiconductors and it is expected to rise to upwards of $100-120 billion by 2030. When India starts to produce those chips, our share will definitely rise,” Sandeep Kumar, CEO of L&T Semiconductor Technologies and chairman of the Semiconductor Product Leadership Forum, was quoted as saying by ANI.The Forum, launched by the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), aims to build an ecosystem for product design, IP creation, and high-value innovation. It is targeting the launch of around 100 new companies by 2035, expected to absorb nearly five lakh workers, including a large number of engineers.Meanwhile, India recently rolled out its first domestically produced chip at CG Semi’s Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who inaugurated the facility last week, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “soon” dedicate the country’s first chip produced there.The government has so far approved 10 semiconductor manufacturing projects worth over Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states. Work is also underway on Semicon 2.0, the next phase of India’s semiconductor mission.","India accounts for around 20 per cent of the world’s chip design engineers, according to a report by bastion research.

"India clears Rs 1,500 crore subsidy for critical mineral recycling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-clears-rs-1500-crore-subsidy-for-critical-mineral-recycling/articleshow/123682525.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday approved a Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme for developing capacity for recycling critical minerals from electronic waste and other scrap such as used lithium-ion batteries and end-of-life vehicles etc. scrap with the aim of creating domestic supply chain resilience.The scheme is expected to ensure supply of vital elements, which have applications in sectors ranging from energy transition, communications, defence to space, till such time a critical mineral value chain based on exploration, auction and starting of mines as well as acquisition of foreign assets starts feeding the industry.According to a government statement, the incentives are expected to lead to development of at least 270 kilo tonne of annual recycling capacity resulting in around 40 kilo tonne annual critical mineral production, bringing in about Rs.8,000 crore of investment and creating close to 70,000 direct and indirect jobs.The incentives will consist of 20% subsidy on capital expenditure (capex) incurred on plant and machinery, equipment as well as associated utilities for starting production within specified timeframe, beyond which subsidy will be reduced.Subsidy on operational expenditure (opex) will be given in the form of incentive on incremental sales over the base year (2025-26). This will be split into two segments — 40% of eligible opex subsidy in the 2nd year and balance 60% in the 5th year from 2026-27 to FY 2030-31 on achievement of specified threshold of incremental sales.To ensure greater number of beneficiaries, total incentive (capex plus opex subsidy) for each entity will be subject to an overall ceiling of Rs.50 crore for large entities and Rs 25 crore for small entities. Within this ceiling, opex subsidy will be capped at Rs 10 crore for large and Rs 5 crore for small entities.The scheme will have a tenure of six years from 2025-26 to 2030-31 financial years. Eligible feedstock is e-waste, Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) scrap, and scrap other than e-waste & LIB scrap e.g. catalytic convertors in end-of-life vehicles.Investments in new units as well as expansion of capacity or modernisation and diversification of existing units will be eligible for getting subsidy under the scheme. Expected beneficiaries will be both large, established recyclers as well as small, new recyclers (including start-ups).","The scheme is expected to ensure supply of vital elements.

Why did Mark Cuban defend Steve Ballmer in the Kawhi Leonard scandal?



LA Clippers break silence as NBA opens an investigation



The Los Angeles Clippers are once again under the league’s microscope after a bombshell report linked star forward Kawhi Leonard and owner Steve Ballmer to a $28 million endorsement deal allegedly designed to dodge the NBA’s salary cap. While the team has denied any wrongdoing, one prominent voice in the basketball world has stepped forward in Ballmer’s defense. Former Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has recently taken Ballmer’s side and he explained the reason why.The controversy erupted when journalist Pablo Torre unveiled documents and testimony suggesting Leonard’s company, KL2 Aspire LLC, struck a $28 million agreement with Aspiration, a now-bankrupt tree-planting firm financially backed by Ballmer. Torre’s reporting alleged that Leonard barely had to lift a finger under the contract, which included clauses allowing him to decline promotional activity while still getting paid — provided he remained with the Clippers. One former employee of Aspiration described the arrangement bluntly, “to circumvent the salary cap.”For many fans, the setup appeared too convenient. The optics of Leonard being paid millions by a company linked to Ballmer sparked immediate speculation about a backdoor deal.But Mark Cuban wasn’t convinced. Writing on X, he explained where he stood.“I’m on Team Ballmer. As much as I wish they circumvented the salary cap, First Steve isn’t that dumb. If he did try to feed KL money, knowing what was at stake for him personally, and his team, do you think he would let the company go bankrupt? Knowing all creditors would be visible to the world? They got scammed by Aspiration, along with many others. Crimes for which they pleaded guilty last week.”Cuban argued that the more plausible explanation was fraud, not conspiracy. He highlighted the fact that Aspiration had also inked a massive $300 million sponsorship deal with the Clippers in 2021, making it logical for the company to tie Leonard to their brand. “Scammers do scammy things,” he wrote. “It actually makes perfect sense that if they stole money from investors and want the Clippers to succeed, why not give stolen money to help keep their best player?”The Clippers, for their part, have flatly denied Torre’s allegations. In a statement, the organization said: “Neither Mr. Ballmer nor the Clippers circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to Aspiration. Any contrary assertion is provably false.”The team stressed that Ballmer, like other investors, was duped by Aspiration’s fraudulent practices and only became aware of its misconduct once government investigations began.Also Read: Los Angeles Clippers finally issued statement after circumvention of NBA salary cap controversy involving Kawhi Leonard Meanwhile, the NBA has confirmed it is “commencing an investigation” into the matter. Punishments for proven violations could be severe, including heavy fines, lost draft picks, or even voided contracts.

Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce isn’t just a headline-grabbing celebrity moment, it’s also a massive win for Ralph Lauren. Within just 48 hours of the announcement, the brand reportedly earned $6.8 million in media value, thanks to the couple’s coordinated Ralph Lauren outfits in their engagement photos. From sold-out dresses to viral social media posts, this engagement proves just how powerful celebrity influence can be for fashion brands.The engagement photos, shared on Instagram on August 26, 2025, showed Swift in a $398 Polo Ralph Lauren striped silk-blend dress, while Kelce rocked a $138 cable-knit polo-collar sweater.

The dress sold out in all sizes almost immediately, showing how a single celebrity moment can create instant demand for fashion items.Earned media value is a way brands measure how much exposure they get from media coverage and social sharing, rather than paid ads.

Ralph Lauren’s visibility skyrocketed, proving that aligning with high-profile celebrities can pay off in a big way.The Swift-Kelce engagement is a textbook example of how modern celebrity moments can double as major marketing wins.

xQc Suggests a “Side Character” for Speed’s Streams



Backlash Over Alleged Bias

The Community Divided

With the incendiary remarks on the YouTube content and its CEO, Darren “IShowSpeed” Watkins Jr, xQc has managed to instigate online banter once again. On the 2nd of September 2025, a segment of his stream was shared that started rather extreme reactions on both sides of the feud.In light of the ongoing Speed Does America marathon, xQc decided to throw his opinion in. The French-Canadian streamer suggested that Speed’s content would have additional layers if such dynamics were added. “Alright, chat, listen; I think this might sound off the wall, but it would be great comedic relief if Speed had a side character for the stream. Maybe his cameraman, Slipz, starts fake production and becomes more of a character. I think it will help out a lot.” While a number of fans took this from its face value and saw it as an attempt to offer advice, an equal number of people were quick to jump to its defense and felt like xQc was trying to say that Speed couldn’t hold his streams by himself.As the video circulated on social media, it sparked controversy and further accusations that xQc has a habit of criticizing Black content creators. One user’s comment, which stated, ""Dude literally just hates on every black streamer"" gained immediate traction.Later the same day, yet another clip caused a stir. This time, xQc was noted for speaking about Speed’s cross-platform live viewer count. He remarked on how Speed is known for pulling huge numbers on YouTube, especially given that he and other streamers don’t have the algorithmic advantages or search tools that others use:“Speed gets 50k on YouTube with zero discoverability. Zero bots. Zero synthetic push. These are numbers that are, like, as raw as you can get them. And everyone knows Speed. Everyone knows him, like, everywhere.”Online feedback has been rather polarized. To one side, Speed’s supporters blamed xQc for having envious issues, attacking a streamer who has established himself outside of the Twitch ecosystem. On the other side, there were defenders for xQc, proposing that his remarks were less social media trolling and more stating the facts, and that he has a reputation for critiquing content creation methods no matter who the person is.Alongside IShowSpeed, xQc is also one of the most renowned live streamers, each having their own unique audience from their different platforms. This recent conflict shows just how childish and ego-driven the world of streaming is, as fan groups immediately jump to the defense of their preferred creators.Whether or not there was any truth in xQc’s “side character” theory, the reaction pinpoints one thing with undeniable clarity, discussions about Speed transcend the content he produces, they touch on matters of balanced online culture, shifting online entertainment, and the elements of identity and success therein.","Xqc suggested that speed should have a ""side character"" for his stream.

Kawhi Leonard's ""no-show job"" Deal



Pablo Torre talked to a former Aspiration employee to verify his discovery

Kawhi Leonard Signed a Secret $28M Deal. Steve Ballmer Funded a Fraud. We Followed the Money. | PTFO

Kawhi Leonard joined the Los Angeles Clippers right after winning the NBA Championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019. And he has been with the team since then, even though there have been a lot of injuries over the past 5 years. Now, a new report has been made public, which shows that he signed an endorsement deal with a fraudulent tree-planting company, which was apparently funded by Clippers owner Steve Ballmer.According to Pablo Torre of the podcast show Pablo Torre Finds Out, in March 2025, a multi-billion-dollar company called Aspiration, endorsed by many celebrities, filed for bankruptcy. It was later discovered to be an allegedly fraudulent tree-planting company, and in the list of creditors named during the bankruptcy filing, an LLC caught the eyes of a select few. Aspiration owes $7 million to a company called KL2 Aspire LLC, and Kawhi Leonard was the name in the manager/member name section of the company.So allegedly, Leonard signed a $28M “no-show job” endorsement deal with the fraudulent company, a company that was also allegedly funded by $50 million from Clippers owner Steve Ballmer. According to sources, it was done “to circumvent the salary cap,” and KL did not have to do any endorsement or show up anywhere for Aspiration.Pablo Torre, after getting his hands on this, did not stop there and went as far as to contact former Aspiration employees. He got a few responses, and one of them told Torre that Kawhi Leonard basically signed a ghost deal. Many are speculating that this was probably the reason for him to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers back in 2019.Former front-office executives Amin Elhassan and David Samson were also present during the show. The Clippers have since made a statement on the episode's content, saying: ""Neither Mr. Ballmer nor the Clippers circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to Aspiration. Any contrary assertion is provably false."" The company Aspiration is currently being probed by the U.S. government, so we may get to learn more about this soon.Also Read: Who is Brittany Renner?

Streameast shutdown follows arrests in Egypt; illegal NFL streams no longer available



Investigation reveals scale of operations

Protecting NFL revenue and broadcast integrity



The world’s largest illegal sports streaming platform, Streameast, was shut down following a coordinated operation between Egyptian authorities and the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The site, which offered unauthorized streams of major sports including NFL games, attracted 1.6 billion visits in the past year. Two men were arrested in El-Sheikh Zaid, Egypt, during the August 24 raid, and authorities uncovered a shell company believed to have laundered $6.2 million in advertising revenue generated by the platform.For years, Streameast allowed fans to stream NFL games without paying for official broadcasts, undermining revenue for leagues, teams, and broadcasters. Analysts estimate that illegal streaming platforms like Streameast siphon millions in potential advertising revenue and reduce viewership on official channels such as NFL+, Peacock, ESPN, and regional networks.While fans often rely on these platforms for free access, the shutdown underscores that piracy carries legal and financial risks, and also threatens the integrity of NFL broadcasting agreements.Investigators seized laptops, smartphones, cash, and credit cards during the raid.They also discovered the shell company used to launder millions in ad revenue, and $200,000 in cryptocurrency tied to Streameast operations. These funds were allegedly used to purchase real estate in Egypt. Streameast operated over 80 domains at its peak, providing streams for NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and European football leagues.This scale demonstrates just how widespread and lucrative illegal sports streaming has become, posing a serious challenge for the NFL and other major leagues.The Streameast takedown sends a clear message to other illegal sports streaming operators: the NFL and its partners are actively protecting their content. By relying on official platforms, fans help protect the financial ecosystem of professional sports and ensure that leagues can continue to provide high-quality broadcasts for years to come.With Streameast offline, fans seeking NFL games will need to rely on official streaming options to watch games legally and securely.

Letterman shot back, “Does radio ring a bell?” prompting laughter from the audience. Bill Gates clarified that users could listen to games anytime, to which Letterman replied, “Do tape recorders ring a bell?”Along with this, Bill Gates also talked about internet’s ability to connect people with niche interests also offer continuous updated information.

2 new health features coming with AirPods Pro 3

Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Apple AirPods Pro 3 are expected to launch next week. The Cupertino-based company will host its ‘Awe Dropping’ event on September 9 where it will unveil the 2025 iPhone lineup. The upcoming iPhone models include iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and the rumoured iPhone 17 Air. Along with the new iPhone 17 series models, Apple is also rumoured to announce a third-generation AirPods Pro model. The rumour mill has been churning leaks around the upcoming AirPods Pro 3. Here’s what to expectAn unnamed source (as reported by 9to5Mac) has said that the new AirPods Pro 3 may come with two new health features. These may include heart rate sensor and temperature sensor. Heart rate sensing had been rumored for a while, and with its debut on the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, the feature’s arrival became more likely on the AirPods Pro 3.Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman previously reported that Apple may be developing a Live translation feature for the latest generation of AirPods Pro. However, the leakster claims that live translation “as rumored earlier is not ready, and will likely be added in a later software update.”Apart from the health features, the AiPods Pro 3 are also said to come with improved sound quality and enhanced active noise cancellation.

Apple deal survives, investors cheer



Other restrictions on Google



What’s next for Google



In a landmark antitrust ruling, the US District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google can retain its Android operating system and Chrome browser . Along with this, the ruling also stated that the company can also keep the lucrative deal with Apple. But, Google will now have to share search data with its rivals in order to open up competition in the online search market. As reported by Reuters, this decision is followed by a five-year legal battle in which regulators accused Google of maintaining illegal monopoly in search and related advertising. While the court stopped short of ordering a breakup of Google’s core products. But the data sharing mandate is seen as a significant step toward levelling the playing field for competitors, including emerging AI-powered search tools.As per the Reuters report, Judge Mehta also noted that artificial intelligence companies such as OpenAI and developing advanced chatbots and AI search engines, are “better placed to compete with Google than any search engine developer has been in decades”. By giving them access to Google Search data could help in accelerating innovation and reducing the company dominance in the sector.Along with Android operating system and Google Chrome, the court has also allowed Google to continue paying Apple — reportedly around $20 billion annually in order to remain the default search engine on its devices. After this judgement, the shares of Alphabet rose by 7.2% and Apple also gained 3% in extended trading.As per the Reuters report, the judgement has barred Google from entering exclusive contracts which prevent the device makers and carriers from preloading rival search apps. Recent agreements with Samsung, Motorola, AT&T, and Verizon already reflect this shift, allowing more flexibility for competitors.Google has expressed its concerns over sharing search data as it could impact the privacy of its users. The company is reviewing the decision, with plans to appeal — a process that could take years and potentially reach the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling is part of a broader bipartisan crackdown on Big Tech, with ongoing cases against Meta, Amazon, and Apple.","Us district judge amit mehta has ruled that google can retain its android operating system and chrome browser.

Frontier Airlines has launched its annual GoWild! unlimited travel pass for a limited-time price of $299, giving travellers unparalleled flexibility across its network. The offer, valid from 2 to 5 September 2025, allows passengers to book unlimited domestic and international flights, subject to certain restrictions, for just one penny plus applicable taxes and fees. Those who purchase during this window also receive a complimentary GoWild! 2025–26 annual pass, which is valid immediately. The 2026–27 pass activates after the current period ends and is integrated directly into the buyer’s FRONTIER Miles account within seven business days, providing a smooth and convenient experience.The 2026–2027 GoWild! pass is valid for 20 months, marking the longest travel period since Frontier launched the programme in 2022. Previously, passes were valid only for trips beginning in May, but the extended timeframe now allows travellers to plan more freely. Passholders can book domestic flights one day before departure and international flights 10 days in advance, with earlier booking available for an extra fee. Reservations must be made via the flyfrontier.com portal or the Frontier mobile app, and the pass is non-transferable.While the GoWild! pass offers unlimited flights, certain blackout dates apply during high-demand periods across 2025, 2026, and 2027.Passholders should also note that flights do not include extras such as seat selection, checked baggage, or other add-ons, which must be purchased separately. Awareness of these conditions is crucial to fully benefit from the pass.Experts believe Frontier’s promotion could help it capture market share amid competitors’ challenges. Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is facing its second bankruptcy in under a year, while Southwest Airlines has faced customer backlash for ending its free checked-bag policy. Scott Keyes, founder of the flight deals site Going.com, said, “Frontier sees opportunity in the market for travellers seeking budget airline flights and has historically been good at expanding its offerings. ”The GoWild! pass provides a significant value proposition for frequent flyers, offering convenience, flexibility, and substantial cost savings.

Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year. The move comes under Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy, a key campaign promise passed by Congress in July.According to a draft list of eligible jobs, reported by Axios, the policy covers workers who earn tips “customarily and regularly.” This includes online video creators, podcasters, social media influencers, and streamers. It also applies to food service staff, musicians, dancers, and hospitality workers.The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 of tip income, with the benefit phasing out for individuals earning more than $150,000 or couples earning above $300,000 annually. Top-earning creators on platforms like Twitch and TikTok will not qualify, but mid-level influencers and small streamers are expected to benefit.On digital platforms, tips are often called by different names—Twitch “bits,” TikTok “gifts,” YouTube “Super Chats,” and OnlyFans “tip menus.” For creators who rely on this income, the deduction could ease tax pressure.The policy takes effect immediately, meaning qualifying workers can claim deductions for tips received in 2024 when they file their returns early next year. However, the scheme is temporary and set to expire after 2028 unless extended by Congress.The Republican senate of the US unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill in May. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision received unanimous bipartisan acceptance.","Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year.

A new customs exemption policy allows Bahraini factories to import key industrial inputs duty-free under specific conditions, marking a strategic shift to boost manufacturing, lower costs, and enhance local competitiveness.Bahrain has issued Decision No. (63) of 2025, a regulatory move that allows factories to import certain raw materials and production inputs without paying customs duties, provided specific conditions are met. The policy, which took effect ahead of September 2, 2025, aims to reduce input costs for manufacturers and strengthen domestic industrial resilience.According to the new rules, four main criteria will determine eligibility for duty exemptions:These conditions are designed to give manufacturers greater flexibility in sourcing materials and ensure that their supply chains remain uninterrupted and competitive, especially in high-value or time-sensitive production scenarios.His Excellency Abdulla bin Adel Fakhro, Bahrain’s Minister of Industry and Commerce, described the decision as a ""strategic step to boost national industries and develop local content.""He noted that the manufacturing sector remains a central pillar of Bahrain’s economy, and this policy is intended to provide tangible support for its expansion. The move is also a part of broader efforts to replace imports with high-quality local alternatives, enhance self-sufficiency, and contribute to sustainable industrial development.“This initiative will help replace imports with high-quality national products, increase self-sufficiency, and strengthen the industrial sector’s role in sustainable development,” the minister stated.Mr. Fakhro emphasized that the customs exemptions are directly aligned with two key national frameworks:He added that these exemptions are expected to increase production efficiency, attract investment, and help position Bahrain as a regional and international industrial hub.The new exemption rules are not only expected to reduce costs but also have wider economic benefits.
