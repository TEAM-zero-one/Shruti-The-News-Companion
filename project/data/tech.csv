In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","Linkedin is laying off 281 employees across california, a report claims. The microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in mountain view, 60 in san francisco, 23 in sunnyvale, 11 in carpinteria.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121508458,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-13122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
The judge's data dilemma in the Google search case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-judges-data-dilemma-in-the-google-search-case/articleshow/121544315.cms,"Liz Reid, of Google, speaks about new search AI capabilities in Mountain View, Calif, on May 20, 2025.





Data played a starring role in the government's successful antitrust suit against Google accusing it of illegally protecting its monopoly in online search. Now, steps to force Google to unlock its data trove could figure prominently in a ruling on how to address the tech giant's dominance, antitrust experts say.On Friday, the federal judge overseeing the case, Amit P Mehta, heard closing arguments in federal court in Washington on what corrective measures, known as remedies, he should order to restore competition. The government's requests include forcing Google to share its search engine results and advertising data with rivals.Justice Department lawyers have repeatedly described data as ""the oxygen"" for search engines. And in his ruling against Google in August, Mehta recounted in detail how the company harvests vast amounts of data from user searches and web crawling, then stores and analyzes the data to rule the lucrative market for internet search.Google, he noted, collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined. And as more data is fed into Google's software, the results that the search engine returns on everything from biology to bluejeans become more accurate and relevant to the person seeking information.Better search performance, in turn, attracts more users and more advertisers, Mehta wrote. It's a flywheel that steadily enhances Google's search and acts as a barrier to competition.""At every stage in the search process,"" the judge wrote, ""user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.""His decision on how to fix Google's monopoly has the potential to reshape competition on the internet, particularly as a new age of generative artificial intelligence takes off and is expected to overhaul the way people search for information online. Tech companies are racing to win consumers over with chatbots and other tools that can answer more sophisticated questions, drawing from vast pools of data.Mehta has already indicated that AI may factor into his deliberations, noting during a recent hearing the rapid development of the technology since the lawsuit went to trial in the fall of 2023.To fix Google's search monopoly, the Justice Department and the group of states that brought the case have recommended a range of sanctions, from simply prohibiting anticompetitive deals with companies that Google pays to make it the automatic search engine to forcing the company to sell off its market-leading Chrome browser.The government's data-related proposal falls somewhere in between. It includes requiring Google to share user search information and license its search index, a database of hundreds of billions of webpages scored by popularity, quality and relevance.In late April, Mehta said he looked at his job as weighing actions across a ""remedy spectrum."" At one end was a breakup order, he said, while at the minimalist end was a ban on illegal deals with browser and smartphone companies.In the middle were ""forward-looking remedies,"" he said, without elaborating on his thinking.Given the evidence in the case, a data-sharing order would be ""a conceptually appropriate remedy,"" since the exclusive deals increased Google's data advantage, said Douglas Melamed, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division and now a visiting fellow at the Stanford Law School.Still, a data-sharing project raises its own set of questions. In court testimony, Google emphasized the privacy concerns of passing user search data along to other companies.The government's data proposal also calls for access to software that uses data as an ingredient but was built by Google's engineers.""It looks like an administrative headache -- how much data, how often, and access to Google's crown jewel?"" said John Yun, an economist at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.Google has described the government's data-sharing plan as the equivalent of a breakup -- a forced surrender of its intellectual property, allowing competitors to reverse-engineer its technology.""The proposal on data sharing is so far-reaching, so extraordinary,"" that it ""feels like de facto divestiture of search,"" Sundar Pichai , CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company, testified in court last month.The history of forced asset sharing as a solution for monopolistic behavior is mixed. In 1956, as part of an antitrust settlement with the government, AT&T agreed to license its patents, including for transistors, the tiny switches that are the building blocks of electronic circuitry. That opened the door to an independent semiconductor industry in what became Silicon Valley.But the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was intended to increase competition for local telephone service by mandating that companies share network capacity, didn't result in much innovation.Eventually, genuine competition emerged, but it came from mobile wireless and cable broadband companies, said Jon Nuechterlein, a telecom expert and former general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission. Landline voice service has fallen from nearly 100% of households in 1996 to about 25% today.""Outside competition emerged independent of all the regulatory churn,"" said Nuechterlein, a distinguished scholar at George Washington University's Competition Law Center.Today, AI is the big unknown in search. Chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, the AI-powered search engine Perplexity, and others are potential Google disrupters. Google itself is investing heavily in AI-enhanced search, which Pichai recently described as ""a total reimagining of search.""While Mehta has more recently acknowledged the rapid advance of AI, his ruling in August noted that the technology had yet to overtake traditional search.""AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search,"" he wrote. ""Importantly, generative AI has not (or, at least, not yet) eliminated or materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results.""Some antitrust experts say Mehta's decision could affect search and AI.""The explosion of AI makes it even more important to have strong data-sharing remedies,"" said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ""AI and search overlap, and both ride on data.""","Google collects nine times as much user search data every day as all its rivals combined.

"Not drugs or gold, Chinese officials uncover cuddly Labubu toy smuggling",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/not-drugs-or-gold-chinese-officials-uncover-cuddly-labubu-toy-smuggling/articleshow/121537674.cms,"



Chinese customs officers recently made an unusual discovery, finding dozens of Pop Mart’s popular Labubu toys hidden in suitcases and being smuggled for resale.Far from drugs or weapons, these quirky and popular toys are now part of a growing illegal resale market. The plush characters, created by Hong Kong illustrator Kasing Lung, have become a hot trend not just in China but across the globe, thanks in part to celebrity endorsements from Rihanna, Dua Lipa, and Blackpink’s Lisa. Some were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week.The toys’ scarcity is fuelling desperation among fans. During a recent visit by CNN to a Pop Mart store in a busy Beijing mall, not a single Labubu was found on sale — only display models remained under lock and key.“They’re sold out in seconds,” said Evelyn Lin, a long-time fan. “It’s almost impossible to get a Labubu via the official channels.”That scarcity has pushed many into the arms of smugglers and resellers. According to a CNN tally of official notices, Chinese customs authorities have confiscated 462 Pop Mart toys since April. In one post, China’s customs administration confirmed the toys were intended “for profit by resale” and were seized in accordance with the law.However, it did not confirm if any legal charges had been filed against the individuals involved.Labubus, known for their bunny-shaped bodies and mischievous elf-like faces, with sharp pointy teeth, now retail for extremely high prices on second-hand platforms. One blind box from the latest Labubu 3.0 collection, initially priced at 584 yuan (£64), is reportedly reselling for between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan (£110–£220), according to Chinese state media.Pop Mart itself is thriving, as the company’s latest financials show global gross profit more than doubled last year, and its revenue in mainland China surged to over $1.09 billion, a 34% increase from the year before.But with skyrocketing demand comes risk. Beijing resident Kate Yang, an avid collector, says she’s been duped twice after purchasing what turned out to be fake Labubus online.“Because they are not available on official platforms, if you’re in a rush to get a gift for a friend, you just can’t manage to get the popular ones in time,” Yang explained. “You can only pay extra to buy from resale platforms.”As Pop Mart’s most famous creature continues to charm fans around the world, the lengths people are willing to go to get their hands on one may be the most surreal chapter yet in Labubu’s wild rise.","Pop mart’s labubu toys are now part of a growing illegal resale market.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi , his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals from participating in securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years. This action follows their involvement in deceptive YouTube videos that encouraged share purchases of Sadhna Broadcast.The regulatory body has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti, alongside a one-year securities market prohibition, according to Sebi's directive issued on Thursday.Additionally, the regulator has imposed financial penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on 57 other parties, including the promoters of Sadhna Broadcast (presently known as Crystal Business System Ltd).The regulatory body has instructed all 59 entities to return collective illegal profits of Rs 58.01 crore, with an additional 12 per cent annual interest, to be paid jointly until the complete settlement from the investigation conclusion.According to Sebi's findings, Arshad accumulated profits of Rs 41.70 lakh, whilst his wife gained Rs 50.35 lakh from these activities.The conclusive order identified Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta and Manish Mishra as the primary orchestrators of this scheme.The order also revealed that Subhash Aggarwal, a director of SBL's RTA, served as an intermediary between Manish Mishra and the promoters.These people were the key figures who orchestrated and implemented the deceptive plan, according to Sebi.Additionally, Sebi noted that Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah allowed their controlled accounts to be utilised for the fraudulent strategies of Manish Mishra and SBL's promoters.As a dealer at Choice and owner of the stockbroker's Delhi franchise respectively, they played crucial roles in enabling extensive manipulation of the scrip.Jatin Shah was instrumental in implementing the scheme, whilst other parties either supported the fraudulent activities or participated for quick profits, as stated in the order.According to the 109-page directive, Sebi indicated that the noticees acted as information intermediaries or helped execute manipulative trades, without trading the scrip through their personal accounts.Sebi explained that the organised scheme was carried out in two coordinated stages. Initially, connected and promoter-associated entities conducted trades amongst themselves to gradually increase the scrip price and create artificial market activity.The small-volume transactions had an outsized effect on pricing, primarily due to limited market liquidity. This enabled the involved parties to elevate the share value whilst deploying minimal trading resources.Subsequently, promotional content was broadcast via various YouTube platforms including 'Moneywise', 'The Advisor', and 'Profit Yatra', which were under Manish Mishra's management, as stated in the directive.These video presentations portrayed SBL as an attractive investment prospect and were strategically released to complement and enhance the orchestrated market activities.","Sebi has imposed monetary penalties of rs 5 lakh each on warsi and goretti.

EPFO likely to allow instant PF withdrawals via UPI and ATMs from June 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-likely-to-allow-instant-pf-withdrawals-via-upi-and-atms-from-june-2025/articleshow/121519755.cms,"Instant PF withdrawals under EPFO 3.0

Expanded withdrawal purposes

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is set to revolutionize the way millions of employees access their provident fund (PF) savings. Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs, according to DD News.This major step is being implemented with the support of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and has already received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.Currently, PF withdrawals involve submitting online claims followed by a waiting period for approval from EPFO field offices. This process can take several days or even weeks. However, the upcoming integration with UPI and ATMs is expected to make settlements instantaneous. Members will be allowed to withdraw up to ₹1 lakh instantly—especially helpful in emergencies.“EPFO has made significant improvements in its digital infrastructure by integrating over 120 databases,” said Sumita Dawra, Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“These efforts have reduced claim processing time to just three days, with 95 per cent of claims now being processed automatically. Further upgrades are also in progress to make the system even more efficient.”Currently, the EPF scheme allows withdrawals for medical emergencies, housing, education, and marriage, but members must meet specific eligibility criteria and provide proper documentation. With the upcoming changes, the scope of permitted withdrawal reasons will be expanded, giving employees greater financial flexibility for key life events.In another significant development, pensioners under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 will be able to access their pensions from any bank branch across India starting January 1, 2025. This means retirees will no longer be restricted to specific banks or branches.Even if a pensioner relocates or changes banks, pension disbursal will continue seamlessly through the Centralised Pension Processing System (CPPS), eliminating the need to transfer Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices.","Starting june 2025, epf members will be able to instantly withdraw pf funds via unified payments interface (upi) and atms.

NEW DELHI: Doubling of import duty on steel and aluminium by the Trump administration will dent export demand, with companies having to scout for alternative markets.Several US importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty, although India was not seen to be worse off, given that the same duty applies to all countries. But if Trump decides to move ahead with his threat, several American firms will have to slow down production as such duties are seen to be unviable and unsustainable. This will also reduce demand for inputs.""The economic impact will be significant. US steel prices are already high, at around $984 per metric tonne - far above European prices at $690 and Chinese prices at $392. The doubling of tariffs is expected to push US prices to about $1,180, squeezing US domestic industries such as automotive, construction, and manufacturing that depend on steel and aluminium as key inputs. These sectors may face hundreds of dollars in additional material costs per tonne, driving up prices, reducing competitiveness, and risking job losses or inflationary pressures,"" said trade research body GTRI.Fieo chief S C Ralhan said the increase in tariffs would have a significant bearing on India's steel exports, especially in semi-finished and finished categories like stainless steel pipes, structural steel components, and automotive steel parts.These products are part of India's growing engineering exports, and higher duties could erode our price competitiveness in the US market.EEPC India president Pankaj Chadha said, ""It's unfortunate that while bilateral trade talks are going on between India and the US, such unilateral tariff increases have be done. It only makes the work of negotiators more complicated.""Last fiscal, India exported steel and finished products of $6.2 billion to the US and about $0.9 billion of aluminium and its products. The US is among the top destinations for Indian exporters, who have been increasing market share through high-quality production and competitive pricing, Fieo said.","Several us importers have gone slow on fresh orders as costs went up significantly after the imposition of 25 per cent duty.

The upcoming hike in US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, announced by President Donald Trump , is set to impact Indian metal exports worth $4.56 billion, according to a new analysis by the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Beginning June 4, the higher duties are expected to raise product costs for Indian manufacturers and exporters in the American market, potentially affecting their competitiveness.“For India, the consequences are direct. In FY2025, India exported $4.56 billion worth of iron, steel, and aluminum products to the US,” said GTRI, as quoted by ANI.The US continues to be a key market for India’s metal sector. In FY2025, exports included $587.5 million worth of iron and steel, $3.1 billion in iron or steel products, and $860 million in aluminium and related items. The GTRI report cautions that increased tariffs on these categories will challenge India’s market share and profitability in the US.Trump on Friday announced plans to raise existing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25 per cent to 50 per cent, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The legislation enables the US president to impose trade restrictions if certain imports are found to pose a threat to national security.Read more: Donald Trump announces 50% tariff on steel imports from June 4 to 'secure industry in US' Trump initially invoked this provision in 2018, setting a 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium. These rates were revised in February 2025, with aluminium tariffs raised to 25 per cent.According to GTRI, the latest increase could drive US steel prices above $1,180 per tonne, with ripple effects on key sectors like automotive, construction, and manufacturing.India has filed a notification with the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding the tariff hike and is exploring additional response measures.GTRI also flagged the environmental implications of the US move. “Steel and aluminium manufacturing are significant carbon emitters globally. While other nations invest in environmentally friendly production methods, the US policy lacks environmental considerations,” the think tank noted.“This decision demonstrates the Trump administration's preference for economic nationalism over environmental stewardship,” GTRI said, adding that it raises questions about the US commitment to global climate goals and sustainable industrial development.","The us continues to be a key market for india’s metal sector.

NEW DELHI: The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%, amid concerns that Chinese goods may enter the market and hurt Indian steelmakers.""We have received complaints of Chinese players trying to blunt the impact of the safeguard action by circumventing it. We are mulling over various options,"" a senior government official told TOI.In late April, the government had notified a provisional safeguard duty of 12% for 200 days, and a detailed investigation will be required before a higher duty is imposed.With Chinese goods facing levies and other actions in several markets, especially the US, there are widespread fears of trade diversion with India seen as one of the markets where these goods could be dumped or sold at subsidised prices.India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, was also a net importer of finished steel for the second consecutive year in 2024-25. Imports are estimated to have neared the 10 million tonne mark.Small players have, however, been complaining about the adverse impact of the safeguard action as they have to deal with higher cost due to a price hike by domestic manufacturers after the safeguard action. The government will seek to strike a balance between the two sides, sources said.","The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%.

In contrast, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419 — a 1.7% increase year over year, AP reported.The AP’s annual survey includes data from 344 executives who filed proxy statements between January 1 and April 30.Despite economic concerns such as lingering inflation and elevated interest rates, the stock market soared in 2024. The S&P 500 gained more than 23%, while corporate profits rose over 9%, driving up performance-based compensation. Many companies have shifted CEO pay toward stock-based awards, which are often conditional on future targets like share price increases or improved profitability.“2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,” said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprises, led the list with a $164.5 million pay package. Nearly all of it consisted of stock awards tied to future performance through 2030. Axon, the maker of Tasers and body cameras, posted a record $377 million in net income and saw its shares more than double last year.Other high earners included:Most of these packages were heavily weighted toward stock and options. According to Equilar, the median value of stock awards climbed nearly 15%, while base salaries grew by only 4%.“For CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,"" said Melissa Burek, another partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. ""Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.”Jackie Cook of Morningstar Sustainalytics noted that linking CEO pay to stock performance may reflect shareholder priorities but warned it has “led to a ‘phenomenal rise’ in CEO compensation ‘tracking recent years' market performance,’ which has ‘widened the pay gap within workplaces.’”Some well-known CEOs were excluded from the rankings due to the survey's eligibility criteria. For instance, Starbucks’ Brian Niccol, whose 2024 compensation was valued at $95.8 million, only became CEO in September. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s $49.9 million package was not included as the company filed its proxy after the survey's deadline.Warren Buffett, known for his modest salary, was listed at $405,000—about five times the median worker's pay at Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla’s Elon Musk reported no compensation for 2024, although his 2018 stock package worth up to $56 billion remains under court review.The median CEO earned 192 times what the median worker at their company made. In some industries, the disparity is even more striking. Carnival Corp. reported a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of nearly 1,300:1, and McDonald's was close behind with a 1,000:1 gap.Private-sector wages rose 3.6% in 2024, with the average U.S. worker earning $65,460 annually, or $92,000 including benefits.“With CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,” said Sarah Anderson, director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies. ""These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value – they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates. ”The number of women on the list rose to 27, the highest since 2014. Their median compensation was $20 million — a 10.7% rise compared to 9.7% for male CEOs, who earned a median of $16.8 million.Top-earning female CEOs included:“There are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we’re really not moving the needle significantly,” said Christy Glass, a sociology professor at Utah State University. She cited the broader slowdown in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts.Equilar found companies are increasingly offering security-related perks as part of executive compensation, possibly influenced by incidents such as the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.Among 208 companies reviewed, median spending on executive security rose from $69,180 in 2023 to $94,276 in 2024. Notable increases came from companies like Centene and Intel.","Compensation for ceos at s&p 500 companies jumped nearly 10% in 2024, as stock prices surged and corporate profits swelled.
