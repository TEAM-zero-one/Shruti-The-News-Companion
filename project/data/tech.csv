Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one.

MUMBAI: The Siddhivinayak temple trust, Prabhadevi, has reported record annual earnings of Rs 133 crore for the financial year 2024-25. The sum marks a 15% increase over Rs 114 crore in 2023-24, said executive officer Veena Patil.The managing committee presented its annual budget on March 31. The temple's revenue is expected to rise to Rs 154 crore in the next financial year 2025-26.Siddhivinayak's deputy executive officer Sandeep Rathod said, ""Owing to the administration's efficiency, our income expected to be Rs 114 crore rose to a record Rs 133 crore, surpassing the trust's own estimates by 15%. We have seen if devotees are facilitated with smooth darshan, if queues move swiftly in an orderly fashion, more people can take darshan, thus increasing donations. It ensures a pleasant visit experience. In Siddhivinayak, each devotee gets 10-15 seconds for darshan, which according to me, fares better than other large shrines which grant 5-7 seconds. As a result, people's hearts are inclined to donate more.""Revenues are assessed from 'daan peti' earnings, puja rituals, sale of laddoo and nariyal wadi prasad, online donations and gold-silver offerings. The monies are routed to the trust's welfare activities. ""We do adjust revenue assessment for inflation. Even though prices of food items and gold prices have risen, we have seen more items being auctioned in our gold-silver.

Gisele Bündchen’s post-baby glow is unreal—see her jaw-dropping look in new fitness snaps



Supermodel Gisele Bündchen radiated elegance and serenity as she soaked up Miami’s spring sunshine in a relaxed outing with her partner, Joaquim Valente. Just a month after welcoming their first child together, the 44-year-old Brazilian beauty seemed at ease, seamlessly blending her role as a new mother with her love for the outdoors.Gisele Bündchen, known for her impeccable style and enviable physique, took to the waters for a peaceful water bike ride. Dressed in a sophisticated black halter-style sports bra paired with coordinating shorts, she embodied effortless grace. Her natural, sun-kissed tresses cascaded over her shoulders, and her choice of oversized black sunglasses and a wide-brimmed straw hat added both practicality and charm to her look. She pedaled barefoot, embracing the feel of the ocean beneath her.Beside her was Joaquim Valente, the jiu-jitsu instructor who transitioned from a longtime friend to a romantic partner in 2023. Dressed casually in a black tee, printed shorts, and a backwards cap, he exuded an air of relaxation, enjoying the quality time with Gisele.The couple has been spotted on multiple outings recently, including a scenic boat day in Biscayne Bay, where Gisele showcased her effortless style in a sleek black one-piece swimsuit, complemented by a flowing wrap skirt. A nearby baby bassinet hinted at her new journey intomotherhood , as she engaged in lively conversation with a friend while Joaquim took a refreshing dip.In February Gisele had given birth to a baby boy—her third child and first with Joaquim. The baby’s middle name, River, carries a poetic connection to nature, aligning beautifully with the names of Gisele’s older children, Benjamin Rein, 15, and Vivian Lake, 11, whom she shares with ex-husband Tom Brady .The birth took place in early 2025, though the exact date remains private. Yet, despite the recent addition to her family, Gisele has already resumed light yoga and daily walks, often accompanied by her newborn. Her ability to balance wellness and motherhood showcases her deep commitment to both.While Gisele embraces this new phase, Tom Brady remains deeply engaged in his business ventures and sports commitments. As a co-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he has an influential role in shaping the team’s future, particularly with the upcoming NFL Draft where the team holds the No. 6 pick. Additionally, he continues his career as a football analyst for Fox Sports, further cementing his post-NFL legacy.Despite their different paths, Brady acknowledged Gisele’s new chapter in a subtle yet thoughtful manner. Upon learning about the birth of her child, he shared an introspective quote on his Instagram story: ""I really think the secret to being loved is to love. And the secret to being interesting is to be interested. And the secret to have others find beauty in you is to find beauty in others. And the secret to having a friend is being a friend.""Meanwhile, Gisele has made a striking return to modeling. Just weeks after giving birth, she dazzled in a campaign for a luxury German-Swedish fashion brand. A veteran of the fashion world, she has worked with esteemed brands such as Victoria's Secret, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, and Michael Kors. Her comeback is a testament to her enduring influence in the industry, proving that motherhood and professional success can harmoniously coexist.Also Read: Val Kilmer’s intense performances defined an era— NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt pays heartfelt tribute to late ‘Top Gun’ star As Gisele and Joaquim enjoy their new journey together, fans eagerly await glimpses of their growing family while watching the supermodel redefine beauty, grace, and strength in her own signature way.","Gisele bündchen and partner joaquim valente enjoyed a water bike ride in miami.

Tesla's stock performance

Tesla 's sales fell in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 13% drop and indicating potential challenges ahead for the electric vehicle giant, according to news agency AP.The decline, which saw global deliveries fall to 336,681 units in the January-March period, down from 387,000 during the same period last year, is attributed to a combination of factors, including an aging vehicle line-up, increased competition, and backlash from CEO Elon Musk 's embrace of right-wing politics.Despite offering deep discounts, zero financing, and other incentives, Tesla still fell short of analysts’ expectations, in which FactSet expected much higher deliveries of 408,000.Tesla's electric car sales in Europe have seen significant drops, with March figures showing a 36.8 percent decline in France, according to data from the Automotive Platform (PFA). The overall electric vehicle market in France also experienced a slight dip during the same period, news agency AFP reported.In Sweden, Tesla sales plunged by 63.9 percent in March and 55.2 percent for the first quarter of the year, according to Mobility Sweden.Notably, the Tesla Model Y, which was the top-selling car in Sweden during the first quarter of 2024, has now fallen behind two Volvos, the luxury Volkswagen ID.7, and a Subaru in sales. Similarly, Tesla's sales in Denmark dropped by 56 percent in the first quarter, according to Mobility Denmark. Figures for March sales in Germany, Britain, and Italy will be released in the coming days.Tesla's stock has plummeted by about 50% since hitting a record high in mid-December, as initial expectations of lighter regulation and significant profits under a Donald Trump presidency have been replaced by growing concerns over protests against CEO Elon Musk and other issues potentially hurting the company.Analysts remain uncertain about the exact impact of these protests on sales, as the overall electric vehicle ( EV ) market has also been sluggish. Tesla, in particular, is facing challenges as potential buyers hold off on purchasing its best-selling Model Y, anticipating an updated version later this year.Moreover, Tesla has lost market share to increasing competition, with rivals like BYD gaining ground. The Chinese EV leader recently unveiled technology enabling its cars to charge in just a few minutes, further intensifying the pressure on Tesla.Tesla’s shares dropped more than 4% before the market opened on Wednesday.","Tesla deliveries fell to 336,681 units in the january-march period, down from 387,000 during the same period last year.
