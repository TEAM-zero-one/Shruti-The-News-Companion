TCS Layoffs: NITES Wants Halt On Terminations

Other Trade Unions Also Slam TCS

TCS layoffs: The news of TCS planning to sack thousands of employees has led to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) writing to Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya . India’s biggest IT services firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Sunday said it would be laying off around 12,000 employees over the course of the year, which means an approximate 2% cut in its workforce.With this TCS is set to implement its biggest workforce reduction ever. Previously, the company had terminated approximately 3,000 employees in 2015, which was around 1% of its total staff at that time. This is reportedly the biggest mass layoff that the Indian IT industry is set to witness.NITES, an IT workers' union, has written a letter to Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings announced by Tata Consultancy Services.According to an ET report, the IT workers' organisation challenged the legality of these dismissals and requested official instructions be issued to TCS to ""halt all terminations and reinstate affected employees.""Also Read | TCS layoffs ‘biggest ever’ for Indian IT! Artificial Intelligence not to blame for ‘difficult’ decision? Top 10 things to know about mass sackings The union emphasised that permitting a corporation of TCS's magnitude to conduct large-scale layoffs and firings without proper procedures or accountability would establish the wrong standard for other organisations, leading to employment uncertainty, diminished worker protections, and reduced confidence in India's labour environment.NITES urged the Ministry to hold the company's senior leadership responsible, particularly given the CEO's salary increase during a period of widespread job cuts.According to TCS's annual report, CEO K Krithivasan received Rs 26.5 crore in FY25, representing a 4.6% increase from the previous financial year. The report indicated that his compensation was 329.8 times the median employee salary.Additionally, NITES called for an investigation into TCS's delayed onboarding practices. Earlier this month, the union had highlighted concerns regarding delays in the lateral recruitment of 600 professionals.IT sector employee unions have labelled the dismissals unlawful and encouraged TCS staff facing redundancy to resist resignation pressures. The Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union has appealed to the technology major to withdraw its staff reduction strategy and restore positions of impacted workers.The Forum for IT Employees (FITE) has recommended that TCS should avoid applying direct pressure on employees to resign. Instead, they advised the company to provide notice period remuneration, severance packages and extend health insurance benefits for a 12-month period.Also Read | ‘Don’t resign under pressure….’: TCS layoffs opposed by IT employee unions; IT giant to sack 12,000 employees","Nites, an it workers' union, has written a letter to union labour minister mansukh mandaviya, voicing concerns regarding the mass sackings.

The ministry seeks to understand the root causes behind this development.The matter is significant as TCS, India's premier IT services company, plans to reduce its workforce by 12,261 employees, representing two per cent of its global staff this year, with middle and senior management positions bearing the majority of the impact.As of 30 June 2025, TCS employed 6,13,069 people, having added 5,000 new staff during the April-June quarter.The company announced on Sunday that this restructuring aligns with their strategy to become a ""future-ready organisation"", emphasising technological investments, AI implementation, market growth, and workforce reorganisation.""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation.

TCS has not complied with any of these legal requirements,"" NITES alleged, terming the action a blatant and wilful violation of the law.NITES also highlighted the devastating impact of the layoffs, stating that thousands of working professionals with families, EMIs, and financial commitments would suddenly lose their livelihood. ""The psychological, emotional, and financial trauma of this move is unimaginable,"" Harpreet Singh Saluja, President of NITES, wrote in the letter.The union further contended that TCS' actions cannot be justified as restructuring. NITES also emphasised that TCS's proposed move ""will normalise job insecurity, erode employee rights, and severely damage trust in India's employment ecosystem.""Additionally, NITES has called for the framing of stricter safeguards for the IT sector, arguing that the industry currently suffers from a lack of enforceable employment protections. ""If this injustice is not addressed immediately, NITES, along with allied IT employee unions across India, will be forced to organise nationwide protests, legal campaigns, and public demonstrations to ensure that the voices of thousands of affected employees are heard,"" the union stated.Market watchers believe that TCS's decision to slash 12,000 jobs this year is likely to send fresh tremors through the tech industry, which has been battling global macroeconomic woes and geopolitical uncertainty.In another news, faces a disconnect between its operational performance and market sentiment.

Philip Tomasino arrives in Pittsburgh Penguins at critical career turning points



Competition heats up as Tomasino battles for long-term alignment in Pittsburgh Penguins' top six



Philip Tomasino hopes to cement his NHL career with the Pittsburgh Penguins as the team makes a shift toward a younger, quicker core. Acquired from the Nashville Predators in late 2024, Philip Tomasino is a 24-year-old winger who is among general manager Kyle Dubas' calculated signings designed to add youthful energy to a roster still spearheaded by veterans Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Now at a critical juncture, Philip Tomasino is looking to transition from a depth contributor to a consistent middle-six scorer.When the Pittsburgh Penguins sent a 2027 fourth-round draft pick to the Nashville Predators for Philip Tomasino, the trade seemed like a low-risk, high-reward gamble. For an organization that has attempted too many times to balance its legendary veteran core with sustained roster building, having a 23-year-old former first-round pick fall into their lap was Kyle Dubas' rebuild prototype to a T.Philip Tomasino signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in November 2024 and was plugged into the NHL lineup right away. There being a depth issue in front, he played meaningful minutes, playing 50 games during the 2024–25 season. He scored 11 goals and 23 points, but consistency was still a problem. Philip Tomasino had three separate periods of six or more games without scoring a point—a habit that would keep him from rising the lineup if not addressed.Tomasino's role in the future is uncertain, partially because the Penguins have a crowded cadre of middle-six forwards. In addition to stalwarts such as Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell, the Penguins brought in Anthony Mantha, Thomas Novak, Rutger McGroarty, and Ville Koivunen, all of whom are competing for scarce minutes alongside Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin.While the Penguins would like to shed cap space and perhaps part ways with veteran wingers Rust and Rakell, a window of opportunity can create itself. But Tomasino has to show he can do it consistently to gain a top-six spot. His one-year, $1.75 million deal is a ""show-me"" situation—he's a restricted free agent in the offseason and must have a solid season to find a long-term spot in the Penguins' plans.Kyle Dubas has made it plain that the Penguins are building for the future. The team added three forwards in the first round of the 2025 NHL Draft recently and owns 17 picks in rounds one through three in the next three drafts. There is no mistaking the message: competition will only increase, and Tomasino must adapt beyond being a streaky scorer if he wants to stay in the mix.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Kyle Connor likely to re-sign as Winnipeg Jets pursue long-term contract extension amid NHL free agency buzz Philip Tomasino heads into the 2025–26 NHL season with more chances than ever, but with more stress.

Surrounded by some of the best in the game and up-and-coming rivals as well, this season may set Tomasino's course in the league.

Apple is expected to announce its iPhone 17 series in the first week of September. As the launch gets closer, rumours and leaks about the 2025 iPhone lineup have increased. In a latest, a user has been caught using – what appears to be Apple iPhone 17 Pro – in the wild. Images of the alleged smartphone have been shared by an X user named Fox Puppy. While the authenticity of the images remain unverified, the user claims that the “guy on the right was security and trying to go in front of the iPhone to hide it”.Clearly, the alleged iPhone 17 Pro in the leaked photos can be seen covered in a thick black case. Silver camera rings are visible on the left, and the LiDAR sensor and flash appear to be moved to the right. These placements match earlier mockups and leaks shared in recent months.The X post was quoted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, saying “Wow. This looks legit”.Tipster Majin Bu, in a blog post, has claimed that Apple may reposition the Apple logo which is currently placed slightly off-center and below the camera module since the iPhone X. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, the logo may now be moved lower, toward the center bottom of the phone. “This recent discovery, reported by direct sources among case manufacturers, marks an evolution in Apple’s aesthetic language,” Bu writes.The report adds that the repositioning of Apple logo has raised concerns among manufacturers about possible interference, leading the industry to look for ways to ensure continued compatibility. Some factories have already produced cases based on the current design and are waiting for official confirmation before making changes. To address the issue, case makers are working on design changes.A report by The Information previously said that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with a redesigned rear panel composed of both aluminum and glass. It may feature an aluminum rear panel, housing a camera bump, bigger than the one found on the iPhone 16 Pro models.The report further added that the iPhone 17 Pro may come with an aluminium frame, replacing the titanium frame like their predecessors.On the specifications part, the phone may come powered by Apple’s A19 Pro chip , manufactured using TSMC’s 3nm process. iPhone 17 Pro is said to offer 12GB of RAM, up from the iPhone 16 Pro’s 8GB. For camera duties, it may have a 48MP telephoto lens, replacing the 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro. For selfies, the smartphone is tipped to have a 24MP sensor.",A user has been caught using – what appears to be apple iphone 17 pro – in the wild.

Microsoft cuts 15,000+ jobs across multiple divisions despite record profits

AI revolution drives management restructuring as technology writes 30% of code

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivered a sobering message to employees Wednesday as the company announced its fourth round of layoffs this year, eliminating 9,000 more positions and bringing total workforce reductions to over 15,000 this year.""Before anything else, I want to speak to what's been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations. These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we've worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends,"" Nadella wrote in an internal memo addressing the latest cuts affecting 4% of Microsoft's 228,000 global workforce.The CEO continued: ""I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.""The year-long elimination spree began with performance-based cuts in earlier in the year, escalated with 6,000 layoffs in May targeting software engineers and project managers, continued with 300+ June reductions, and culminated in Wednesday's 9,000-person reduction. The gaming division suffered the heaviest losses, with over 3,000 positions eliminated since Microsoft's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition closed in 2023.High-profile casualties include The Initiative studio's complete closure, cancellation of anticipated titles Perfect Dark and Everwild, and 200 job cuts at King, maker of Candy Crush. Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told gaming employees the cuts would ""position Gaming for enduring success"" while acknowledging the timing during Microsoft's strongest gaming performance period.Despite the workforce reductions, Microsoft reported $25.8 billion in quarterly net income with 18% year-over-year growth, maintaining its position among the S&P 500's most profitable companies.Nadella addressed the apparent contradiction between strong financial performance and mass layoffs, describing it as ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value."" The CEO emphasised Microsoft's transformation from a ""software factory to an intelligence engine"" while the company invests $80 billion in AI infrastructure this fiscal year.The strategic shift reflects AI's growing role in Microsoft's operations, with artificial intelligence now writing up to 30% of code in some company projects. Microsoft has systematically targeted middle management layers to eliminate organizational barriers and increase decision-making speed, mirroring similar restructuring efforts by Amazon and Meta.Affected employees receive comprehensive severage packages including healthcare coverage and job placement assistance, with priority consideration for other Microsoft positions. The restructuring aligns with Microsoft's new fiscal year launch, when the company traditionally announces major organisational changes.","Microsoft cuts 15,000+ jobs across multiple divisions despite record profits.

How the plan works



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells $36.4 million in stock



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has recently sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million. According to the filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the transactions were executed between July 24 to July 28. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $172.07 to $176.37, near Nvidia’s 52-week high of $177. Despite this sale of stock, Huang still owns more than 73.8 million shares of the company. This recent sale of stock by Huang is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which was adopted by the Nvidia CEO in March this year. The trading plan is created to allow company insiders to sell shares without facing any accusations of insider trading. The sale is said to be a part of a planned disinvestment strategy by Huang. However, the key to understanding these sales lies in the nature of a Rule 10b5-1 plan.The rule 10b5-1 is a regulation created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule enables the corporate insiders to sell company shares via a predefined trading plan. It also acts as an affirmative defense against the charges of insider trading.- Pre-planned transitions: The plan enable the insiders to establish a written trading plan at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information (MNPI) about their company.- Specific parameters: The plan must also reveal the amount, price and date of trades or include a formula for determining them.- No discretion: Once the plan is established, after the insider cannot exercise any influence over the trades. The transactions are they automatically executed as per the pre-set schedule.- Transparency: These trading plans are disclosed publicly via the SEC filings in order to provide transparency to the market.The main objective of the rule 10b5-1 trading plan is to enable insiders to diversify their portfolios, manage liquidity and meet personal financial obligations. So, in case of Nvidia CEO selling stocks under a Rule 10b5-1 plan suggest that these transactions were scheduled well in advance before the recent market developments or company-specific news.This is the second time in July that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold the company stocks. Earlier in July, Huang sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. This transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang has sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar pichai is now worth $1.1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.

Time to change the working model



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recently announced its plans to lay off 12,000 employees which is roughly 2% of its workforce. Now, former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani has shared a thought-provoking message to the Indian tech industry. Quoting the iconic dialogue from popular Bollywood film Sholay “Kitney aadmi the?... Thank God that period will be over.” Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gurnani has urged the tech industry to move beyond the obsession of headcount and embrace outcome-based models. Gurnani stresses on a shift from the traditional pyramid-style delivery system which has long been associated with Indian IT. He further emphasise that the Indian tech industry should prioritise enhanced productivity, specialised skills, and advanced technological capabilities.During the recent round of layoffs, TCS insists that the job cuts are not driven by AI but by skill mismatch and the need to realign talent with emerging business demands. TCS CEO K Krithivasan also clarified that the decision of the company is majorly driven by deployment feasibility and not productive gains from AI.Apart from TCS, Infosys and Wipro have also witnessed a decline in headcounters from over 12,000 and 25,000, respectively, in the past two years. Additional, HCLTech also announced restructuring at the company due to location and skill mismatches. Also, experts suggest that the roles such as low level coding, testing and documentation have now become obsolete.For decades, India's IT prowess has been built on its vast talent pool. However, as global demands shift towards more complex, niche, and AI-driven solutions, the emphasis is increasingly on quality over quantity. Former Nassscom chairman Ganesh Natarajan also spoke in support of Gurnani’s viewpoint. Natarajan called the pyramid model as ‘Jurassic Park material’. He also feels that agentic AI — software that autonomously performs complex tasks—will force companies to rethink team structures and delivery models.Analyst are also of the viewpoint that the layoffs may also increase due to the market share shifts and vendor consolidation, not just automation. The entry level jobs at BPO and customer service roles are the most vulnerable.Gurnani’s message aims to encourage Indian tech professionals to upskill and reskill and embrace new technologies.",Former tech mahindra ceo cp gurnani has shared a thought-provoking message to the indian tech industry.

Nayara Energy – Indian refiner backed by Russia has initiated a legal action against Microsoft alleging that the US-based software giant abruptly cut off access to essential services. According to a Reuters report, the company claims that Microsoft’s move was “unilateral” and made without consultation. “Microsoft is currently restricting Nayara Energy’s access to its own data, proprietary tools, and products—despite these being acquired under fully paid-up licenses,” the company said in a statement.For those unaware, Nayara operates the country’s third-largest refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat in addition to over 6,000 fuel stations. The company typically exports at least four million barrels of refined products per month, including diesel, jet fuel, gasoline and naphtha.The dispute follows Microsoft’s decision last Tuesday to suspend services for Nayara Energy. Since then, the company's staff have reportedly been unable to access Outlook email and Microsoft Teams.Nayara claims the suspension came “without prior notice, consultation or recourse, and under the guise of compliance.”In response, Mumbai-based Nayara Energy has filed a legal petition with the Delhi High Court , seeking an interim injunction and immediate restoration of services. In its petition, the company says that the aim is to “safeguard its rights and ensure continued access to essential digital infrastructure.”Nayara Energy, a significant buyer of Russian crude, was recently sanctioned by the European Union. The company is majority-owned by Russian entities, including Rosneft. Since the sanctions were imposed, at least two ships skipped loading at its Vadinar refinery , and a tanker carrying Russian Urals crude was rerouted.Amid these challenges, Nayara’s chief executive Des Dorides resigned recently. Denisov has been with Nayara since 2017. His LinkedIn profile describes him as Nayara's chief development office. The company has appointed Sergey Denisov as the new CEO.","Nayara energy is majority-owned by russian entities, including rosneft.

Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating YouTube accounts starting December. This comes after the federal government reverses its earlier stance to exempt the platform from national social media restrictions for under-16s, reports the Guardian.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and communications minister Anika Wells are expected to formally announce the decision on Wednesday, the same day YouTube is set to host a major event for MPs at Parliament House, a move likely to spark tension with the Google-owned giant.“Social media has a social responsibility and there is no doubt that Australian kids are being negatively impacted by online platforms so I’m calling time on it,” Albanese stated. “Social media is doing social harm to our children, and I want Australian parents to know that we have their backs.”This decision follows a recommendation from the internet regulator last week, urging the government to reverse YouTube’s exemption. A survey earlier revealed that around 37 percent of minors encountered harmful content on the platform, reports Reuters.Apart from YouTube, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others are on the list of age-restricted social media sites.The move comes after eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant highlighted findings from a recent survey of 2,600 children, revealing that nearly 40% had encountered harmful content on YouTube making it “the most frequently cited platform in our research”.The under-16 bans are set to take place in December, with platforms facing penalties of up to $49.5m if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to prevent children from creating accounts. Some major tech companies have expressed concerns over what constitutes “reasonable steps"" to comply with the new rules.The legislation only limits children from holding accounts, they will still be able to watch YouTube, notes Inman Grant.“The Albanese government is giving kids a reprieve from the persuasive and pervasive pull of social media while giving parents peace of mind,” said Anika Wells. “There’s a place for social media, but there’s not a place for predatory algorithms targeting children.”“There is no one perfect solution when it comes to keeping young Australians safer online – but the social media minimum age will make a significantly positive difference to their wellbeing,” she added.“YouTube is a video sharing platform, not a social media service, that offers benefit and value to younger Australians,” a YouTube spokesperson said on Sunday, reports the Guardian.",Australia will be blocking children under 16 from creating youtube accounts starting december.

What is the truth of Julian Brown's 'disappearance'?



Pyrolysis is not something new

The Atlanta inventor has 1.7 million followers on Instagram who raised concerns about the well-being of the TikTok scientist who was making usable gas from plastic. Brown's followers Monday stormed all social media platforms, reporting him missing, urging FBI chief Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino to launch an investigation -- while there was no report of any missing person.Julian Brown disappeared from social media after claiming that he was under attack and some very strange things were happening to him. 'Something is happening, keep me in your prayers please. SCREEN RECORD THIS. I don’t know,' Brown wrote on the post. ""I’m certainly under attack... I can’t go into so much detail,"" Brown said, asking his followers to keep their eyes open.His followers expressed apprehension on social media that he was probably killed, kidnapped or silenced for his invention.But his mother Nia Brown told DailyMail that Julian was safe. He was keeping a low profile for his safety and so she could not reveal any further details about Julian, his location etc.'I can confirm Julian is safe but in the best interest of his security I'm not able to provide any more information,' she said.Experts on social media argued that Julian Brown did not discover anything new.
