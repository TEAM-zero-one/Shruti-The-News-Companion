Novo Nordisk to phase out its largest insulin brand in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/novo-nordisk-to-phase-out-its-largest-insulin-brand-in-india/articleshow/120501423.cms,"In a move which could shake up the diabetes market, Novo Nordisk is discontinuing the country’s largest selling insulin, Human Mixtard, among other older insulin brands in India. Human Mixtard alone is a Rs 800 crore brand for Novo Nordisk in India, despite it being under price control. Besides Human Mixtard, the phase-out could impact its top brands in the Rs 5,000 crore insulin market including Actrapid, Insulatard, Insulin Detemir and Levemir and Xultophy — marketed mostly in the format of pre-filled disposable pen and cartridges (Penfill and FlexPen).The company recently informed its marketing partner, Abbott India that the products would be discontinued once the current stocks are exhausted, documents accessed by TOI said. This could take about six months.The decision is in line with the global strategy of the Danish company to prioritise newer, patented blockbuster diabetes and weight loss therapies including Ozempic and Wegovy , due to their higher profitability, sources said. Also, it seems to be potentially in line with its plans to introduce these therapies in the Indian market this year.As part of its global strategy, earlier generation insulin products will be discontinued globally in a gradual manner. An email sent on April 17 to the company went unanswered.However, the company plans to continue selling Human Mixtard, Actrapid and Insulatard, in vials — which can be delivered to patients through injections. This may limit the access further as insulin delivery from pen devices is preferred by a huge majority of diabetics over vials injected with syringes, due to its accuracy, ease of dosing, and reduced stigma, a survey said earlier.","Human mixtard alone is a rs 800 crore brand for novo nordisk in india.

What Is the New Zealand Trick?

up to 18 hours

Can It Work for Oblivion Remastered?

If Oblivion Remastered gets a global digital launch based on local timezones, then yes — you might be able to use the New Zealand trick to jump in early.

But if it launches at a fixed global time (say, April 21 at 12 PM EST), then changing your region won’t help. The game will unlock for everyone at the exact same moment, no matter where you are in the world.

The Oblivion Remaster Is REAL… And There’s More Than One!

Is the Trick Worth Trying?

Final Thoughts

Oblivion Remastered

If you’re a die-hard Elder Scrolls fan, you’re probably already counting down the seconds to the release of. But here’s the million-gold question floating around the community right now — can you use the classic “New Zealand trick” to play it early?If you’ve ever wanted to play a game early on release day, you’ve probably heard of this trick. The “New Zealand trick” is a method that involves changing your console or PC's location to New Zealand — the first country to roll into a new calendar day due to time zones.Because games tied to global digital launches often unlock based on the region’s local time, New Zealand players sometimes get access to gamesbefore others. Players in the U.S., UK, or Europe often change their region to New Zealand to piggyback on this early access window.It’s totally legal, easy to do, and has been a long-time favorite move for gamers looking to jump in early.Short answer: It depends on how Bethesda handles the launch.Right now, there’s strong speculation that the game might shadow drop soon, possibly as early as April 21. But whether it's a timed unlock or a rolling launch hasn’t been confirmed yet.Honestly, yes — if you're playing on Xbox or PC via Game Pass, switching your region to New Zealand is quick and safe. Worst-case scenario, it doesn’t work and you just wait like everyone else. Best-case? You're strolling through the Imperial City before your friends even finish their coffee.Just remember to switch your region back after the game unlocks. It can affect things like store currency, local apps, and services.With all the excitement (and rumors) swirling around, it’s hard to sit still. Whether Bethesda lets us sneak in through a time zone loophole or holds the line with a synchronized drop, one thing's clear — Tamriel is calling again, and it's going to look better than ever.","The “new zealand trick’ is a method that involves changing your console or pc's location to new zealand.

Tesla India Plans

Elon Musk-led Tesla has started talks with American memory chip manufacturer Micron and Mumbai's CG Semi , a Murugappa Group subsidiary, to explore supply alternatives whilst expanding its global supply network, according to informed sources. This development follows Tesla's earlier strategic partnership with Tata Electronics for semiconductor procurement for worldwide operations. Elon Musk announced on X on Saturday about his anticipated visit to India this year.""Tesla spoke to representatives from the three large semiconductor facilities that have taken off in India — Micron, CG Semi and Tata Electronics,"" a source told ET. It ""called meetings about a month-and-a-half ago… to get a sense of what kind of chips are expected to be packaged, when they'll be ramping up and the timelines for operations.""The Gujarat-based Micron facility aims to provide assembly and testing capabilities, serving both domestic and international markets. CG Semi's unit will focus on OSAT operations. This collaboration between CG Power, Renesas and Stars Microelectronics will primarily serve Renesas whilst catering to global clients.Various Tata enterprises including AutoComp, Consultancy Services, Technologies and Electronics have established themselves as Tesla's global suppliers, preparing for expanded roles should the EV maker enter India.Tata Electronics has committed investments of Rs 91,000 crore for a semiconductor manufacturing unit in Dholera, Gujarat, alongside a Rs 27,000 crore OSAT facility planned in Morigaon, Assam.Murugappa's CG Semi is establishing an OSAT facility in Sanand with an investment of Rs 7,600 crore, alongside Micron's assembly, testing, marking, and packaging (ATMP) facility, valued at over Rs 23,000 crore ($2.7 billion).Industry experts note that international companies are increasingly considering India for semiconductor operations as they diversify their supply chains. Independent automotive analyst Ashwin Amberkar says, ""There are strong indications that Tesla has started engaging suppliers beyond China and Taiwan, with targets set as early as 2025. India is emerging as a serious contender in this shift.""Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory currently depends on Chinese fabrication facilities for mature-node chips. However, Amberkar notes that escalating geopolitical tensions and cost increases are compelling Tesla to ""rethink its sourcing strategy.""Amberkar explains that CG Semi is developing a comprehensive OSAT facility in Gujarat, whilst Micron's Sanand unit will specialise in automotive-grade dynamic random-access memory for computer processors.According to him, Tata's proposed fab and OSAT facilities could fulfil legacy-node chip requirements for automotive electronic control units or specialised vehicle computers.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India China's move to impose over 80% import duties on semiconductor products, in response to US tariffs, is likely to affect traditional semiconductor supply networks. This situation will encourage global automotive manufacturers such as Tesla to diversify their supply sources.The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD operates its own semiconductor division. ""It becomes a crucial part of Tesla's whole EV plan to have an in-house semiconductor unit, have a steady supply chain as well with multiple vendors not overly dependent on one country,"" said industry veteran Arun Mampazhy.Original equipment manufacturers seek robust and varied supply chains, not solely for protection from geopolitical issues, but also to reduce operational disruptions and price fluctuations. Despite strong governmental support, India's semiconductor sector continues to face challenges regarding scale and ecosystem development.""Partnering with a global EV leader could be catalytic for India's chip ambitions,"" said analyst Amberkar.Nevertheless, India must address the technological advantages of China whilst maintaining competitive pricing structures.",Elon musk-led tesla has started talks with american memory chip manufacturer micron and mumbai's cg semi.

Who is Lucy Guo

About the Thiel Fellowship

It's over for Taylor Swift. The Music Queen has lost her status as the youngest self-made billionaire woman. At just 30, serial entrepreneur Lucy Guo has surpassed pop icon Taylor Swift to become the youngest self-made woman billionaire, according to Forbes. This milestone coincides with a major financial leap for her former startup, Scale AI , which is nearing a tender offer set for June 1. The deal, valuing the AI data annotation firm at $25 billion—an 80% jump from its $13.8 billion valuation last May—allows early employees and investors to cash out shares.Guo co-founded Scale AI in 2016, a company pivotal to the AI industry, providing essential data organization for machine learning models. Its clients include the US government and OpenAI. A first-generation Chinese-American from the Bay Area, Guo taught herself to code in middle school, briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University, and then left to join the Thiel Fellowship , a $100,000 grant program for young entrepreneurs founded by Peter Thiel, popularly known as Donald Trump's man in Silicon Valley. In fact it was PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel who introduced his mentee, JD Vance, to President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2021.Before Scale AI, Guo worked at Quora, where she met co-founder Alexandr Wang, and later at Snapchat. After leaving Scale, she launched Backend Capital, a venture capital firm, and invested in startups like Ramp, now valued at billions. In 2022, she founded Passes, a subscription-based platform for creators akin to OnlyFans, which has raised $50 million and is valued at $150 million. Celebrities like Olivia Dunne and Shaquille O’Neal use the platform. Passes is a platform enabling creators to monetize their brands through subscriptions, live streams, one-on-one calls, and fan management tools.Guo’s rise from a self-taught coder to a billionaire embodies the Silicon Valley dream, unseating Taylor Swift, 35, who held the title since Forbes named her a billionaire in 2023.Founded by Peter Thiel, the Thiel Fellowship provides $100,000 and mentorship to young innovators who skip or leave college to pursue entrepreneurial ventures over two years. Incidentally, Thiel’s venture fund, Founders Fund, was also an early investor in several of Elon Musk’s companies, including space cargo business SpaceX, tunneling firm the Boring Company, and brain-chip startup Neuralink.","Lucy guo, 30, has surpassed taylor swift to become the youngest self-made woman billionaire, according to forbes.

The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos. One user commented, “Jeff Bezos is an American and as such pays income taxes to the US, thank you for coming to my TED talk.” Another wrote, “Sending more money to the government is more wasteful than sending money to space.”","Billboard features amazon founder jeff bezos alongside pop star katy perry.

Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) is a market leader in aerospace defence. It boasts a strong order book of ₹1.8t as of Mar '25, along with a promising prospect pipeline of ₹6t, which is likely to be awarded over next few years. HAL is transitioning from traditional licensed model to indigenized model and is currently working on marque projects such as Tejas Mk1, Tejas Mk1a, Su-30 upgrade, Dornier-25, and LUH, et al. These projects are anticipated to fuel manufacturing revenue growth for HAL. Near-term catalysts will emerge with aircraft deliveries as GE engine supplies resumes for Tejas Mk1A from FY26, while medium to long term triggers hinge on order finalizations for 97 Tejas Mk1A, Tejas Mk-II, LUH, AMCA and others. We initiate coverage on HAL with BUY rating & TP ₹5,100. We estimate 29%/33%/29% revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR over FY25-27.Brent Crude has fallen to its 4-year low amid US-China trade tensions and rising supply.This is beneficial for lubricant companies like Castrol, potentially leading to improved profit margins. As part of its future plans for advanced EV and data center testing, Castrol opened a technology center in Patalganga, equipped with blending & testing capabilities. For its lubricant business, it is targeting above industry average growth rate of 4-5%. Management is optimistic about India’s lubricant demand potential, driven by low car penetration. Castrol's focus on brand building, distribution, and new products supports its market leadership. We estimate ~23% EBITDA margin for CY25 and CY26, reflecting confidence in profitability and growth.","According to motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting april 21, 2025) are hindustan aeronautics and castrol.

Google to pay Rs 20 crore to settle Android TV case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/google-to-pay-rs-20-crore-to-settle-android-tv-case/articleshow/120497556.cms,"NEW DELHI: Google has opted for a settlement with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and payment of a penalty of Rs 20.2 crore in the Android TV issue, where the fairplay regulator found a prima facie case of abuse of dominant position by the global tech giant.This follows the two penalties that CCI previously slapped on Google, regarding its Play Store policies and its dominance in the Android operating system.In the TV case, Google filed a settlement application under Section 48A of the Competition Act, giving consent for a 'New India Agreement', under which it will provide a standalone licence for the Play Store and Play Services for Android smart TVs in India. This will remove the requirement to bundle these services or impose default placement conditions, CCI said. Additionally, by waiving the need for a valid Android Compatibility Commitment (ACC) for devices shipped into India that do not include Google apps, TV companies can now sell and develop incompatible Android devices, without violating Google's Television App Distribution Agreement (TADA), it added. ""... considering the material on record and the assessment of the settlement proposal after taking into consideration the nature, gravity, and impact of the contraventions, the commission agrees to the proposal for settlement in terms of Section 48A (3) of the Act and the settlement regulations.
