These top 10 richest billionaires not only hold staggering personal fortunes but also shape the global economy with their innovative ideas and strategic ventures. According to Forbes, nine out of these ten billionaires are American, showcasing the dominance of the US in wealth creation, while Bernard Arnault represents Europe’s luxury empire. From Elon Musk’s space ambitions to Jeff Bezos’s e-commerce revolution and Warren Buffett’s legendary investing style, their wealth-building stories are remarkable examples of vision, execution, philanthropy, and global impact. They influence policies, drive innovation, create jobs, and set trends in markets worldwide. Check the full updated list of the world’s top 10 billionaires influencing markets, industries, and future innovations.Elon Musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. He holds about 12% of Tesla, the electric car pioneer valued at hundreds of billions, and owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, a leader in commercial space technology.Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter (renamed X) for $44 billion further solidified his influence in social media and AI-driven communication. Known for his ambitious projects, such as Neuralink and The Boring Company, Musk’s vision revolves around sustainable energy, interplanetary travel, and integrating AI into human life.Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation, built one of the most successful software companies in the world, specializing in databases and enterprise solutions. He owns 40% of Oracle’s shares, which drive most of his wealth. In addition to technology, Ellison is known for his real estate ventures, most notably his purchase of 98% of Lanai Island in Hawaii for $300 million. A board member at Tesla until 2022, Ellison continues to influence the tech industry with his investments and strategic vision. His lifestyle and property holdings place him among the wealthiest tech moguls globally.Jeff Bezos revolutionized retail through Amazon, transforming it from a humble online bookstore into a global e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2021, Bezos retains significant wealth with a 9% stake in Amazon and ownership of Blue Origin, a space exploration company. Recently, he married Lauren Sánchez, marking a new personal chapter. Bezos also focuses on philanthropy, investing in climate change initiatives and education. His success story is a prime example of how innovation and risk-taking can create unprecedented wealth.Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in 2004, a social media platform that became an integral part of global communication. Now rebranded as Meta Platforms, Zuckerberg’s company is heavily investing in AI and the metaverse—a virtual reality-based internet experience. He owns about 13% of Meta, which drives most of his fortune. Despite facing privacy controversies and regulatory scrutiny, Zuckerberg remains one of the most powerful tech leaders, continuously shaping how billions connect and interact online.Larry Page co-founded Google in 1998 alongside Sergey Brin, creating the most widely used search engine in the world. He served as CEO of Google and later Alphabet (Google’s parent company) before stepping down in 2019. Page remains a controlling shareholder and board member, ensuring continued influence over Alphabet’s direction. He invests in futuristic projects, including flying cars and AI innovations, highlighting his interest in disruptive technology and long-term visions.Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, helped build the foundation of the world’s most powerful search engine and ad-based revenue model. Like Larry Page, he stepped down from executive responsibilities in 2019 but retains significant voting power as a shareholder. Brin’s wealth largely stems from Alphabet’s dominance in search, advertising, and cloud computing. He is also known for investments in artificial intelligence and robotics, emphasizing innovation beyond traditional internet services.Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993, leading it to dominate the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, which powers gaming, AI, and supercomputing. Owning about 3% of Nvidia, Huang’s wealth has skyrocketed due to the AI boom, as Nvidia chips are essential for advanced AI systems worldwide. His leadership and strategic direction have positioned Nvidia as one of the most valuable tech companies, crucial to the growth of AI and cloud computing industries.Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), oversees more than 70 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora. He is the only non-American on this list, representing the luxury fashion and goods sector. Arnault’s five children also play active roles in the family business, ensuring continuity in leadership. His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, diversifying his investments. Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett is known for his modest lifestyle and long-term focus on ethical, disciplined investing.Together, these billionaires not only reflect individual success but also underscore the sectors defining the 21st-century economy—tech, AI, luxury, and finance. Their influence spans across industries, policy, innovation, and philanthropy, shaping the world far beyond just their net worth. Their wealth trajectories also reflect shifting global trends—from digital transformation to AI dominance. As market leaders, their decisions ripple across economies and societies, influencing how we live and work.","Elon musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence.

"To drive sale of EVs, government to clarify they are exempt from 15-year 'end of life' norm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-drive-sale-of-evs-government-to-clarify-they-are-exempt-from-15-year-end-of-life-norm/articleshow/123082925.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","The power ministry will also expedite extending the cafe norms to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.

TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025: Corporate leaders make case for sustainability; call for ground-level shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toi-ecopreneur-honours-2025-corporate-leaders-make-case-for-sustainability-call-for-ground-level-shift/articleshow/123099589.cms,"TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025

At the TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025 held in Delhi on Monday, a thought-provoking panel titled ""From Boardroom to the Road: Integrating Sustainability into India's Growth Strategy"" brought together top industry leaders who outlined how sustainability is no longer a corporate accessory but a foundational growth driver for India’s future.The session featured Anjali Ravi Kumar, chief sustainability officer at Zomato; Ram Kuppuswamy, COO of Hero MotoCorp; Pankaj Verma, chief sustainability officer at Adani Green Energy Limited; and Abhijeet Sinha, program director at National Highways for Electric Vehicles (NHEV). Each panelist detailed how their organisation is embedding sustainability into core operations—beyond CSR—and why doing so is key to long-term success.“We have always embedded sustainability at the heart of our products, services, and customer outreach,” said Kuppuswamy, stressing that Hero MotoCorp has intensified its green efforts over the past decade. “It’s not just a responsibility but a strategic necessity for all stakeholders.”Pankaj Verma echoed this sentiment, highlighting how Adani Green Energy has built its business model around sustainability.“From strategy to execution, we’ve aligned everything with long-term environmental goals. Even our suppliers are improving on these aspects,” he said, adding that their roadmap is reviewed and approved by the Board.Zomato’s Anjali Ravi Kumar noted that Gen Z and younger consumers are driving awareness. “Sustainability matters, but the primary functionality like delivery speed or pricing cannot be compromised. Green practices are now a value addition,” she said. She cited Zomato’s success in offsetting plastic waste: “Each of our food deliveries is 100% plastic neutral. We’ve recycled about 45,000 metric tonnes of plastic. ”Abhijeet Sinha brought a philosophical lens, urging India to develop a model based on indigenous thinking rather than replicating Western frameworks. “India’s green future must emerge from its own wisdom. If we fail to do this, we risk losing our identity,” he warned.The discussion also touched upon urban challenges like the worsening condition of Gurugram. Kuppuswamy pointed out that personal responsibility must go hand-in-hand with systemic reform, while Verma stressed the need to embed sustainability from the planning phase itself. Sinha added that the issue has become a matter of civic and electoral concern.Together, the panellists highlighted that India's green transformation will require both top-down strategies and grassroots participation. As one panellist put it, “Sustainability is not a choice anymore—it is the roadmap.”",Toi ecopreneur honours 2025 held in delhi on monday.

At the TOI Ecopreneur Honours 2025 held in Delhi on Monday, the first panel of the evening ,The Power of the Citizen: Redefining Environmental Activism in the Digital Age, showcased two young changemakers leading by example in the fight against climate change.Prachi Shevgaonkar, founder of Cool The Globe, and Malhar Kalambe, founder of Beach Please India, discussed how their grassroots movements have turned individual responsibility into large-scale environmental impact, using digital tools and community engagement as key drivers.Malhar Kalambe, whose journey began with a simple beach clean-up, highlighted the power of hands-on experience in shaping environmental consciousness. “You can’t learn about the environment in a classroom,” he said. “What we try to do through our community is give young people — even kids as young as six — the opportunity to physically clean beaches and rivers. Only then do they understand how serious the problem really is. ”Over 800 clean-up drives later, his initiative has removed over 8 million kilograms of waste and engaged 4.5 lakh citizens.Kalambe emphasised relatability and creativity on social media as essential tools in motivating youth.“We try to make beach clean-ups cool, something young people can relate to. A single social media post once brought in 6,000 volunteers.”For Shevgaonkar, personal climate anxiety led to innovation. Her journey began with a self-imposed challenge to reduce her carbon footprint by 10%, leading to the creation of Cool The Globe, a mobile app that tracks carbon savings from everyday actions like public transport use or waste segregation.“People often ask: what can one individual do?” she said. “When one lakh users from 150 countries came together, we saved over 7 million kilos of carbon emissions. That’s the power of collective action.” The app features a live global meter and has sparked a worldwide movement, with sustainability ambassadors in over 25 countries.She credited social media for helping create belief among ordinary people that their actions matter. “If we all do our part, miracles can happen,” Shevgaonkar said.The panel highlighted how India’s new wave of eco-champions is turning anxiety into action",Toi ecopreneur honours 2025 showcased two young changemakers leading by example in the fight against climate change.

It was recently revealed that Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott’s Texas mansion is being rebuilt. And this week, it was reported that the construction is officially underway on Dak Prescott’s new mansion in Prosper, Texas.He tore down his multi-million-dollar estate last month a few months ago as Prescott wanted something more contemporary and intimate. Some new photos were procured by a tabloid platform recently which offers a close-up look at the construction. Prescott’s old mansion was torn down, and the new concept of the home relies on clean lines and compartmentalised segments.Photos show two structures already in place on the lot, and the structure looks like it is shaping up to be a luxury apartment, which is at least two storeys highs. Prescott first knocked down his original house in October 2024, which makes sense because his family is growing and it’s evident that he will need a bigger space.He tore the house down shortly after he signed his contract with the Cowboys. The Dallas Cowboys signed quarterback Dak Prescott to a four-year, $240 million contract extension in September 2024; the contract also made him the highest-paid player in the NFL at the time, and since Prescott will be with the Cowboys through the 2028 season, it makes sense for him to spend on a bigger home.The Dallas Cowboys quarterback celebrated his engagement to Sarah Jane Ramos earlier this year, and Sarah gave birth to their second daughter, Aurora Rayne, on May 22.“Thank You, God! Welcome, Aurora Rayne! May 22, 2025. God is Great,” Prescott wrote on Instagram upon the arrival of her second daughter.","Dak prescott tore down his mansion in prosper, texas last month.

In Pokémon Go, to hunt a shiny variant of a Pokémon is always exciting. The rare variant of Swirlix isn’t an exception. With trainers having boosted odds of catching one during special events, one has a better shot at adding this pastel candy-colored sweet Pokémon variant to one’s collection.

But during the “Delightful Days Sweet Swarm event,” running between August 3, 2025, and August 6, 2025 (11:59 PM), the Pokémon’s shiny rate increases. The best way to encounter it would be to complete Timed Pokémon GO Research tasks and Field research. It will reward players with Swirlix encounters.You can even get a Shiny Swirlix as research rewards.Lure Modules even play a key role here. To activate them at PokéStops during the event, running time will attract Swirlix for a complete hour, not 30 minutes.As shiny odds will remain high during the period, grinding research tasks and using Lures will maximize chances of finding the brown-and-tanned variant of Swirlix.While Swirlix shiny versions, just like any other shiny Pokemon, does not come with actual advantage over its standard counterparts. But its unique color makes it a standout addition.Swirlix evolution into Slurpuff is not as simple as collecting candy.

As both conditions will be met, a simple Evolve button click will unlock the Pokémon in the menu.Catch as many Swirlix as possible. Later, transfer extras to Professor Willow.If you caught Shiny Swirlix, a similar rule applies. To evolve, it will turn it into a shiny Slurpuff.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress michelle pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that apeel, a food technology company backed by bill gates, was contaminating organic produce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123037889,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54030,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis explains ai in healthcare can replace doctors but not nurses.

Foxconn sells Lordstown plant for $88 million but keeps EV production running while expanding US growth plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/foxconn-sells-lordstown-plant-for-88-million-but-keeps-ev-production-running-while-expanding-us-growth-plans/articleshow/123094141.cms,"Source: Reuters and Automotive News

Foxconn sells Lordstown plant while boosting US EV plans



Why Foxconn chose Crescent Dune as existing partner for its Lordstown sale



Foxconn continues EV production at Lordstown after $88 million sale



Foxconn expands US footprint with focus on EVs and advanced manufacturing



Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn (2317.TW) has finalised the sale of its former Lordstown, Ohio factory for $88 million, as revealed in recent regulatory filings. The facility’s new owner, Crescent Dune LLC, has been described by Foxconn as an ‘existing business partner’, indicating a continued strategic relationship. Despite the transfer of ownership, Foxconn confirmed it will remain an occupant of the plant, ensuring ongoing production and operations remain unaffected. The company further announced plans to reinvest the sale proceeds into US-based initiatives, reinforcing its commitment to building a long-term industrial and manufacturing presence in the United States. The deal reflects Foxconn’s evolving strategy to optimise assets while supporting its growth in electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing sectors.The Lordstown site has a long history in American automotive manufacturing. It previously belonged to Lordstown Motors Corp, an electric vehicle startup that acquired the property from General Motors after GM closed its plant there in 2019. Lordstown Motors aimed to revive the region’s auto industry with its electric pickup truck program. However, due to financial struggles, production delays, and eventual bankruptcy, Lordstown Motors sold the facility to Foxconn in 2022 for $230 million as reported by Reuters.For Foxconn, known globally for assembling consumer electronics like the iPhone, the acquisition marked its entry into electric vehicle manufacturing—a strategic move to diversify beyond electronics and capitalise on the growing EV market.The buyer, Crescent Dune LLC, is described by Foxconn as an ‘existing business partner’, but little is publicly known about its operations or specific business model. By transferring ownership to a trusted partner while remaining a tenant, Foxconn benefits from the facility without bearing the long-term cost of ownership.This sale-and-leaseback arrangement is common in manufacturing, allowing companies to unlock capital tied up in real estate and redirect it into core business expansion. For Foxconn, this means focusing funds on scaling electric vehicle production, research, and emerging US manufacturing projects.Despite the ownership change, Foxconn emphasised that its current workforce and operations will remain intact. The company will continue using the facility to support electric vehicle programs, component manufacturing, and advanced production initiatives. This approach minimises operational disruption and ensures that the strategic objectives behind the initial Lordstown acquisition remain in place.At first glance, the difference between the $230 million purchase price in 2022 and the $88 million sale price may raise eyebrows. However, this is part of a long-term financial and operational restructuring strategy. By selling the real estate and reinvesting in its high-growth business segments, Foxconn can focus resources on innovation, partnerships with EV startups, and digital manufacturing infrastructure instead of tying capital in physical property ownership.Lordstown and surrounding areas have faced economic turbulence since General Motors shuttered operations, leading to job losses and economic uncertainty. The arrival of Foxconn initially generated optimism, particularly for skilled labor and EV industry growth. With the company continuing operations at the same facility, the local economy may still benefit from jobs and advanced manufacturing expertise. Additionally, partnerships like these often attract ancillary businesses and encourage regional supply chain growth.Foxconn has long signalled plans to expand its US footprint beyond electronics. Its entry into electric vehicles, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure manufacturing demonstrates a strategic shift toward next-generation industries. By divesting real estate while remaining operational, Foxconn is showing a preference for flexibility and scalability in its US strategy.The move aligns with Foxconn’s collaborations with EV startups and established automakers, leveraging its experience in high-volume, precision manufacturing to serve one of the world’s fastest-growing industries.","Foxconn has finalised the sale of its former lordstown, ohio factory for $88 million.

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI

As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation. Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller. Multiple developers working on the project have reportedly experienced similar “disorientation” during early testing phases, describing the model as exhibiting behavior that borders on emergent autonomy.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. The ability to imitate nuanced human emotion and logic has reportedly reached new heights in GPT-5—blurring the line between machine and mind even further. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insight.Altman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","Openai ceo sam altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of gpt-5, the newest and most powerful version of chatgpt.

Who is Andrew Tulloch? Former OpenAI engineer and Mira Murati’s co-founder who rejected a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-andrew-tulloch-former-openai-engineer-and-mira-muratis-co-founder-who-rejected-a-1-5-billion-offer-from-mark-zuckerberg/articleshow/123072312.cms,"Andrew Tulloch: From Wall Street to the frontier of AI

Mark Zuckerberg’s offer and Tulloch’s viral rejection





Andrew Tulloch, an Australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from Mark Zuckerberg to rejoin Meta. A former OpenAI engineer, Tulloch is now the co-founder of Thinking Machines Lab alongside ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati. The AI startup, still in its early stages, is already valued at $12 billion. Tulloch’s decision to decline Zuckerberg’s aggressive recruitment attempt reflects a broader trend of top AI talent prioritizing independence, mission-driven work, and long-term impact over staggering financial packages.Tulloch’s journey began at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with first-class honours and a University Medal in mathematics. He later earned a Master’s in Mathematical Statistics from Cambridge and pursued a PhD at UC Berkeley. Tulloch worked at Meta (then Facebook) from 2012 to 2023, contributing to machine learning systems and the development of PyTorch. He joined OpenAI in 2023, focusing on GPT-4 pretraining and reasoning models, before co-founding Thinking Machines Lab in early 2025. Unlike many AI engineers who stay within big tech, Tulloch has consistently sought out roles where he can shape core AI architecture rather than optimize existing systems.Co-founded with Mira Murati, Thinking Machines Lab is focused on building AI systems that are safer, interpretable, and customizable—going beyond traditional chatbot interfaces. The startup, though yet to release a product, has secured a $2 billion seed round with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia, AMD, and Google Cloud. Its ambition and leadership have made it a top target for recruitment, especially from Zuckerberg's new ""superintelligence"" division at Meta. Industry insiders say the startup has quietly attracted talent from DeepMind, Anthropic, and OpenAI—further signaling that it may become a major challenger in the foundation model race.According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally tried to lure Tulloch back to Meta with a six-year offer worth up to $1.5 billion, contingent on bonuses and stock performance. Tulloch declined, joining other Thinking Machines Lab co-founders in resisting Meta’s poaching attempts. The bold rejection has gone viral, with Tulloch’s LinkedIn profile celebrated for charting a rare career driven by principles rather than payouts. Meta later disputed the exact terms of the offer but confirmed outreach efforts were made.","Andrew tulloch, an australian computer scientist and machine learning expert, has made headlines after turning down a $1.5 billion offer from mark zuckerberg to rejoin meta.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

The effective US tariff rate on Indian goods jumped to 20.7 per cent in 2025 from just 2.4 per cent in 2024, Fitch Ratings said in its latest assessment.Fitch reported, quoted by ET, noted that the overall US effective tariff rate stands at 17 per cent- about 8 percentage points lower than the estimate made on April 3 when reciprocal tariffs were initially declared. It explained, “The US tariff rate of 17 per cent reflects a 15 per cent tariff rate on EU goods, including auto and auto parts, and higher tariffs for major trading partners Brazil, Taiwan, India and Switzerland.”Also read: How India, China may not come to Trump’s rescue to get Putin to stop Russia-Ukraine war The revised numbers come days after US President Donald Trump formally announced a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, alongside a separate, undefined ""penalty"" linked to India’s ongoing energy trade with Russia.As the trade environment becomes increasingly uncertain, economists are trimming their growth expectations for India. Goldman Sachs has cut its growth projection for 2025 to 6.5 per cent and for 2026 to 6.4 per cent, citing the tariff surge as a key driver of the revision. “In our view, some of these tariffs are likely to be negotiated lower over time, and further downside risk to the growth trajectory mainly emanates from the uncertainty,” the investment bank said. HDFC Bank , in its own analysis, estimated that the new US tariffs could reduce India’s GDP growth by 20 to 25 basis points.Christian de Guzman, senior vice president at Moody’s Ratings, said the long-term effects could weigh on India’s ambitions to become a major manufacturing hub. “Curtailed access to the largest economy globally diminishes prospects for India’s ambitions to develop its manufacturing sector, particularly in higher value-added sectors such as electronics,” he said, as quoted by ET.Despite the rising headwinds, Moody’s maintains a relatively positive outlook on India’s broader economic stability. “India’s economy is expected to remain resilient as it is less trade-reliant than other large economies in the Asia-Pacific,” de Guzman added.",The effective us tariff rate on indian goods jumped to 20.7% in 2025 from just 2.4% in 2024.

Then, she uses red paint to change the word “genes” to “jeans” and says in a voiceover: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color.My jeans are blue.”The tagline read “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans” plays on the word “genes,” which many critics found problematic.Some accused the campaign of being overly sexualised and promoting outdated beauty standards, pointing to the focus on Sweeney’s blonde hair, blue eyes, and slim physique.Others went further, interpreting the wordplay as an unintended reference to eugenics, a theory historically used to promote racial superiority.Earlier on Friday, American Eagle in response issued a statement on Instagram saying the campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The brand emphasised that their message celebrates confidence and individuality, saying, “Great jeans look good on everyone.”While critics debated the ad’s deeper implications, marketing experts noted that the attention, positive or negative has certainly kept both Sweeney and American Eagle in the spotlight.","""euphoria"" star sydney sweeney is once again trending online, this time for her impressive skills at the shooting range.

"Low battery, higher prices? California targets AI-driven pricing; bill to ban use of phone data for secret hikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/low-battery-higher-prices-california-targets-ai-driven-pricing-bill-to-ban-use-of-phone-data-for-secret-hikes/articleshow/123103926.cms,"Senator Aisha Wahab (Image credits: X @SenAishaWahab)





A California lawmaker is leading a bold push to ban companies from using personal data collected from phones, laptops, and other devices to secretly hike prices- an AI-driven tactic increasingly under fire from consumer advocates and lawmakers alike.Senator Aisha Wahab, a Democrat from Fremont, has introduced legislation that would prohibit businesses from using AI to adjust prices based on information stored on customers’ phones, laptops, or other hardware.The bill, which cleared the state senate in May, is now being considered in the Assembly. It is one of 30 AI-related measures introduced by the Legislature this year.Wahab cited findings from Consumer Watchdog showing that ride-hailing apps charged more to riders with low phone batteries. Another investigation by ProPublica found the test prep company Princeton Review offered more expensive SAT tutoring to users in ZIP codes with high Asian populations.“Our devices are being weaponised against us in order for large corporations to increase profits, and it has to stop,” Wahab said during an Assembly committee hearing in July.Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft have denied unfair pricing practices. Business groups, including the California chamber of commerce, and some Republican legislators are pushing back on the bill.“This overregulation is impeding how we do business and how people want to do business,” said Assemblymember Diane Dixon, a Republican from Newport Beach. “I just believe that the market resolves these issues.”","Senator aisha wahab, a democrat from fremont, has introduced legislation that would prohibit businesses from using ai to adjust prices.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.
