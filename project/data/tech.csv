Don’t Overprice Products, Deliver On Time: Gen

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns that Indian arms companies were failing to deliver emergency procurements on time and that some of them were even inflating the extent of indigenous content in their products, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"".""Defence reforms are not a one-way street. (Domestic) industries will have to be truthful about their indigenous capabilities to us. You cannot leave us in the lurch. When you sign a contract and don't deliver in that particular time frame, it is a capability that is being lost,"" CDS said at a USI seminar on Friday. CDS said Army had told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames during 5th and 6th phases of the emergency procurements mechanism. tnnCDS said ""most"" of the Indian companies have ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.""This is unacceptable,"" he said. The EP mechanism empowers the armed forces to fast-track contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore that have to be executed within a year, instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.After EP-5 last year, which was reserved exclusively for domestic companies, the defence ministry had approved EP-6.This came following the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.It will help the Army, Indian Air Force and Navy to build as well as replenish their stockpiles of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition, through both foreign and domestic sources.Amid allegations that many domestic companies are merely assembling systems after importing them, instead of manufacturing them, Gen Anil Chauhan said, ""A lot of industries say this (a product) is 70% indigenous, but actually, if you find out, it is not. You have to be truthful about this. Because it is related to matters of security.""The Chief of Defence Staff also criticised the overpricing of weapon systems and platforms.""You will have to be cost-competitive. Cost competitiveness is not for selling to the Indian armed forces. You have to be cost-competitive to compete in the foreign market. You can't have products which are overpriced,"" Gen Chauhan said.","Cds anil chauhan issues red line to defence industry, warns against delays and overpromising.

Mahe-Class: Navy to commission its first indigenous shallow water anti-submarine warfare vessel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahe-class-navy-to-commission-its-first-indigenous-shallow-water-anti-submarine-warfare-vessel/articleshow/125364302.cms,"CDS General Anil Chauhan Highlights Inter-Service Jointness And Integration In Op Sindoor

The Indian Navy is set to achieve a new milestone in its drive toward self-reliance with the commissioning of INS Mahe, the first of the Mahe-class Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Crafts (ASW-SWCs). The vessel will be officially inducted at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai on November 24, marking a significant step forward in India’s indigenous shipbuilding capabilities.Built by Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), Kochi, INS Mahe is a key symbol of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, reflecting the Navy’s sustained push for homegrown defence technologies. Designed and constructed entirely in India, the vessel demonstrates the nation’s growing expertise in modern naval architecture, combat systems, and platform integration.Compact yet formidable, Mahe blends agility, endurance, and cutting-edge technology—qualities essential for operations in shallow waters and coastal zones. Equipped with advanced sonar, radar, and weapons systems, the ship is designed for anti-submarine warfare, coastal patrols, underwater surveillance, low-intensity maritime operations (LIMO), and mine-laying missions. Its primary role will be to safeguard India’s critical maritime approaches and counter underwater threats in littoral regions.According to the Ministry of Defence, Mahe was delivered to the Indian Navy on October 23, 2025, ahead of its commissioning. At approximately 78 metres in length and displacing around 1,100 tons, the platform integrates torpedo systems and multifunctional anti-submarine rockets, giving it significant capability for underwater combat and area denial.With over 80 percent indigenous content, the Mahe-class ships represent a major leap in India’s quest for self-reliance in naval ship design and production. The vessel’s crest features the Urumi—the flexible sword of Kalarippayattu—symbolizing the same agility, precision, and lethal grace that define the ship’s operational character.Named after the historic coastal town of Mahe on the Malabar Coast, INS Mahe heralds the arrival of a new generation of Indian-built shallow-water combatants—sleek, swift, and resolutely Indian. Seven more ships of this class will follow, further bolstering the Navy’s capabilities in coastal defence and anti-submarine warfare.","Ins mahe is the first of the mahe-class anti-submarine warfare shallow water crafts (asw-swcs) the vessel will be officially inducted at the naval dockyard in mumbai on november 24.

Claims of AI-made apology fuel new backlash against Kayla Nicole

Kayla Nicole seems to never escape the storm that follows her name online. The former longtime girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is once again pulled into a new wave of backlash, and this time the conversation is not only about what she said years ago. It is also about how she chose to respond now. What began as a resurfacing of decade-old tweets has turned into a much louder debate about authenticity, accountability, and the growing suspicion around the use of artificial intelligence in public apologies.The SportsRush reported that some online users accused Nicole of using ChatGPT or another AI tool to craft her apology for her old offensive tweets. That accusation has created a second controversy, with people now questioning whether her regret was genuine or written by a machine.The situation first ignited when users dug up tweets Kayla Nicole posted between 2010 and 2014, long before she became a public figure. Those posts contained racial remarks, homophobic language, and stereotypes aimed at Asian and Indian communities. As screenshots began circulating at high speed across social media, Nicole took down her X account and later addressed the issue on Instagram. In her statement, she wrote that she was ""ashamed"" of her past language and stressed that her current beliefs ""are rooted in love, respect, and empathy.Her apology was expected to settle the matter, but instead it sparked more frustration. Some users copied her message into online AI-detection tools, which labeled it as “100% AI-generated.” According to The SportsRush, this result encouraged critics to argue that Nicole relied on ChatGPT to form her apology. The allegation quickly became louder than the apology itself as many claimed the tone felt calculated rather than heartfelt.For some people, the possibility of an AI-written apology suggested that she did not hold true remorse. They viewed it as an attempt to escape accountability through polished language.Others pushed back, saying that AI accusations felt like an unnecessary distraction. They argued that using detection tools to delegitimize her apology only added noise to an already tense situation. Instead, they believe that the focus should remain on acknowledging harm, understanding growth, and recognizing that, people can evolve from the mistakes they made in their past.","Travis kelce’s ex faces new scrutiny as fans claim her heartfelt apology shows signs of ai-generated scripting.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in texas through 2027.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella quotes Bill Gates to explain what makes a true AI platform; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-quotes-bill-gates-to-explain-what-makes-a-true-ai-platform-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/125362427.cms,"

Nadella says Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI is an example of zero-sum mindset industry





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post explaining what he believes defines a real artificial intelligence (AI) platform — and he turned to a well-known idea from Bill Gates to make his point. In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), Nadella said tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them, not just for the companies that make the technology. He cited Bill Gates to emphasize the same: “A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to Nadella's post with a facepalm emoji.Nadella said this idea matters even more during the current AI boom, where many firms risk giving away too much of their own value to big tech platforms. “The real question is how to empower every company out there to build their own AI-native capabilities,” he wrote.Nadella pointed to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI as an example of how a “positive-sum” approach can work. “Our investment helped them scale; their research accelerated our own innovation,” he said, adding that both companies benefited by improving each other’s products and infrastructure.Nadella also highlighted the companies involved in building Microsoft’s new AI infrastructure. He said the world’s first “AI superfactory” — recently announced by Microsoft and OpenAI — was developed using learnings from three generations of AI supercomputers and through close collaboration with Nvidia.He added that Microsoft has now integrated AMD chips as well, giving startups and enterprises more options for training and running their AI models.The Microsoft CEO said the real test of the AI era will not be tech valuations but whether industries like healthcare, manufacturing, education and agriculture see real-world gains. “When a pharma company uses AI to bring a new therapy to market in one year instead of twelve… that’s when we’ll know the system is working,” he said.He urged companies to avoid “zero-sum thinking” and warned them to protect their own data and value instead of relying solely on partnerships that may turn “extractive” over time.Nadella concluded by saying the industry has an opportunity to ensure AI benefits are widely spread — a lesson, he noted, that comes from past waves of technology where some sectors, like local media, were left behind.",Satya nadella says tech companies should focus on building ai systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them.

Competing with SpaceX's dominance









Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.",Blue origin’s second-try success marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha ceo nithin kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following sebi’s recent advisory on digital gold. ‘most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there's not much you can do,’ wrote kamath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125291255,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has declared that the next decade represents a period of immense historical consequence, arguing that the coming 10 years will have a greater determination over the next 100 years than any prior era due to the arrival of non-human intelligence, or artificial intelligence (AI). Schmidt compared the emergence of AI to fundamental inventions in human history, such as electricity or the invention of fire, stressing its revolutionary power.“We are fortunate to be living in a time of great historical consequence,” Schmidt said in a virtual interview recently. He emphasised that the new AI tools are very powerful because they can “equal and, in some cases, surpass human intelligence,"" which is the source of societal growth and innovation.""The countries and companies that embrace this non-human intelligence correctly and aggressively will be the big winners,"" Schmidt stated.Conversely, he warned that companies and countries that slow their adoption or allow others to lead will fall behind, as economic growth and leadership are derived from the application of intelligence to solve new problems.“And the companies and countries that slow or let other people do it, they will lose because the source of excellence, the source of leadership, the source of growth, the source of everything, the source of innovation…everything..ofeconomic growth comes from the application of intelligence to discover new things to solve new problems,” he said.Schmidt also sounded a major geopolitical alarm, naming the potential global dominance of Chinese open-source AI models as one of his “biggest fears” for the future of the technology.Speaking on the Moonshots podcast this week, Schmidt highlighted a growing divergence in the global AI landscape:US Models: Primarily closed-source and costly.Chinese Models: Largely open-source and free.“The geopolitical issue there, of course, is that open source is free and the closed source models are not free,” Schmidt explained.","Schmidt warns of chinese open-source dominance of ai.

The hearing has been scheduled for 18 November 2025. Over the past several months, NITES has received a large number of complaints from TCS employees across various locations regarding abrupt terminations, forced resignations, denial of statutory dues, and coercive employment practices. After reviewing the grievances and supporting documents, NITES assisted the affected employees in filing formal complaints before the competent authority.The initiation of proceedings by the Labour Commissioner reinforces that every employer is legally bound to follow due process and cannot act in violation of labour laws,"" said TCS in its post.NITES urged any current or former worker who believes that they faced wrongful removal or denial of dues to file formal complaints, adding that it will support affected staff in preparing submissions and seeking available remedies. ""Employees who have faced similar issues are encouraged to come forward and assert their rights. If you have experienced wrongful termination, forced resignation, non-payment of dues, or any form of pressure or unfair treatment, you have legal protections available. Raising your grievance formally is an important step toward ensuring accountability and safeguarding your employment rights. NITES remains committed to supporting IT and ITES employees who require guidance or assistance in filing complaints or understanding available legal remedies,"" the post addes.At the company's recent earnings call, TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal, said that the company is “not chasing a target” with respect to its headcount reduction. Responding to a question on whether the quantum of the headcount reduction seen during the July-September period will continue in the subsequent quarter, chief human resources officer Kunnumal said the company will continue to evaluate everyone.“The 20,000 net headcount decline is due to voluntary and involuntary attrition… we don't have a target… We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done,” Kunnuamal said. Mid and senior-level staff members unable to find the right role based on their seniority will be released “with a lot of care”, he said.Meanwhile, the company’s net headcount reduced by nearly 20,000 during the previous quarter. Its attrition rate moved to 13.3% during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up from 12.3% in the year-ago period, but less than 13.8% in the first quarter. Total headcount as of September-end stood at 593,314.","The labour commissioner office in pune has summoned tata consultancy services (tcs) in matters filed by the it industry employees union, nascent information technology employees senate (nites) in its complaint, nites alleged unlawful terminations and layoffs by tcs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125353743,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-15430,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’



""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIl' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. Search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey, gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

Karl-Anthony Towns celebrates the moment, then delivers a dominant on-court performance







Karl-Anthony Towns’ 30th birthday turned into one of the most emotional moments of the NBA week, thanks to a surprise from Jordyn Woods that reached far beyond a simple celebration. The New York Knicks star entered the weekend expecting a routine milestone, but Woods delivered something rooted in memory and love. Her gift immediately captured NBA fans, turning a private moment into a story that blended nostalgia, family, and an athlete stepping into a new decade with gratitude.Woods has long been visible in Towns’ orbit, often supporting him publicly and even confronting critics who mocked him.

The moment also landed during one of Towns’ hottest stretches of the season.Jordyn Woods shared on Instagram that the idea came from a summer conversation about dream cars. What started casually quickly turned emotional when Towns told her, not about luxury models or rare collectibles, but the car his mother once drove.Woods went on a mission to make his dream a reality, who wrote, ""During the summer Karl asked me if I could drive any car for a day which one would it be.. I answered and his response was ‘I wouldn’t pick anything crazy, I just really loved my mom’s car she had when I was a kid. ’ So I went on a mission these past months to find the car, shipped it across the country, got it fixed up and was able to surprise him with it today for his 30th!""She paired the post with photos of Towns as a child sitting in the original car, along with a reaction video that instantly went viral. In the clip, a stunned Towns says, ""This is so fire, this is the best thing ever."" The car, restored to match his mother’s model, triggered an overwhelming wave of fan reactions. Olympic gymnast Suni Lee commented with crying emojis.The celebration continued with Knicks teammates Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges joining a small gathering, complete with a trading card–themed cake crafted by a New York Black-owned bakery. Towns later wrote, “Another year of blessings, grateful for it all,” as he reflected on the weekend.Woods’ gesture offered him a moment of grounding in the middle of a demanding season. It honored his mother, strengthened a five-year relationship, and reminded fans of the person behind the star.Also Read: ‘I feel bad for…’ — LeBron James’ return sparks immediate concern for one Lakers star as Shaquille O’Neal issues bombshell caution","Karl-anthony towns' 30th birthday turned into one of the most emotional moments of the nba week.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",Openai's chatbot violated german copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician herbert groenemeyer and others.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.",Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.
