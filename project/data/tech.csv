NEW DELHI: Advertisements on e-commerce platforms that claim certain body lotions can whiten your skin in just minutes always sounded fictitious. What you doubted has turned out to be true. In three recent cases, companies have admitted to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) that these were exaggerations and they resorted to such claims of ""unique selling point (USP)"" to just come up on e-commerce platforms.In orders passed by the CCPA in Feb against four companies selling whitening creams and body lotion, including the three which cited USP, the consumer watchdog has recorded how the companies failed to substantiate their claims. They withdrew their advertisements from e-commerce platforms after the authority issued notices to them.In all these cases, investigations by the Bureau of Indian Standards confirmed that the companies failed to provide any scientific validation to their claims or any proof to support their claims. It has imposed fines on these entities and instructed them not to make such unverified and unsubstantiated claims.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula. The stakes increase as you move closer to the mid- to endgame. Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

Rocket Mortgage is acquiring competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion, shortly after its acquisition of real estate listing company Redfin.The merger will create a combined entity handling one in every six mortgages in the US, adding nearly 7 million new clients to Rocket’s portfolio. This strategic move is expected to increase loan volumes and lower customer acquisition costs, news agency AP reported.Jay Bray, Chairman and CEO of Mr. Cooper, who will become President and CEO of Rocket Mortgage, stated, “By combining Mr. Cooper and Rocket, we will form the strongest mortgage company in the industry, offering an end-to-end homeownership experience backed by leading technology and grounded in customer care.”The US housing market has been in a slump, with soaring mortgage rates and high prices putting homeownership out of reach for many. Companies like Rocket are responding by building a more comprehensive, one-stop experience for potential homebuyers.Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Cooper shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 11 Rocket shares for each share of Mr. Cooper common stock. Upon completion, Rocket shareholders will own approximately 75% of the combined company, while Mr. Cooper stockholders will own 25%. The combined company’s board will consist of 11 members, with nine from Rocket and two from Mr. Cooper.Earlier this month, Rocket also announced its acquisition of Redfin in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Redfin, founded in 2004, offers over 1 million for-sale and rental listings on its platform.The National Association of Realtors reported a 4.2% increase in existing home sales in February, partly driven by easing mortgage rates and more properties available on the market.

Create Ghibli-style Eid images using AI



Step 1: Decide on the Eid scene you want to create

1. Crescent moon and starry night

The sighting of the Shawwal crescent moon marks the beginning of Eid.

You can generate an image featuring a glowing crescent moon in a deep blue sky, with lanterns or a peaceful village below.

2. Family gatherings

Depict a warm, cozy indoor scene where family members are dressed in traditional Eid attire, sharing a meal or exchanging gifts.

Add details like a decorated Eid table with traditional dishes like biryani, kebabs, sweets, and tea.

3. Eid prayer at a grand mosque

Illustrate a majestic mosque with glowing lights and people gathering for prayer.

Include soft sunlight filtering through the clouds, creating a peaceful and spiritual effect.

4. Children receiving Eidi

Create an image of children joyfully receiving Eidi (money or gifts) from elders.

You can add playful elements like balloons, sweets, and bright festival decorations.

5. A Ghibli-style Eid feast

Ghibli movies are famous for their detailed food illustrations, so you can generate a delicious Eid feast with steaming plates of traditional dishes, tea, and desserts.

Step 2: Generate the Ghibli-Style Eid image using AI

Option 1: Generate an image from a text prompt

Open an AI art generation tool that supports Ghibli-style rendering.

Enter a detailed prompt describing your Eid scene. Example prompt: ""A warm and colorful Ghibli-style illustration of a family celebrating Eid in a cozy room, sharing food, with soft lighting and a decorated table. The atmosphere is peaceful and magical.""

Adjust settings such as color tones, lighting, and artistic details to match the Ghibli aesthetic.

Generate the image and refine it if necessary.

Option 2: Transform an existing photo into Ghibli style

Upload a personal Eid photo to an AI-powered image transformation tool.

Apply a Ghibli-style filter or enhancement, adjusting lighting, softness, and colors to mimic hand-drawn art.

Fine-tune the details by adding warm tones, soft shadows, and watercolor-like textures.

Save the final image in high resolution.

Step 3: Enhance and personalize your image

1. Adjust colours and lighting

Ghibli films have a signature soft glow with warm and pastel tones.

Increase brightness and saturation to make the image more vibrant.

Add a slight blur or watercolor effect to give it a hand-painted look.

2. Add text and Eid greetings

Overlay your image with festive Eid messages such as: ""Eid Mubarak! Wishing you love, peace, and happiness."" ""May this Eid bring joy and prosperity to you and your family!""



3. Insert extra details

Add stars, lanterns, or Islamic geometric patterns to the background.

If it’s a food-related scene, include steam rising from dishes for an animated effect.

If it’s a mosque scene, enhance the glowing lights and crescent moon reflection.

Step 4: Share your Ghibli-style Eid image with family and friends

1. Send as a digital Eid greeting card

2. Post on social media

Upload your artwork to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or X (Twitter).

Use festive hashtags like #EidMubarak, #GhibliEid, #EidArt, #AIArt to connect with others.

Some users are also turning their Eid images into short animated GIFs or reels.

3. Print and gift the artwork (optional)

A history of delays

What travellers need to know

American travellers are in a last-minute rush to secure a Real ID-compliant driver’s licence or identification card as the deadline is fast approaching. After the deadline, 7 May, individuals flying domestically will need either a Real ID, a passport, or another approved form of identification to board a plane.Despite previous delays to enforcement, federal officials insisted that this time, the deadline is firm. In response, department of motor vehicles (DMV) offices across the country are seeing an unprecedented surge in demand, forcing them to extend operating hours and add hundreds of new appointment slots.However, the influx of applicants has led to hours-long queues stretching around buildings in states such as Tennessee and Pennsylvania.With long wait times at DMV locations, many Americans turned to social media to vent their frustrations and exchange tips on where to find the shortest queues.One Facebook user from New Jersey complained, “The whole state is booked!” while another user on Reddit asked, “What are my options?” after struggling to find a way to fly their son home after his university term.Those unable to secure appointments until the summer have resorted to posting in local online groups, hoping for cancellations that would allow them to move up their appointments.Meanwhile, authorities in Miami-Dade County have uncovered a network of scalpers booking free DMV slots and reselling them for profit, MSN news reported.According to the transportation security administration (TSA), around one in five travellers currently passing through US airports do not have a Real ID or another compliant form of identification. This is despite the requirement having been in the pipeline for decades and states issuing Real IDs since the 2010s.Many travellers have put off obtaining a Real ID due to repeated deadline extensions. The US government postponed the requirement three times, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading some to assume it would be delayed once again.Adding to the confusion, some states, such as California and New York, continue to issue both standard licences and Real IDs, meaning many people did not upgrade their IDs when renewing. Mixed messaging from different authorities has further complicated matters.Airports now display signs urging passengers to get “Real ID ready,” and the department of homeland security’s website featured a countdown timer for the deadline. However, states overwhelmed by demand have tried to ease concerns. The Illinois secretary of state’s website reassures residents with the message, “Don’t Rush the Date. Real ID Can Wait.”Illinois has responded to the surge by introducing “DMV Real ID Saturdays” and opening a dedicated walk-in centre in Chicago. Yet, the state government reminded residents that they can still travel with a valid US passport.The percentage of Real ID-compliant licences varies greatly by state. Texas, which exclusively issues Real id-compliant driver’s licences, boasts a 98% compliance rate, according to the Texas department of public safety.Pennsylvania, however, offered multiple types of licences and has an opt-in rate of just 25.6% for Real IDs, according to the state’s transportation department. In response to rising demand, Pennsylvania extended DMV hours on select Mondays.From 7 May, all travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.Real IDs are easily identifiable by a special marking at the top of the card, often a gold star.

The first orbital rocket launch from mainland Europe ended in failure Sunday, when the vehicle exploded seconds after lift-off, hampering the continent's aspirations in the commercial space sector.Footage showed the Spectrum rocket, built by German company Isar Aerospace , emitting smoke from its sides before plummeting to Earth with a fiery explosion shortly after departing Norway's Andoya Spaceport in the Arctic region.These rockets are specifically engineered to transport payloads like satellites into or beyond Earth's orbital zone.This attempt marked the first-ever orbital vehicle launch from European soil, excluding Russia, and and Europe's first financed almost exclusively by the private sector.Weather conditions had caused multiple launch delays, and Isar Aerospace had maintained modest expectations. ""Every second we fly is good, because we collect data and experience. Thirty seconds would already be a great success,"" said Daniel Metzler, the company's co-founder and chief executive, prior to the launch, as reported by AFP.""We do not expect to reach orbit with this test. In fact, no company has yet managed to put its first orbital launch vehicle into orbit,"" he added.The test flight involved a 28-metre (92-foot), two-stage rocket without any payload.Prior to this in 2023, Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit conducted Europe's first orbital launch attempt. The mission, which involved launching a rocket from a Boeing 747 over southwest England, failed and subsequently led to the company's closure.","Europe orbital rocket crash video shows explosion seconds after lift-off.

Auto settlement claims

UPI withdrawals for PF members

The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”","The employees provident fund organisation ( epfo ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (asac) limit, raising it five times from rs 1 lakh to rs 5 lakh.
