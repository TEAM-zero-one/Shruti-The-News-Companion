Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift: A Love Story That Felt Different from the Start



Stealing Money + Jason Kelce | The Steam Room

From the moment Travis Kelce started spending time with Taylor Swift , his brother Jason Kelce could sense something truly special. Recalling his initial reaction on TNT’s ""Steam Room,"" Jason admitted his amazement, saying, “Are you kidding me? You’re hanging out with Taylor Swift? Like, that’s insane. That’s awesome for you.” But what stood out to Jason wasn't just the celebrity connection; it was how his brother talked about Taylor from the very beginning. According to Jason, “You could tell how much he really, really liked her right from the get-go.”Unlike the typical whirlwind romances often seen in the public eye, Travis and Taylor’s relationship was marked by an authentic connection that Jason noticed early on. “You know, you meet a lot of people. I think this felt different,” Jason shared. It wasn’t just about the star power or fame; it was about how Travis genuinely admired and respected Taylor from the start. This authenticity made Jason realize the seriousness of their relationship.Reflecting on how their bond impacted his younger brother, Jason noted, “The level of their romance was very eye-opening.” It was evident that Taylor played an important role not just as a partner but also as a positive influence on Travis’s life. Their nearly two-year relationship has been more than just a headline-grabbing affair—it has contributed to Travis’s personal growth and maturity.During an appearance on the “Fitz & Whit” podcast, Jason shared insights into how Taylor’s presence has influenced Travis’s journey. He described his brother as someone who had always embraced his youthful spirit, comparing him to “Peter Pan” and “the Lost Boys.” Yet, Jason acknowledged a noticeable change, admitting, “Trav, he is growing up. He’s still, though, got that youthful enthusiasm.” This transformation, according to Jason, is one of the reasons why Travis is so beloved by his teammates and fans alike.Taylor’s influence seems to have grounded Travis, helping him find a balance between his playful nature and a newfound sense of responsibility. The couple’s romance continues to flourish, as they were recently seen together at the 2025 Super Bowl. Despite the Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, their bond remains unshaken. However, reports suggest that they are planning to take some time off to relax and recharge after a hectic NFL season.Also Read: Joe Burrow’s recent post raises eyebrows and leaves fans “passing out” and ""running"" to his social media While the public may see less of them in the coming months, it’s clear that their relationship is built on a foundation of genuine affection and mutual growth.

"“Sasta Prime” Indian YouTubers Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan launch Fokus, and the internet is calling it a ripoff of WWE superstar Logan Paul's brand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/sasta-prime-indian-youtubers-fukra-insaan-and-triggered-insaan-launch-fokus-and-the-internet-is-calling-it-a-ripoff-of-wwe-superstar-logan-pauls-brand/articleshow/118483949.cms,"Image via Logan Paul and Triggered Insaan

“Inko dekh ke kisi Logan walo ka Prime drink yaad aaya 😂,”

“It looks like Prime’s third copy (not that Prime is good or something). They will def use Ruchika for promoting this chapri brand and getting views. Sasta Prime 😭.”

Fokus hit the market in February 2025, and yes, it’s significantly cheaper than Prime

“It’s like Prime... but for people who think 500 bucks is too much for a drink.”

Fans are already calling Fokus a copy of Prime, but will it actually sell?

Fukra Insaan (Abhishek Malhan) and Triggered Insaan (Nischay Malhan) just entered the hydration drink market, but instead of praise, they’re getting roasted. Their new drink, Fokus, looks eerily similar to Prime, the hydration brand by KSI and Logan Paul . The colors, the branding, even the bottle design—it’s all too familiar.Social media caught on immediately. One Reddit user didn’t hold back:basically calling Fokus a knockoff. Another user added,People aren’t mad. They’re just having fun with how obvious the similarities are. Fokus seems to be banking on the same influencer-heavy marketing strategy that made Prime popular, except at a much lower price point.Having hit the market in February 2025, Fokus is being marketed as an affordable hydration drink, available in flavors like Mango Pineapple, Kiwi Lemon, and Watermelon Strawberry. The drink contains coconut water, taurine, and ginseng extract, ingredients meant to provide hydration and energy.And the price? A three-pack costs Rs. 450. That’s way cheaper than Prime, which is ridiculously overpriced in India. One Redditor put it best:Fokus is clearly aiming at the younger crowd, the same people who built Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan’s careers. The two YouTubers have been posting behind-the-scenes content about the drink’s development, with their managers Mayank Mishra (Fukra Insaan’s manager) and Ankit Madaan (Triggered Insaan’s manager) handling the business side of things.The internet can’t unsee the similarities. From the branding to the influencer-driven promotions, Fokus is walking the same path that made Prime a global hit. But while people love making fun of the “Sasta Prime” branding, they’re still paying attention.Fokus launches across India in February 2025. Whether it thrives or just remains an inside joke on Reddit depends on how people actually like the drink. For updates, fans can follow their official Instagram handle @letsfokus.","Fukra insaan and triggered insaan have launched a new hydration drink, fokus.

How Trump’s tariffs can affect Apple

US President Donald Trump has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook is planning to shift manufacturing from Mexico to the US, a report claims. Trump reportedly disclosed the company’s move at a gathering of governors, however, the Cupertino-based tech giant has yet to make any official statement regarding the same.According to a report by Bloomberg, Trump cited a recent meeting with Cook at the White House to say that Apple “stopped two plants in Mexico” and will build products in the US instead. He also said that Cook has promised that Apple will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the US.“He’s [Cook] going to start building. Very big numbers — you have to speak to him. I assume they’re going to announce it at some point. They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” Bloomberg quoted Trump saying.The report didn't detail which manufacturing facilities Trump referred to, but it noted that Apple partner Foxconn Technology Group has a significant presence in Mexico and plans to expand there. While Foxconn produces the iPhone in Asia, Apple still relies predominantly on China for production.During the transition, Cook attended Trump’s inauguration last month and even visited his Mar-a-Lago estate. Meanwhile, Apple faces potential setbacks amid a deepening US-China trade dispute.Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese-made goods poses a significant challenge as Apple works to boost sluggish iPhone sales, and China is also reportedly considering investigating Apple's app fees and policies.This has further complicated matters given that China is the company’s largest manufacturing hub while the US remains its biggest market.Apple is also increasingly turning to domestic production through its partnership with TSMC which is building chip factories in Arizona to produce semiconductors for devices like the iPad and Apple Watch.","Us president donald trump has revealed that apple ceo tim cook is planning to shift manufacturing from mexico to the us.

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)

Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

Potential

spillover risk

Monitoring and

pandemic preparedness

A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of Chinese researchers, raising concerns about possible future spillover events. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2 , was found to use the same human receptor as SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for Covid-19.According to the South China Morning Post, the study was led by Shi Zhengli , a renowned virologist known as ""batwoman"" due to her extensive research on bat coronaviruses.The research involved scientists from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology . Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Tuesday.The newly discovered virus belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. It is a new lineage of the HKU5 coronavirus, initially identified in Japanese pipistrelle bats in Hong Kong.The research found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor, the same receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. ""We report the discovery and isolation of a distinct lineage (lineage 2) of HKU5-CoV, which can utilise not only bat ACE2 but also human ACE2 and various mammalian ACE2 orthologs,"" the scientists wrote.The study warned that bat merbecoviruses ""pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.""According to the researchers, HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 receptors in multiple animal species, increasing the likelihood of interspecies transmission.Despite its potential for human infection, the researchers cautioned against exaggerating the threat. They noted that the virus’s efficiency in binding to human ACE2 is “significantly lower” than that of SARS-CoV-2. ""The risk of [HKU5-CoV-2] emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,"" they said.Earlier this month, Cell published a study by researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle and Wuhan University, which concluded that while the HKU5 strain could bind to bat and other mammalian ACE2 receptors, it did not show ""efficient"" binding to human ACE2.However, Shi’s team countered that HKU5-CoV-2 appears to be better adapted to human receptors than its predecessor, lineage 1, and ""may have a broader host range and a higher potential for interspecies infection,"" South China Morning Post reported.Given the potential risks, the researchers focused on the need for further monitoring. The World Health Organization has already included merbecoviruses on its list of emerging pathogens for pandemic preparedness.Shi Zhengli, who played a key role in Covid-19 research, has previously denied claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for the pandemic.While the origins of Covid-19 remain debated, some studies suggest the virus originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate host.","A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of chinese researchers.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Reducing errors is the big challenge



Anyone who has sat through a third-grade science class knows there are three primary states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.Microsoft now says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a powerful machine, called a quantum computer, that could accelerate the development of everything from batteries to medicines to artificial intelligence.On Wednesday, Microsoft's scientists said they had built what is known as a ""topological qubit"" based on this new phase of physical existence, which could be harnessed to solve mathematical, scientific and technological problems.With the development, Microsoft is raising the stakes in what is set to be the next big technological contest, beyond today's race over artificial intelligence. Scientists have chased the dream of a quantum computer -- a machine that could exploit the strange and exceedingly powerful behavior of subatomic particles or very cold objects -- since the 1980s.The push heated up in December when Google unveiled an experimental quantum computer that needed just five minutes to complete a calculation that most supercomputers could not finish in 10 septillion years -- longer than the age of the known universe.Microsoft's quantum technology could leapfrog the methods under development at Google. As part of its research, the company built multiple topological qubits inside a new kind of computer chip that combines the strengths of the semiconductors that power classical computers with the superconductors that are typically used to build a quantum computer.When such a chip is cooled to extremely low temperatures, it behaves in unusual and powerful ways that Microsoft believes will allow it to solve technological, mathematical and scientific problems that classical machines never could. The technology is not as volatile as other quantum technologies, the company said, making it easier to exploit its power.Some question whether Microsoft has achieved this milestone, and many leading academics said quantum computers would not be fully realized for decades. But Microsoft's scientists said their methods would help them reach the finish line sooner.""We view this as something that is years away, not decades away,"" said Chetan Nayak , a Microsoft technical fellow who led the team that built the technology.Microsoft's technology, which was detailed in a research paper published in the science journal Nature on Wednesday, adds new impetus to a race that could reshape the technological landscape. In addition to accelerating progress across many technological and scientific fields, a quantum computer could be powerful enough to break the encryption that protects national secrets.Any advances are set to have geopolitical implications. Even as the United States explores quantum computing primarily through corporations like Microsoft and a wave of startups, the Chinese government has said it is investing $15.2 billion in the technology. The European Union has committed $7.2 billion.Quantum computing, which builds on decades of research into a type of physics called quantum mechanics, is still an experimental technology. But after recent strides by Microsoft, Google and others, scientists are confident that the technology will eventually live up to its promise.""Quantum computing is a thrilling prospect for physics, and for the world,"" said Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.To understand quantum computing, it helps to know how a traditional computer works. A smartphone, laptop or desktop PC relies on tiny chips made from semiconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity in some but not all situations. These chips store and process numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on. They perform these calculations by manipulating ""bits"" of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.A quantum computer operates differently. A quantum bit, or qubit, relies on the curious behavior of subatomic particles or exotic materials cooled to extremely low temperatures.When it is either extremely small or extremely cold, a single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time. By harnessing that behavior, scientists can build a qubit that holds a combination of 1 and 0. This means that two qubits can hold four values at once. And as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Companies use a variety of techniques to build these machines. In the United States, most, including Google, build qubits using superconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity without losing the energy they are transmitting. They create these superconductors by cooling metals to extremely low temperatures.Microsoft has bet on an approach that few others are taking: combining semiconductors with superconductors. The basic principle -- along with the name topological qubit -- was first proposed in 1997 by Alexei Kitaev, a Russian American physicist.The company began working on this unusual project in the early 2000s, when many researchers did not think such technology was possible. It is Microsoft's longest-running research project.""This is something that all three CEOs of this company have bet on,"" Satya Nadella , Microsoft's CEO, said in an interview. (The company's previous CEOs were Bill Gates, a founder, and Steve Ballmer , who ran Microsoft in the early 2000s.)The company has now created a single device that is part indium arsenide (a type of semiconductor) and part aluminum (a superconductor at low temperatures). When it is cooled to about 400 degrees below zero, it exhibits a kind of otherworldly behavior that might make quantum computers possible.Philip Kim, a physics professor at Harvard University, said Microsoft's new creation was significant because topological qubits could accelerate the development of quantum computers. ""If everything works out, Microsoft's research could be revolutionary,"" he said.But Jason Alicea, a professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology, questioned whether the company had actually built a topological qubit, saying the behavior of quantum systems is often hard to prove.""A topological qubit is possible in principle, and people agree it is a worthwhile goal,"" Alicea said. ""You have to verify, though, that a device behaves in all the magical ways that theory predicts it should; otherwise, the reality may turn out to be less rosy for quantum computing. Fortunately, Microsoft is now set up to try.""","Microsoft says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a quantum computer.

Google Pay, a prominent UPI ( Unified Payments Interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments , including electricity and cooking gas bills. Previously free for low-value transactions, the service now charges between 0.5% and 1% plus GST for payments made using credit and debit cards. With this, Google Pay now follows some other UPI apps like PhonePe and Paytm that charge similar fee.This development follows the platform's previous implementation of a Rs 3 convenience fee for mobile recharges implemented over a year ago.A review by ET revealed that a customer paid approximately Rs 15 as ""convenience fee"" whilst settling an electricity bill with a credit card. The charge, which included GST, was also described as a ""processing fee for debit and credit card transactions"".An industry insider explained to the financial daily that the introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions , as service providers aim to recover payment processing costs.

The platform processed UPI transactions worth Rs 8.26 lakh crore as of January.According to an informed source, charging convenience or platform fees is standard practice in the industry. The source indicated that while Google Pay previously covered this expense, it has now opted to transfer the cost to users.Google Pay's website indicates that while convenience fees apply to card payments, UPI transactions linked directly to bank accounts remain fee-free. The timing of when these charges were introduced remains unclear.For specific bill payments including water, piped gas and electricity, PhonePe implements convenience fees on card transactions, as stated on their website. Similarly, Paytm levies platform fees between Rs 1 to Rs 40 for UPI recharges and various utility bill payments, including gas, water and credit card settlements.UPI's widespread adoption hasn't translated into substantial revenue for fintech firms. PwC's study reveals that processing UPI person-to-merchant transactions costs stakeholders approximately 0.25% of transaction value.

Tata Capital board to look at potential fund-raise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-capital-board-to-look-at-potential-fund-raise/articleshow/118463803.cms,"MUMBAI: The board of Tata Capital, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), will meet on Tuesday to discuss a potential fund-raise through a rights issue. The Reserve Bank of India has classified Tata Capital as an upper-layer non-banking financial services company (NBFC) and has directed the firm to list its shares by September. Tata Sons, which has about 93% ownership in Tata Capital, is expected to participate in the rights issue to maintain its current shareholding in the NBFC .Tata Capital requires consistent capital infusion to support its growth rate of 20-25%, and the rights issue aims to fulfill this requirement, said a person familiar with the matter. The remaining 7% ownership in Tata Capital is distributed among various Tata Group entities, select executives from both Tata Group and external organisations, and the Washington-based International Finance Corporation.A rights issue is a more beneficial option for unlisted companies to raise funds compared to preferential allotment, as it eliminates the requirement for fair value assessment. The main advantage lies in its uniform pricing structure, where all existing shareholders must subscribe to new shares at the same price, said Katalyst advisors’ executive director Binoy Parikh.Tata Capital’s proposed fund-raise through a rights issue follows recent changes to its memorandum of association (MoA) and articles of association (AoA). The company, in its January communication to shareholders requesting approval for MoA and AoA amendments, disclosed having around 29,000 shareholders.To comply with sections 25 and 42 of the Companies Act and prevent further expansion of its shareholder base through corporate actions, Tata Capital said it has introduced a new provision in its AoA to restrict shareholders from renouncing their rights in rights issues until the company's equity shares are listed on the stock exchanges. It clarified that this restriction does not prevent existing shareholders from participating in or subscribing to additional equity shares through rights issues.Tata Capital is the largest financial services entity within the Tata Group and is identified as a crucial element for growth by the conglomerate. The proposed IPO, which could involve the issuance of new shares, could result in a reduction of Tata Sons' ownership by about 5%. According to listing regulations, companies must maintain a 25% public shareholding within three years post-listing.In a note dated February 5, Fitch Ratings said that Tata Sons' ownership in Tata Capital is unlikely to fall below 75% after the proposed public listing. The IPO will strengthen Tata Capital's capital base and decrease its leverage further, Fitch said, adding that the NBFC’s debt-to-tangible equity ratio has shown improvement, declining to 6.3x by the conclusion of 1HFY25, compared to 7.2x at the end of FY22.","The reserve bank of india has classified tata capital as an upper-layer non-banking financial services company (nbfc) tata sons, which has about 93% ownership in tata capital, is expected to participate in the rights issue to maintain its current shareholding in the nbfc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118463875,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64074,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
