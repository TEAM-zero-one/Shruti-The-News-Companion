Proof needed, not promises

NEW DELHI: When questions are raised about the safety of any food article, India's food regulator will now ask for proof, not promises. From what a product contains and how much Indians actually eat to whether it's safe over time, every claim will have to be backed by data to assess its safety.From Jan 1, 2026, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has made it mandatory for all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards to follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence. The move comes after the regulator found that many past requests lacked basic data or a uniform structure, making proper risk assessment difficult.The new rule does not trigger an automatic re-examination of all foods already in the market. It applies only when a stakeholder approaches FSSAI seeking a scientific risk assessment - either for introducing a new product or reviewing an existing one. In such cases, the burden of proving safety will rest with the applicant.Under the new format, submissions must spell out nutritional information, how much Indians consume the product, results of toxicological studies, and evidence on safe intake limits, along with allergy risks and supporting scientific studies.The data will be reviewed by FSSAI's Science and Standards Division and assessed by expert panels, which will decide whether a product can be cleared, continued, restricted or subjected to tighter limits.Officials say the sharper focus on Indian eating habits is crucial as packaged foods become more common and overseas data may not reflect real exposure.""This is an important step to protect public health. Earlier, many foods were approved using limited or incomplete information. Since Indian food habits, portion sizes and sensitivities are very different from those in other countries, asking for proper proof about long-term safety, how much people eat and possible allergy risks helps make food rules more practical, science-based and safer for Indian consumers,"" said Anjali Bhola, dietician at National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar, All India Institute of Medical Sciences.FSSAI has also assured stakeholders that data submitted for risk assessment will be treated as confidential and used only for scientific evaluation and policy decisions. For consumers, the message is simple: when food safety is questioned, evidence will now decide what stays on the plate.","Fssai has made it mandatory for all submissions seeking a food safety review or changes in food standards to follow a single, standardised format supported by scientific evidence.

Immigration policy expert Rosemary Jenks said that it's ironic that Americans are made to feel sorry for Indian H-1B holders who are stranded at home due to a sudden delay in visa appointments, but no one in the US is feeling sorry for them. Companies are not waiting for them and are in fact going ahead to hire Americans, Jenks said, calling it a positive development for the US.""Indians make up about 70% of H-1Bs, and many are now stranded in India while visas take longer. We’re supposed to feel sorry for them because it's taking longer for their visas to get approved,"" Jenks said, appearing on Steve Bannon's show. On the show, Bannon, a former aide of Donald Trump, called for a 10-year moratorium on all kinds of immigration.Jenks said that the social media vetting of these temporary visas that the Trump administration started is taking more time to ensure that people who are coming to the US are not coming to kill Americans or otherwise mess with the system. ""Perfectly reasonable and rational,"" Jenks said, disparaging the narrative that Indians are 'stranded' in their own country because of the sudden delay.""Nobody is feeling sorry for them here because, first of all, some of their employers apparently are deciding that it's too much trouble to wait for them and keep the jobs open for them and are potentially hiring Americans to do those jobs, we would hope,"" Jenks said.""This would be a perfect time to say 'okay we are done, no more,"" Jenks said, supporting Bannon's moratorium proposal.The Indian government has raised the issue of visa delays with the US government but visa appointment dates are getting rescheduled to later part of 2026 and 2027 as the social media vetting has turned everything upside down.","Rosemary jenks says it's ironic that americans are made to feel sorry for indian h-1b holders who are stranded at home due to a sudden delay in visa appointments.

Iyo Sky’s WWE salary and contract growth

From Stardom to global star, Japan career and legacy earnings

Endorsements, merchandise, and net worth outlook in 2025

With the Japanese wrestling star now regularly in the main-event picture for WWE women, Iyo Sky's net worth in 2025 has been a popular conversation piece. Her earnings today, from championship bonuses to merchandise sales, attest to a career that has transitioned over time from cult fandom to global household name.Although numbers aren't released, the path from Japan's top promotions to WWE's biggest stages paints a picture of how the best wrestlers create generational wealth. Whether it be salary, bonuses, licensing fees, or the value of the brand she continues to create, all will impact her financial position in 2025.According to the report, Iyo Sky has built her earning potential significantly since signing with WWE and moving up the ranks from NXT to the main roster. Wrestlers of her stature usually earn a base salary, plus performance bonuses, pay-per-view bonuses, and a cut from merchandise sales. With observers estimating the annual WWE revenue at Sky in recent peaks to be at a mid-to-high six-figure amount, with recent high-profile title changes typically triggering renegotiated rights prices or bonus clauses.Individual contracts are not a matter of public record with WWE, but women’s champions find numbers on the high end of roster averages, applied through exposure and marketing value of a particular talent, although the far-appraised annual salary is difficult to determine.This places Sky in a strong negotiating position as WWE becomes her number one income source in 2025, and we're not talking her sole means of income.Sky made a name for herself in Japan prior to WWE, particularly in World Wonder Ring Stardom, where she was one of the promotion's defining talents. They were years that delivered long-lasting value to the brand as well as reliable income. Profits are still used to provide art for the calendars and T-shirts of the time, and continued popularity with fans in Japan contributes to her earnings from there too, despite her fully switching to the WWE a while ago.She gained a higher notoriety in foreign countries, which in turn made her transition into WWE a lot easier and money better! Analysts include these early career earnings in net-worth estimates, as well as the ongoing royalty checks, which, though small compared to her WWE pay today, add up over time.Outside of her wrestling pay, Sky also makes money from WWE merchandise, video games, and there have also been some brand deals here and there. For performers with stronger fan bases, such as champions who regularly appear on TV, merchandise royalties can add to significant sums. She also gets a cut of WWE's digital and licensing ecosystem that includes collectibles and gaming.Also Read: Roxanne Perez net worth in 2025: WWE earnings, contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and rising career","Iyo sky has built her earning potential significantly since signing with wwe and moving up the ranks from nxt to the main roster.

Belle Delphine and twomad’s 2022 collaboration resurfaces after viral tweet







Belle Delphine is alive. A viral post on X confused many people, but the claim about her death is not true. The rumor started after an old photo of Belle Delphine and YouTuber twomad began trending again on Monday, December 29. The image was shared by the X account @LostMemeArchive with the caption, “this did not age well at all.”Soon after, another user, @neo_jery, quote-posted the image and wrote, “notice how everyone in this image is dead.” That single line caused panic online.

Twomad died in February 2024 at the age of 23. Belle Delphine is alive and has been fully active on social media. She is sharing posts as recently as last week. No news outlet has reported her death. The viral claim is false and misleading.Belle Delphine, whose real name is Mary-Belle Kirschner, became famous online for her cosplay style and bold internet persona.

Erika Hammond’s WWE career and transformation into a fitness entrepreneur

Ankur Jain’s fintech empire and the couple’s combined net worth

In 2025, Erika Hammond and Ankur Jain are one of the most followed couples in the world of business and pop culture. Both of them from outlandishly opposing worlds: professional wrestling and boutique fitness versus billion-dollar fintech renovation. The shift from WWE talent to fitness entrepreneur for Hammond, along with Jain establishing himself as a technology founder, sparked public interest in the two's careers and wallets.Interest has only intensified since their over-the-top nuptials and globetrotting antics. Although the couple is known for keeping personal finances private, various industry estimates and business valuations indicate their combined net worth comfortably nears some of the most elite high-net-worth households, with most of the wealth attributable to Jain's tech companies and much of the remainder from Hammond's fitness, branding, and creator economy income.Erika Hammond appeared on the national scene first as a performer as Veronica Lane in WWE NXT, as well as in media and announcing roles during that time. Her wrestling career, while rather short, lent her some visibility and greater name recognition, along with other contacts that would prove useful post-wrestling.Hammond moved into the emerging boutique fitness space after leaving WWE. She eventually became one of Rumble Boxing's founding trainers in New York before evolving her own fitness concepts that included boxing-inspired HIIT and strength training programs.These businesses established her as a name in the high-end fitness community, enabling her to monetize in-person sessions, video workouts, brand partnerships, and social media. Her net worth in a 2025 breakdown is not found individually, but she earns like a modern fitness millionaire based on her own narrative rather than the days of sports contracts.Ankur Jain is the founder/CEO at Bilt Rewards, a fintech platform allowing consumers to earn rewards on rent & daily spend. The company has since gained significant partnerships and investors during its time there, with its valuation in the multi-billion-dollar range. Bilt is also the bedrock of Jain's personal wealth. Jain has an equity stake in Bilt.Depending on company valuation and market conditions, business media estimates Jain’s net worth in 2025 to be about $1.2 billion. When her wealth is added to Hammond's own fitness-related income and branding, the pair are labelled a hundred-million-dollar couple. Implanting an impression of luxurious life with expensive properties, six-star traveling, and glamorous parties brought by this memoir billionaire exemplifies that new technology entrepreneurship and personal brand are the two keys to wealth in the 21st century.Also Read: Who is The Boogeyman’s wife?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.Rockstar has not announced the official price for India. However, early industry estimates suggest the standard edition may be priced around ₹9,000, which is much higher than GTA V’s console launch price of ₹3,499.","Former rockstar developer mike york warns that further delays to grand theft auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard.

The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's josh woodward has jolted openai, forcing a 'code red' with his gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged chatgpt's dominance. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for google's ai resurgence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126187250,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
