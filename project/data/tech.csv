Government approach to AI adoption

Education as the long-term lever

The UK Transformation Dialogues 2026, conducted by The Times of India in Dehradun, spotlighted artificial intelligence's role in infrastructure expansion and education reform as key pillars of Uttarakhand’s next phase of growth.The panel discussion on “Building the Growth Engine: Infrastructure, Education & AI-Led Investment” brought together Mayank, Founder, CEO & Managing Director of ADROSONIC; Shikhar Saxena, Additional Director, Department of Industries, Government of Uttarakhand; and Prof Dr Sachin Ghai of Graphic Era University to deliberate on how the state can leverage technology and partnerships to drive sector-led development.The UK Transformation Dialogues 2026 is designed as a strategic platform to examine Uttarakhand’s shift from terrain-bound limitations to sector-driven growth. The forum convenes policymakers, industry leaders and domain experts to explore progress across infrastructure, education, tourism, healthcare, women empowerment and grassroots enterprise, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.Detailing the structural framework of artificial intelligence, ADROSONIC founder Mayank said AI must be understood beyond just end-user applications.He outlined five layers of AI — infrastructure (chips and computing power), data quality, models (the “brain” of AI where companies such as OpenAI operate), orchestration (enabling multiple actions from a single query), and applications, where users interact directly with AI systems.“If your data quality is not good, you can’t have AI on top of it. If we feed it wrong data, AI will always give a wrong response,” he said, stressing that data quality is very important for accurate outcome.Highlighting Uttarakhand’s talent pool, he said nurturing skilled professionals and building smaller innovation hubs could enable the state to offer AI-driven services globally despite geographical constraints.“We have an enormous amount of talent. If we nurture this talent and build small hubs, we can provide services anywhere in the world using the power of AI — and that itself will fuel the growth of the entire state,” he said.He further suggested that if private institutions and the government join hands, they can share their respective challenges, enabling universities to undertake research and then organisations aid in arriving at practical solutions.However, he cautioned that technology must be applied meaningfully. “No matter how cool a technology is, until you find how it’s going to be applied, it’s of no use.”He also explained significance of tech saying with relations to businesses saying, ""Technology is for the business, business is not for the technology.""The additional director, department of industries, Uttarakhand government, Shikhar Saxena acknowledged that governments have historically been slow in adopting new technologies, citing delayed use of computers and specialised software in earlier decades; but are now moving faster.“Whenever some new technology comes, government is usually the last to use it,” he said. However he noted the relatively faster speed recently, as in 2015 many processes were still offline, though they now been digitised.While the Uttarakhand government is not yet fully deploying AI across departments, he said the state intends to move faster this time. Referring to the launch of the Uttarakhand AI Mission on November 26, Saxena said the government aims to take a ""first-mover advantage"".For infrastructure bodies such as the Uttarakhand Infrastructure and Industrial Development Board (UIIDB), AI adoption is expected to be more proactive, he added.“Saxena further highlighted a key problem in govts which he belives can be solved by AI. ""Understaffing is a chronic problem in almost all government departments. AI can help solve this problem, and that’s why we are focusing a lot on it,” he said.Graphic Era University professor Dr Sachin Ghai emphasised talked about technology-led growth through changes in curriculum and institutional thinking.Recalling that one of Uttarakhand’s earlier challenges was the outmigration of students seeking higher education outside the state, he said expanding quality institutions within Uttarakhand was a crucial step.Talking about one aspect he said, “We recognised the importance of participation of all stakeholders,”, adding that education should “always enlighten and empower.”Investment in infrastructure, he stressed, must be matched by investment in people and partnerships, with academia, industry and government working together to build a resilient growth engine for the state.","The uk transformation dialogues 2026 is designed to examine uttarakhand’s shift from terrain-bound limitations to sector-driven growth.

Public reasoning has increased in the digital era

Labels , ideology and the Left–Right debate

Popularity versus truth in public discourse

On corruption and selective narratives

Digital media, misinformation and bias

Uttarakhand ’s growth and structural challenges

Digital governance and the role of critics

NEW DELHI: The Times of India’s flagship Uttarakhand Transformation Dialogues 2026 brought together policymakers, academics and industry leaders in Dehradun on Friday, with a sharp focus on the state’s next phase of growth.Among the key sessions was a fireside chat featuring scientist and author Anand Ranganathan, who spoke on the theme “Digital Education, Governance & Public Reason”.The session explored how digital platforms, education and governance shape public discourse and policy outcomes.The larger event, organised by The Times of India, aims to create collaboration between government, industry and civil society.Opening the discussion, the moderator asked whether the scope of public reasoning in society has grown or shrunk in the digital age.Ranganathan was clear in his response.“It has certainly increased. There is no two ways about it,” he said.Recalling the 1970s and 1980s, he noted that earlier generations had very limited avenues to respond to opinions published in newspapers or aired on radio and television.“If we didn’t like it, the only option was to roll up the newspaper and fling it against the wall. On rare occasions, you would write a letter to the editor.I had one published once,” he said, adding that there was a sense of frustration in not being heard.In contrast, he described today’s environment as a “problem of plenty”, where people have multiple platforms to voice their views. While acknowledging that extremes can be disruptive, he said he would prefer a noisy democracy over enforced silence.The conversation then moved to whether society is becoming overly opinionated, forming views before facts.Ranganathan argued that political labels are often imposed rather than clearly defined. In the Indian context, he said, Western definitions of Left and Right do not neatly apply.“In India, one can perhaps define the Left, but it’s very difficult to define the Right. In fact, in many domains, I consider the BJP a left-wing party, economically, it is certainly left-wing,” he remarked.He added that labels can sometimes simplify arguments by giving people a sense of belonging to an ideological group. “It’s convenient,” he said, noting that he has learnt to accept such labels in “the right spirit”.Asked whether he faces pressure to adopt popular positions rather than factual ones, Ranganathan said he has consistently relied on a scientific approach since he began writing and appearing in public debates in 2008.“I have always looked at everything through the lens of science. If you do that, you can never go wrong,” he said.He admitted that public reactions often fluctuate. “People love what I say when it conforms to their thinking. The next day, they troll me because I’ve said something they disagree with. That happens almost every day.”Referring to debates around textbook references to judicial corruption, Ranganathan argued that institutions should not be shielded from scrutiny.“Is there corruption in the judiciary? It’s not me saying it, former Chief Justices have acknowledged it,” he said, adding that if students are being educated about institutions, they should understand the “full picture”.However, he cautioned against selective criticism. “If you talk about corruption, talk about it everywhere. Don’t be selective,” he said, pointing out that corruption is discussed in politics, science, medicine and sports.He also criticised what he described as a tendency in the media to portray current problems as unprecedented.“Science teaches you to ask, has this happened before? Look at the data before drawing conclusions,” he said, urging comparisons across states and over time before assigning blame.On the role of digital media in spreading both information and misinformation, Ranganathan said eliminating misinformation entirely is unrealistic.“You can’t eliminate misinformation entirely. It happens naturally,” he said.He argued that exposure to diverse viewpoints is the best corrective. Drawing an example from children of civil servants who move across states and encounter different narratives, he said, such mobility often gives them a more balanced understanding.“The only way to circumvent bias is to know the other opinion. Always read two newspapers,” he advised.He described disagreement as healthy. “You and I have agreed on some issues and disagreed on others. I see that as diversity, not difference. The listener benefits by hearing both sides. That is the democratisation digital media has given us.”Turning specifically to Uttarakhand, Ranganathan presented a mix of achievements and concerns.He said the state’s GDP per capita is about $1,000 higher than the national average. Welfare schemes, including toilets, bank accounts, tap water connections and Ayushman cards, have reached nearly 100% of the targeted population.However, he stressed that long-term planning is crucial. “This is a golden opportunity to draw a roadmap, not for five years, because governments come and go, but for 15 to 20 years,” he said.Highlighting what he termed a “problem of plenty”, he noted that while Uttarakhand’s population is around one million, tourist arrivals are about 6.5 million.“Everything has a flip side,” he said.He pointed out that 80% of the state still depends on agriculture, yet in the past 15 years, about 28% of cultivable land has been lost, largely due to construction, urbanisation and tourism. Agricultural produce availability has declined by around 15%.“You are facing a situation where one sector is doing extremely well — but structural balance must be maintained,” he cautioned.On governance, Ranganathan observed that merely providing digital information is not enough.“You can provide all the digital information you want. But digital information is not interactive. You tend to pick solutions from those who praise you. Critics are often pushed aside,” he said, underlining the need for inclusive dialogue.The Uttarakhand Transformation Dialogues also featured sessions with various famous personalities, focusing on culture, gender and heritage as drivers of growth.","The times of india’s flagship uttarakhand transformation dialogues 2026 brought together policymakers, academics and industry leaders in dehradun.

'AI Only Works With What Has Been Expressed So Far': Prasoon Joshi Gets Candid At DNPA 2026

At the DNPA Conclave 2026, policymakers and industry leaders came together to discuss the evolving digital ecosystem and the challenges of governing communications in the time of artificial intelligence. Speaking during a session on ‘The Regulatory Reset: Governing India’s Digital Communications in the AI era’, ministry of electronics and information technology secretary S Krishnan outlined how India seeks to balance free expression with platform accountability.He said, “Freedom of expression is subject to certain restrictions which are ingrained in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. Those grounds are very clear. So on those grounds there could be reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech. And the courts have repeatedly upheld that.”Krishnan added that social media regulations do not go beyond the constitutional mandate. He highlighted Section 69A of the IT Act as a key regulatory mechanism, which addresses certain restrictions permitted under Article 19(2). Other grounds under Article 19(2), such as defamatory and obscene content are dealt with through separate legal provisions but form part of the wider regulatory framework.Krishnan added that the government works within the framework of the law. He emphasized that platforms operating in India must not go against constitutionally valid restrictions, adding that if they wanted to operate in India, they should abide by Indian laws.When asked why sensationalised content tends to get wider reach, Krishnan said that it is a deeper reflection of society. He also highlighted the government’s new rule regarding the labelling of synthetically generated content so as to ensure users are aware of what they are consuming.His remarks underscored the government’s position that while digital innovation and AI are reshaping communication, regulatory oversight will continue to operate firmly within constitutional boundaries.","S krishnan at dnpa conclave 2026.

At the DNPA Conclave 2026, Sampark Foundation founder Vineet Nayyar shared insights on artificial intelligence, business models and the future of the publishing industry, urging stakeholders to adapt to technological shifts rather than resist them.Speaking about AI platforms and their commercial interests, Nayyar said, “Anybody who comes with an AI model is interested in subscription. The truth of the matter is that when India-Pak matches were played you could see ChatGPT and Google ads. Their primary interest is subscription. Therefore, I would take whatever they say with a grain of salt.”Highlighting the scale of disruption ahead, he said, “50% of what Indian IT is doing is going to be done by AI tools.” However, he added that this shift would also expand opportunities, noting that corporate technology spending is expected to increase by 8 - 14% depending on the industry. “The challenge in front of Indian IT is that are you part of an evolving solution where demand is high or are you trapped in the past,” he said.Talking to the publishing sector, Nayyar emphasised the need for a shift in mindset. “Publishing industry should look at technology as an opportunity and not as a challenge.Now the question is - how to look at this technology? You must understand that this technology is automating tasks, not jobs. And there is a difference between automatic tasks and jobs. The task which you were doing earlier - editing, writing, some of that will be more efficiently done by (AI) agents you have trained on expressing your way of opinion. ” He urged industry professionals to move up the value chain in keeping with AI’s capabilities.Nayyar’s points of discussion sent out a clear message that while AI will transform workflows, those who adapt, innovate and move up the value chain will be at an advantage to thrive in the new digital economy.","Sampark foundation founder vineet nayyar shared insights on artificial intelligence, business models and the future of the publishing industry.

‘Social media giants must be accountable’

NEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Thursday social media platforms should compensate creators of the content they use for earning billions in profit.“Social media platforms must also share revenue in a fair way with the people who are creating content, whether it is news persons, conventional media, creators in far-flung areas, influencers, or professors and researchers disseminating their work using the platforms. .. there has to be a fair share of revenue with the people who are creating the content,” Vaishnaw said at the Storyboard 18 Digital News Publishers Association Conclave.Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s pitch for “fair compensation” comes amid a debate raging globally over the refusal of social media giants to compensate creators of content which they have used to make huge profits.The conduct of platforms was under focus in the deliberations at the conclave, with Vaishnaw saying that social media companies can no longer function as neutral intermediaries. They now operate like publishers and must be accountable for the content they host and amplify, he said.Vaishnaw said internet’s evolution into a powerful media ecosystem demands a redistribution of responsibility. “The nature of internet has changed... today it has become a powerful media outlet, where, like media, the platforms must take responsibility,” he said, adding, “Platforms must take responsibility for what they are publishing.”Warning deepfakes, disinformation and synthetic media are corroding public trust, the minister said the damage goes beyond individual harm. “The entire society is built upon trust in institutions... that core tenet of trust is under threat,” he said, pointing to the rapid spread of fabricated images and videos through algorithm-driven virality.The I&B minister also emphasised that synthetic content must not be created without explicit consent.","Information and broadcasting minister ashwini vaishnaw said social media platforms should compensate creators of the content they use for earning billions in profit. “social media platforms must also share revenue in a fair way with the people who are creating content, whether it is news persons, conventional media, creators in far-flung areas, influencers, or professors and researchers disseminating their work using the platforms,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128834384,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-686631,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Describing BSNL's lavish arrangements for director Vivek Banzal's now called-off trip to Prayagraj ""improper and absurd"", communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia Wednesday said that ""appropriate action"" will be taken against the senior executive of the state-run company.""I have made it very clear that this is improper and a violation of all the established rules and traditions. It is completely unacceptable in 21st century. It is completely absurd and shocking. A show-cause notice has already been issued to the director with a seven-day response period,"" the minister told reporters.The lavish, four-page instructions detailing snan kits, personal toiletries, undergarments and other comforts, including a retinue of nearly 50 officials to attend to to Banzal and a chief general manager, had sparked concern over misuse of official resources.Showcause notices have been issued to Banzal, a telecom service officer, and two executives - Brijendra Singh, principal GM, and Jogeshwar Verma, DGM, - who were posted in Prayagraj have been transferred. Verma, who was part of Singh's office, had issued the instructions.""We will take strictest possible action. We don't want any distraction from BSNL's focus on improving customer service and network improvement,"" said an official.Banzal had planned a two-day trip to Prayagraj, starting Wednesday, and BSNL had deputed a posse of executives to receive him and take care of arrangements, which included a bath in Ganga. The instructions, running into four pages, asked the PSU staff to arrange for eight sets of ""snan"" or bath kits for men and women, including towels, undergarments, slippers, combs, mirrors, soap, shampoo, and oil, along with a bed sheet.The office order, which went viral on social media, also asked officials to make arrangements at a hotel and circuit house, which included dry fruits, fruit bowls, towels, toiletries, and shaving kits for the director, and other guests. Nearly 50 officials were to be deployed to attend to Banzal and a chief general manager.Following uproar, the telecom service officer called off the trip, which also included visits to temples and some meetings.According to the BSNL website, Banzal's ""never say rest"" attitude and constant innovation have helped drive growth in the fixed-line business. Since 2016, he has been promoting and managing Bharat Fiber, BSNL IT framework and other services.

Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated predicts early Day 3 pick return for Chicago Bears Pro Bowl linebacker Tremaine Edmunds



Tremaine Edmunds is suddenly at the center of a big decision in Chicago. The Chicago Bears are trying to fix their roster and manage money as they think about becoming real Super Bowl contenders. One name now linked to trade talks is 27 year old Pro Bowl linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who is set to make $15 million this season. According to Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated, Edmunds could bring back an “early Day 3” draft pick if the Bears move him. That means a fourth or fifth round pick.For Chicago, that would be a solid return. The team has been connected to trade rumors around DJ Moore, Gervon Dexter and Tyson Bagent, but Breer believes Edmunds is the most likely to move. The reason is simple. The Bears may want to clear salary space, and Edmunds carries a large cap number. If they can trade him instead of cutting him, they would at least get something in return.Albert Breer wrote, “And so as the Bears seek a potential trade partner to shed a little salary, there should be a market for the big, athletic, still relatively young linebacker. What sort of return will Edmunds bring? My guess is that an early Day 3 pick is how most teams would value him.”That prediction matters. If the Chicago Bears can land a fourth or fifth round pick for Tremaine Edmunds, it would be seen as a win for general manager Ryan Poles. Edmunds is viewed as a possible cut candidate if no trade happens. So getting any draft value instead of releasing him for nothing would help.On the field, Edmunds has shown strong production. In 13 games, he recorded 112 total tackles, four interceptions, nine passes defended, one sack, three tackles for loss and three quarterback hits. In coverage, he allowed a 77.7 quarterback rating, which is considered very good for an off ball linebacker. Those numbers could attract teams that need help in pass defense.Still, his $15 million salary is a key factor. Some teams might wait to see if he is released. But if a team truly wants him, trading for him removes the risk of losing him in free agency. For now, Albert Breer’s report gives the Bears hope that there is a real market for their Pro Bowl linebacker.","Albert breer of sports illustrated predicts early day 3 pick return for chicago bears pro bowl linebacker tremaine edmunds.

Economic and geopolitical impacts

Reactions on social media platforms

The world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence, according to Dario Amodei, the chief executive officer of Anthropic, a leading AI company. In a recent interview, Amodei described the rapid evolution of AI systems as an “AI tsunami” that is approaching society faster than most people realise. He said that AI is getting closer to being able to do things that people can do faster than expected, but most of the world is still not ready for what that means. There is a lot of talk right now about how AI could change jobs, industries, the economy, and the balance of power in the world. People are paying attention to Amodei's comments because they suggest that both public knowledge and rules may not be keeping up with new technologies. The comments also show that people in the AI research community are very worried about how fast and how much innovation will change things.According to Amodei, society is at a moment where powerful AI systems are moving beyond simple tasks and are beginning to perform complex functions once thought to require deep human intelligence. In an interview on a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, he said the world must recognise the large-scale changes ahead, rather than dismissing them as insignificant.He used the term “tsunami” to describe AI’s rapid rise, adding that many still treat it as “just a trick of the light. ”Amodei explained that automation is already affecting technical areas such as coding, mathematics, and scientific research. He said that AI models are increasingly handling routine and specialised work previously done by humans, potentially leading to major shifts in labour markets and business models.The CEO said that the rise of advanced AI systems could have big effects on the economy and the world as a whole. He said that the spread of technology won't be limited to one industry or sector; it could also affect jobs, global markets, and competition between countries. AI investments and tools are already influencing stock prices and investor behaviour, with some financial commentators dubbing recent market reactions the “Claude Crash,” after Anthropic’s Claude models, which are competitors to other major AI systems.Amodei said that while human-centred jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills may persist longer, roles involving repetitive or structured cognitive tasks are likely to change first. He noted that coding may be one of the earliest areas where AI takes on a significant share of the work.People on tech forums and in online communities have been talking about what Amodei said. People on Reddit agreed with some of his warnings, saying that AI could have huge effects on the economy that would affect not just tech jobs but also many other areas, including healthcare, education, and manufacturing. Some said that investors and markets are very worried because companies and workers are trying to figure out how AI will change their fields and daily operations.The comparison to a tsunami shows how quickly and on a large scale some people think AI could grow. Even though the term is a metaphor, it shows that many people and organisations may not fully understand how quickly things are changing, or the long-term consequences it could bring.","Dario amodei, ceo of leading ai company anthropic, said the world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence.

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

David Zaslav’s farewell message

The long-running battle between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has now taken a decisive turn. The WBD’s board deemed Paramount Skydance’s revised bid of $31 per share, all cash as superior to Netflix’s earlier offer of $27.75 per share for WBD’s studio and streaming assets. Paramount’s proposal covers the entirety of WBD, including pay-TV networks such as CNN, TBS, and TBT, and includes a $7 billion breakup fee to safeguard against regulatory hurdles.According to a report by CNBC, Netflix which had granted WBD a seven-day waiver to reopen talks with Paramount, chose not to revise its bid. In a joint statement, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said: “At the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match.” They emphasized that while Netflix believed it could have been a strong steward of Warner Bros. ’ iconic brands, the transaction was always a “nice to have” rather than a “must have.”WBD CEO David Zaslav has also acknowledged Netflix’s role on the process, saying: “Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future.”He added that once the board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create “tremendous value” for shareholders and usher in a new era of collaboration between Paramount Skydance and WBD.The market responded swiftly: Netflix shares jumped 10% in extended trading, Paramount gained 5%, while WBD fell 2%. Analysts noted that Netflix’s disciplined approach avoided overpaying, while Paramount’s aggressive bid underscored its determination to consolidate its position in the media landscape.","Paramount skydance's revised bid of $31 per share, all cash, deemed superior to netflix’s earlier offer of $27.75 per share.

Narayana Murthy highlights which jobs AI is likely to replace first



Why is the warning directed at young professionals



How AI is already affecting jobs



Skills that may remain important in an AI-driven workplace



Artificial intelligence has become one of the most discussed topics in India’s job and technology landscape, especially as automation tools are being adopted in offices, factories, and on digital platforms. At a time when concerns about work culture, productivity, and employment security are already in focus, fresh comments from Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy have drawn attention. In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, Murthy spoke about the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and skills, particularly for young people entering the workforce. His remarks come months after his comments on long working hours triggered widespread discussion. This time, the focus was on how quickly AI is moving forward and how it might change the way people work. The interview brought out his thoughts on being ready, learning new skills, and how young professionals should deal with a job market that is changing quickly because of new technologies.Murthy said in the interview that artificial intelligence is moving quickly and could take over some jobs sooner than most people think.He said that jobs that involve doing the same thing over and over or following a set pattern are more likely to be the first to be affected. According to him, AI systems are already capable of handling work that once required human intervention, especially in areas such as data processing, routine coding, and basic analysis.Murthy stated that this shift would not happen overnight but would gradually change how companies operate and hire. He noted that young professionals need to be aware of these changes early in their careers.Murthy’s comments focused largely on students and early-career workers. He said younger employees should understand that relying only on traditional degrees or narrow technical skills may not be enough in the long run. As AI tools get better, businesses may expect their employees to be able to solve more complex problems and know more about their field.The interview made it clear that being able to adapt and learn new things will be more and more important. Murthy said that young people who keep learning new things are more likely to stay useful as technology changes.AI is already being used in many fields, including finance, healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. AI-powered tools are answering customer service questions, writing software code, looking at financial data, and keeping track of supply chains.Technology news often cites industry reports that say companies are spending money on AI to make things run more smoothly and save money. This has made people worried about losing their jobs, especially in entry-level and routine positions. Murthy's comments fit with these changes, as he said that AI would change the way people work instead of getting rid of all jobs.Murthy said in the interview that skills like creativity, critical thinking, leadership, and decision-making are less likely to be done by machines. He said that people would still need to be involved in jobs that require understanding how people act, managing teams, or making tough decisions.He also mentioned that professionals who combine technical knowledge with real-world understanding could find more opportunities. This includes those who can work alongside AI systems rather than compete with them.","Narayana murthy spoke about the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and skills, particularly for young people entering the workforce.

The ‘December report’ that wiped $250 billion from its market value



Facebook parent company Meta is reportedly expanding its massive AI spending by striking a chip partnership with Google . Citing a report from The Information, news agency Reuters said that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company has signed a multi-billion dollar deal to rent Google’s specialised artificial intelligence (AI) chips to build its next generation of AI models. If true, this multi-year agreement comes days after the social media company announced a tie-up with AMD.Meta currently has deals with two of the biggest chipmakers: Nvidia and AMD. Earlier this week, AMD announced it would sell up to $60 billion worth of AI chips to Meta. The deal involves deploying up to 6 gigawatts of AI computing power to the social media giant’s next generation of AI infrastructure across multiple generations of AMD Instinct GPUs.Further, Meta recently signed another deal to buy Nvidia’s current and future high-end processors. The company is one of chipmaker's biggest customers, buying the GPUs to power key tasks such as the training of its AI models.The Information reported that beyond just renting, Meta is in talks to buy Google’s TPUs outright for its own data centres as early as next year. Notably, Google is the latest company to offer expanded access to its proprietary Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for external, third-party and corporate users.Google originally built these chips only for its own use, it is now renting them out to other companies. This shift has turned Google’s cloud business into a massive money-maker.While GPUs are used to train AI models, Google’s TPUs are used for inference – a term used to help AI models quickly make knowledge-based outputs at a lower cost.In December, a report claims that Meta Platforms was in advanced talks to spend billions on Google's competing AI chips. This hammered Nvidia's stock, erasing roughly $250 billion in market value. Nvidia issued a public statement defending its market position.“We're delighted by Google's success -- they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply to Google. Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry -- it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done,"" Nvidia wrote in a post on X.

Abu Dhabi's comprehensive approach to reducing dietary risks



Fast Food Faces Fresh Hurdle as Abu Dhabi Enforces Strict Ad Curbs

Challenges and the road ahead



No More Burger Billboards: Abu Dhabi Cracks Down on Junk Food Marketing





In a landmark shift toward proactive public health policy, Abu Dhabi has announced a comprehensive ban on outdoor advertising for junk food and unhealthy beverages across the emirate, marking one of the most ambitious food marketing restrictions in the region. This initiative, launched under the Healthy Living Abu Dhabi programme led by the Department of Health, aims to curtail the visibility of fast food and other nutritionally poor products in public spaces. It is a strategic effort to combat obesity, diabetes and other diet-related chronic diseases that strain individuals and the healthcare system.Under the new rules, any product deemed unhealthy based on strict nutritional thresholds, including high calories, fat, saturated fat, sodium or sugar, can no longer be advertised outdoors, whether on billboards, digital screens, street furniture or transport shelters. Products that meet healthier classifications (Grade A or B under Abu Dhabi’s SEHHI nutritional profile system) are the only ones allowed visibility in outdoor ads and even these must comply with detailed content criteria.The ban on junk food advertising forms part of a broader public health strategy designed to reshape the food environment, how food and drink are presented, marketed and consumed in everyday life.Officials from Healthy Living Abu Dhabi argue that reducing public exposure to unhealthy food adverts makes it easier for residents and visitors to make healthier choices in their daily routines. Dr Ahmed AlKhazraji, executive director of the programme, has emphasised that this policy is not about blaming individuals but about redesigning the environment so that healthful decisions become the default option.The comprehensive strategy also includes stricter nutritional standards in schools and workplaces, community fitness programmes and expanded public health awareness campaigns, all part of Abu Dhabi’s broader ambition to foster a healthier, more active society.Public health research increasingly highlights the role of food marketing in shaping consumption habits. Studies have shown that advertising exposure, especially for high-fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods, can influence cravings and dietary choices, particularly among children and adolescents. Similar advertising restrictions in other countries aim to reduce such exposure and encourage healthier eating patterns, though their effectiveness depends on comprehensive implementation and complementary measures.Abu Dhabi’s approach goes beyond merely limiting ads: it seeks to restructure how food is marketed and perceived in everyday settings. By removing ubiquitous outdoor promotion of unhealthy products, authorities aim to reduce impulse purchases and social normalization of poor dietary choices. A growing body of evidence suggests such environmental interventions may help lower obesity rates and reduce the burden of diet-related noncommunicable diseases, though outcomes will need to be tracked over time.The UAE emirate’s ban could significantly reduce visual cues that prompt unhealthy eating in public spaces. Public health advocates argue that environments saturated with fast-food promotions normalize high-calorie diets, contributing to rising obesity and chronic disease rates globally. By restricting this advertising, Abu Dhabi aims to promote a societal shift toward healthier living.This policy reflects a broader trend of governments taking a more assertive role in shaping food environments. Like policies restricting unhealthy food ads in other countries, Abu Dhabi’s initiative recognises that individual choice is influenced by marketing and visibility. By tackling the “foodscape” itself rather than only individual behaviour, the emirate is aiming for a cultural shift in how health and diet are understood and communicated.For food and beverage companies, the ban means rethinking outdoor marketing strategies in one of the UAE’s most influential emirates. Traditional advertising channels like billboards, street signage and outdoor displays will no longer serve as platforms for unhealthy products. Brands will need to pivot toward permissible channels or reformulate products to meet healthier categories under the Nutri-Mark system. This change represents both a regulatory challenge and an opportunity to innovate in product development and marketing.While this advertising ban is broad and ambitious, some public health experts caution that ad restrictions must be part of a broader, multipronged strategy that includes education, accessibility to healthy foods and ongoing monitoring to realise measurable health improvements. Similar policies elsewhere have faced critiques that without supportive measures, such as price incentives, school nutrition improvements and restrictions on digital ads, advertising bans alone may have limited effects.Nonetheless, by embedding public health considerations into everyday environments, from billboards to supermarket aisles, Abu Dhabi’s policy could set a precedent for how cities and nations approach preventive health policy in the 21st century. Abu Dhabi has banned outdoor advertising of junk food and unhealthy beverages as part of its Healthy Living programme.Products exceeding strict nutritional thresholds are no longer allowed on billboards, street ads or public displays, under a system tied to Nutri-Mark classifications. The policy complements broader public health efforts, including supermarket layout changes and school nutrition rules. Officials aim to shift societal norms around diet and reduce the burden of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.","Abu dhabi has announced a comprehensive ban on outdoor advertising for junk food and unhealthy beverages across the emirate.

UAE Unveils World's First AI-Powered Sovereign Cloud to Guard Banks and Data

What makes the UAE's sovereign financial cloud revolutionary



Implications for the UAE and global financial landscape



What UAE's sovereign financial cloud platform means for everyday users and institutions



More secure banking services with enhanced protections.

Better digital experiences built on real-time insights.

Faster product rollouts as institutions leverage automated, AI-powered infrastructure.

Greater confidence in data privacy and national sovereignty





In a bold leap that could redefine how modern financial systems operate, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (CBUAE) has announced the launch of what it calls the world’s first sovereign financial cloud services infrastructure, a secure and AI-powered digital backbone designed specifically for the nation’s financial sector. This initiative, developed in partnership with Core42 (a subsidiary of AI and technology group G42), aims to position the UAE at the forefront of secure, sovereign digital finance and bolster its reputation as a global hub for innovative financial services.The platform, known as the Sovereign Financial Cloud Services Infrastructure (SFCSI), is set apart from traditional cloud environments by its focus on data sovereignty, integrated cybersecurity and unified multi-cloud management, all underpinned by advanced artificial intelligence and real-time analytics. In practical terms, this means the UAE’s financial sector will be able to process, analyse and automate critical banking functions with unprecedented speed and regulatory control, securely within national borders.Unlike most cloud services, which are operated by global providers and often host data far from the jurisdictions that regulate them, the SFCSI is built on a fully isolated and centralised infrastructure that ensures critical financial data remains within the UAE’s legal and security perimeter.Governments and regulators see this as key not just for privacy but for economic and strategic sovereignty in a world where data and finance increasingly intersect.This approach mirrors broader global trends toward digital sovereignty, where countries aim to protect sensitive infrastructure from foreign interference, whether from geopolitical tensions or shifting international data laws. By embedding regulatory controls and governance tools directly into the cloud platform itself, the CBUAE is seeking to reduce reliance on foreign systems and strengthen confidence in the nation’s financial resilience.Core42’s involvement is not just as a technical builder; the partnership brings integrated artificial intelligence and advanced analytics directly into the financial backbone. This allows licensed financial institutions and the CBUAE to automate operational processes intelligently, analyse real-time data for risk and performance insights, improve decision-making with predictive models and enhance customer service through automated, data-driven workflows.In a world where financial services are rapidly becoming more complex and interconnected, AI integration at the infrastructure level offers both competitive edge and stronger defences against threats like fraud, system failure or cyber-attacks. The new system also provides a single management framework for multiple cloud services, giving licensed financial institutions the flexibility to administer a range of cloud environments, including private and hybrid setups, seamlessly and securely. This capability is particularly valuable for institutions that need to balance agility and innovation with strict regulatory compliance.For the UAE’s banks, insurers and fintech startups, the SFCSI represents a foundational piece of digital transformation. Regulatory oversight will be more immediate and nuanced, while institutions can scale new digital products, from personalised banking apps to smart payment systems, without compromising on security or compliance.Officials from the CBUAE emphasised that the platform will serve the entire licensed financial sector, reinforcing not just operational resilience but also long-term sustainable growth as financial services evolve. The central bank’s leadership views this as a pivotal step in strengthening the nation’s competitiveness on the world stage.The UAE’s move toward a sovereign financial cloud resonates with a broader global push for digital control over critical infrastructure. Various countries are debating how to balance openness to global technology with the need to protect sensitive financial and governmental data, a tension that’s only grown more pronounced as cyber threats increase and geopolitical competition around tech intensifies. By being among the first to embed sovereign control, AI capabilities and cloud innovation at this scale, the UAE is signalling that it intends to lead in secure, regulated digital finance, not just participate in it.While this cloud platform is targeted at the financial sector, its development aligns with the UAE’s wider strategy of integrating AI and digital infrastructure across governance, public services and enterprise systems. The inclusion of AI, real-time analytics and automation at a national infrastructure level could help catalyse further technological development in related fields such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), national payments innovation and cross-border financial integration.For banks and financial firms, the SFCSI offers a more efficient way to innovate and comply with regulations, potentially making services faster, more secure and easier to tailor to customer needs. For consumers and businesses, the shift could translate into:The rollout of such an infrastructure may also attract international finance players, tech investors and startups looking to base operations in a secure, innovation-friendly jurisdiction.

Extension requests allowed, but not guaranteed



Penalties for overstaying







Vehicles bearing Gulf plates will soon face a firm time limit inside Saudi Arabia. Under new rules approved by the Saudi government, cars registered in any Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country can no longer remain in the Kingdom beyond 90 days within a 365-day period.The decision was issued by the Saudi Council of Ministers, which framed regulations to control how long GCC-registered vehicles may stay in the country. The 90-day cap applies whether the stay is consecutive or split across multiple visits. The countdown begins from the date the vehicle enters Saudi Arabia through any customs port.The regulations cover vehicles registered in GCC countries and owned by Saudi citizens, expatriates, or individuals authorized to drive them inside the Kingdom. However, cars rented from licensed rental establishments in GCC member states are excluded from the rule.Authorities say the move is intended to regulate vehicle usage and curb violations linked to cars remaining in Saudi Arabia for extended periods without local registration.Vehicle owners or authorized drivers may request an extension before the 90-day period expires. Applications must be submitted to the Ministry of Interior, which will review each request at its discretion and outline the required procedures and documentation.Implementation will involve coordination between government bodies. The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority will supply the Ministry of Interior with necessary vehicle data. Owners or authorized drivers are required to register vehicle details at the customs port in line with the authority’s requirements upon entry.The regulations make clear that exceeding the permitted stay will trigger penalties under Article 68, Paragraph 5 of the Saudi Traffic Law, as overstaying constitutes a traffic violation.The governor of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority is expected to issue the executive decisions needed to activate the framework, in coordination with the Ministry of Interior.The new measures formalize what officials describe as a structured approach to monitoring foreign-registered vehicles and preventing prolonged stays without proper compliance.",Cars registered in any gulf cooperation council (gcc) country can no longer remain in the kingdom beyond 90 days within a 365-day period.

Shoes outside! Silicon Valley startups adopt desi habit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shoes-outside-silicon-valley-startups-adopt-desi-habit/articleshow/128866735.cms,"



A viral photo from San Francisco has set social media abuzz — and no, it’s not AI generated. The image shows multiple pairs of shoes neatly lined up outside an office door. The location? Cursor, the AI startup founded in 2022 by four MIT alumni — Aman Sanger, Michael Truell, Sualeh Asif and Arvid Lunnemark.Yes, you read that right. Employees are being asked to leave their shoes outside before entering the office. And Cursor isn’t alone.Startups such as Replo, Spur, Speak, Flowhub and Composite are also encouraging staff to ditch their Vans and Uggs at the door. What sounds like a page out of an Indian household rulebook — “chappals bahar rakho” — is quietly becoming a trend in America’s tech capital.According to an NYT report, workers at Spur, which uses AI to check websites for bugs, are given slides to wear inside their office in Manhattan, and guests are asked to do the same. Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the chief executive, told NYT the no-shoes policy “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees and “disarms you in a positive way”.Growing up in an Indian family in Singapore, she often removed shoes in homes and temples to “show respect for a space.” That slippered employees don’t drag in dirt and mud from the street is a “plus point,” she said.Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, said the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action”.That is, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them. Here’s the irony: while removing footwear is customary in Indian homes and temples, it’s rare — almost unheard of — in corporate offices.Even in Bengaluru’s startup corridors, no one expects you to park your sneakers outside the glass door.","A viral photo from san francisco has set social media abuzz.

This results in entries such as “No Name Given Ankur,” “No Name Given Anjali,” or “No Name Given Anil. ”The claim was made in an audio shared on X by MAGA activist Savanah Hernandez, where she described a review of the USDOT (Department of Transportation) company census file, which contains over two million entries.“These are all trucking companies that have been registered, and this is their contact name,” the first speaker in the audio says.The exchange continues with the second person confirming the scope of the claim.“And each individual one is a trucking company here in the US,” the second speaker says.“Yes, on the USDOT record, there is a primary officer. And this is the person that owns the trucking company and is responsible for the paperwork, one of the two. This is where all of these names came from. And so I pulled the list from, it’s the file for the company census file at the USDOT, two point something million rows.And so I pulled everyone that included no given name, first name unknown, last name unknown. It’s a lot, and with the no given name, I searched it on the corporate filings, it’s only trucking companies that have this. ”In the recording, the second speaker clarifies the practical implications of these registrations.“And again, I just want to clarify, these are the primary contacts of these companies here in the US. These people have active trucking companies.”“Yes,” the first speaker responds and agrees.The audio concludes with the suggestion that companies registered in this way are able to operate heavy trucks on American highways which might be dangerous for American citizens.It says: “And can actively have 18 wheelers or semis on US interstates.”Hernandez’s post said the problem came from years of alleged negligence by the US Department of Transportation (DOT). She suggested the issue started when migrants who crossed the border illegally did not give their full names to Border Patrol, which led to “No Name Given” entries on official paperwork.","Conservative activist savanah hernandez claims trucking companies in the united states are registered under the name “no name given. ” she said the situation is linked to migrants, particularly from the punjabi community, who do not provide their full names to us authorities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128863836,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-151396,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Immigrant engineer to Silicon Valley mentor: Indian American self-made millionaire reveals his ultimate success blueprint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/immigrant-engineer-to-silicon-valley-mentor-indian-american-self-made-millionaire-reveals-his-ultimate-success-blueprint/articleshow/128834291.cms,"How This Indian American Millionaire Broke Barriers And Is Now Teaching Others to Win

The Ground Breaker

Kanwal Rekhi: From humble beginnings to high tech



The Ground Breaker: Kanwal Rekhi's book born of lessons and purpose

Takeaways from Kanwal Rekhi's success story







At 80 years old, Kanwal Rekhi, a self-made Indian-American millionaire, Silicon Valley pioneer and mentor to thousands, has chronicled his remarkable rise and lifelong mission to empower others in a new book titled. The memoir, released on February 23, 2026, charts Rekhi’s journey from a young graduate student in Michigan to the first Indian-American founder to take a venture-backed company public on the NASDAQ, then goes further, sharing the hard-earned lessons he now uses to help other entrepreneurs thrive.Rekhi’s story embodies classic elements of the American Dream including discipline, innovation and resilience but it is his dedication to lifting others that defines his legacy today. Despite facing early cultural barriers in the tech world, Rekhi went on not only to build and lead successful ventures like Excelan, a networking pioneer in Silicon Valley, but also to co-found TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), a global organisation that supports and mentors entrepreneurs around the world. Through TiE, he has invested in over 200 startups and counselled more than 10,000 founders, a testament to his belief that success is most meaningful when shared.Rekhi’s entrepreneurial arc began when he moved from Bombay (now Mumbai), India, to pursue a master’s degree in engineering at Michigan Tech in the late 1960s. After a stint supplying computers to NASA and working on flight-simulator technology for the US Air Force and Navy, Rekhi realised traditional corporate ladders offered limited opportunities for Indian-American engineers at that time.Undeterred, he bet on himself, launching Excelan at a time when the idea of networking computers was still cutting-edge.Under his leadership, Excelan grew rapidly and five years after its founding, Rekhi made history by taking the company public on the NASDAQ, a major milestone for non-white tech founders in the US. His success broke ceilings and helped reshape expectations for immigrant entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley long before multicultural leadership became a rallying cry.The Ground Breaker, Rekhi’s memoir, is not just a narrative of success; it is a guide to mindset and perseverance. Drawing on decades of experience, he advocates for qualities like humility, adaptive leadership and continuous learning. One of his key messages, that you need to prove your worth even if no one initially believes in you, resonates deeply with aspiring entrepreneurs who face doubt or lack of access to traditional paths.What makes The Ground Breaker particularly compelling is how Rekhi balances personal trials with practical wisdom. He openly discusses the loneliness of forging new paths when mentors and role models are scarce and how creating supportive structures like TiE became an answer to that gap. The book blends memoir with mentorship, offering readers not only a story but also insights they can apply to their ventures and lives.Beyond the book, Rekhi’s ongoing work with TiE and other mentoring efforts demonstrate his commitment to pay forward the opportunities he carved out. By investing in startups across sectors, from early-stage tech to scalable innovations, he has helped founders navigate challenges that once hampered his own early career. His mentorship is not theoretical but deeply grounded in real business experience, often focused on helping others avoid the setbacks he encountered.Rekhi’s journey reflects a broader trend in the entrepreneurial ecosystem where seasoned founders become ecosystem builders, not just investors. This community-oriented approach empowers the next generation of innovators to scale ideas faster and with more support than previous generations had. It is a cycle of innovation and contribution that has implications far beyond Silicon Valley, resonating in cities and startup hubs worldwide.What makes Rekhi’s book and mission particularly relevant in 2026 is the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship itself. Economies around the world are recognising that diversity in leadership drives better outcomes and stories like Rekhi’s showcase how immigrant founders have historically contributed disproportionately to breakthrough innovation.In an era overflowing with business advice, personal narratives that pair authentic experience with actionable strategies, like The Ground Breaker, offer guidance that feels both relatable and grounded. Rekhi’s transition from founder to mentor reflects a growing consensus that entrepreneurial success is not a solo sport; it thrives within networks of support, capital access and shared knowledge, a trend increasingly visible in global startup ecosystems.Kanwal Rekhi’s book The Ground Breaker encapsulates his journey from immigrant student to NASDAQ-listed tech founder and now mentor to thousands. His story reflects innovation, resilience and the importance of mentorship in building sustainable entrepreneurial communities. Through organisations like TiE, Rekhi continues to empower founders and investors alike, multiplying his impact far beyond his own ventures. His message resonates in a world where inclusive support and shared knowledge increasingly define how and why success happens.","Kanwal rekhi is the first indian-american founder to take a venture-backed company public on the nasdaq.

East India Company is wound up for a second time in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/east-india-company-is-wound-up-for-a-second-time-in-london/articleshow/128826852.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





The first time the East India Company (EIC) was formally dissolved was in 1874, as result of the 1857 First War of Independence when Indian soldiers from the company revolted. It was effectively abolished in 1858 when its control of India was transferred to the British Raj operating from a new India Office in Whitehall and its forces became the British Indian Army. For a second time, the EIC in London, surprisingly revived by a Mumbai businessman, is being wound up. It has gone into voluntary liquidation owing £1 million.Filings at Companies House show that it owes £611,279 (Rs 7.5 crore) to its parent company, the EIC Group, in the British Virgin Islands; £163,105 (Rs 2 crore) in wages to staff and £193,789 (Rs 2.4 crore) to the UK taxman. Its assets amount to just £60.39 (Rs 7,439.)CEO Sanjiv Mahendra Mehta bought the rights and assets, such as the coat of arms, of the original EIC from a group of shareholders in 2005. In 2010, after investing £10 million, he turned it into a luxury lifestyle brand selling fine Asian foods, tea, chocolates, jewellery, coins and homeware — with an Eastern theme.Born into a Gujarati Jain family in Mumbai, Mehta, now British, comes from a lineage of diamond traders.An alumnus of Sydenham College, Mumbai and IIM Ahmedabad, he moved to the UK in 1989. His vision was to once again turn the EIC into a global commercial venture trading from London. His company’s branding spoke of “retaining the pioneering spirit and merchant mindset that defined its formation”.In 2010 the company opened its flagship store in Mayfair; this later moved to Bond Street. At the time Mehta had said: “I am Indian, so there is a huge feeling of redemption for me. It is buying back a company that owned India.” The store now lies empty, and the website has disappeared.In 2023 Mehta launched an enormous collectible coin called “the Crown”, made of 3.6kg of gold and 6,426 diamonds, to mark the first anniversary of the Queen’s death.Whilst the original EIC plundered India, this company has sunk owing money to the British.","The first time the east india company (eic) was formally dissolved was in 1874.
