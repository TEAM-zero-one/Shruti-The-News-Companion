"Review petition can't be allowed as 'appeal in disguise', rules Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/review-petition-cant-be-allowed-as-appeal-in-disguise-rules-supreme-court/articleshow/123798289.cms,"Supreme Court

Supreme Court has reiterated that proceedings initiated to review a judgment should not be confused with appeal proceedings. A bench of Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah and S V N Bhatti cautioned that courts ought not mix up review jurisdiction with appellate jurisdiction. It said that a review petition has a limited purpose and could not be permitted to function as an appeal in disguise.""The review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC. Review is not to be confused with appellate powers, which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court. In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 of CPC, it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected,"" the court said.",Supreme court has reiterated that proceedings initiated to review a judgment should not be confused with appeal proceedings.

WHO adds key weight-loss drugs to essential meds list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-adds-key-weight-loss-drugs-to-essential-meds-list/articleshow/123798126.cms,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization (WHO) has included popular weight-loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide, sold in India under the brand name Wegovy and Mounjaro, respectively, in its Model List of Essential Medicines (EML).This is important because the WHO's model list of essential medicines serves as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance, and reimbursement schemes in over 150 countries, including India.If India adopts the list, it could pave the way for a sharp reduction in the prices of these drugs in the future.Currently, Wegovy, one of the most popular weight loss drugs, costs anywhere between Rs 17,000 and Rs 26,000 per month depending on the dosage. Mounjaro, another blockbuster weight-loss drug, costs anywhere between Rs 14,000 and Rs 27,000 per month depending on dosage and the route of administration. Vials are cheaper compared to Kwikpens, a pre-filled, disposable device that contains medication.According to the WHO, the high prices of drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are limiting access to these medicines. ""Prioritising those who would benefit most, encouraging generic competition to drive down prices and making these treatments available in primary care - especially in underserved areas - are key to expanding access and improving health outcomes,"" the UN health body has said.Diabetes and obesity are two of the most urgent health challenges facing the world today. In India, studies suggest, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has gone up by over five times in the last 30 years - from approximately 53 million people in 1990 to 235 million in 2021.If action is not taken to curb this growing public health challenge, a recent study published in The Lancet warned, the overweight or obesity prevalence in the country may go up to over 520 million (projected figure) - the second highest globally.As part of broader efforts to reduce inequities in cancer care, the expert committee of WHO has also recommended increasing access to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.","The world health organization has included popular weight-loss drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide in its model list of essential medicines. The who's model list of essential medicines serves as a basis for public sector procurement, supply of medicines and health insurance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123798233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-13952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Aishwarya moves Delhi HC seeking protection of personality rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aishwarya-moves-delhi-hc-seeking-protection-of-personality-rights/articleshow/123797051.cms,"NEW DELHI: Actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan moved Delhi HC on Tuesday seeking to protect her personality rights and restrain online platforms from illegally using her name and images, and also AI-generated pornographic content.Justice Tejas Karia indicated that he would pass an ad interim order cautioning the defendants, and agreed to examine the suit that seeks to prevent misappropriation of various aspects of Aishwarya's personality, including her name, image, likeness, persona, and voice, from commercial misuse.""There can be no right in their favour to use her images, likeness or persona.

This is unfortunate,"" said advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing the actor.He said T-shirts and mugs with the actor's images are being sold illegally.

J.J. McCarthy’s Football Journey

J.J. McCarthy net worth, salary and NFL contracts

J.J. McCarthy’s endorsements and brand deals

J.J. McCarthy’s future in NFL

J.J. McCarthy is a rising football quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings. In 2025, his net worth is about $2 million. Most of this money comes from his NFL contract and endorsement deals with top brands. J.J. 's journey from high school talent to NFL starter shows how hard work, discipline, and smart choices can bring success both on the field and off it, even at a very young age.J.J. McCarthy grew up in Illinois and began playing football when he was very young. He later moved to IMG Academy, where he gained national attention. After high school, he joined the University of Michigan and became one of the most talked-about college quarterbacks. In 2023, he helped Michigan win the national championship, which boosted his profile before entering the NFL Draft.In 2024, the Minnesota Vikings selected J.J. with the 10th overall pick in the first round. Fans had high hopes, but his first season took a setback when he tore his meniscus and missed the entire year. Now, in 2025, he is back healthy, starting for the Vikings, and proving why he was such a top draft choice.As of 2025, J.J. McCarthy’s net worth is around $2 million. The biggest part of this comes from his rookie contract. He signed a four-year deal worth $21.85 million, and the contract is fully guaranteed. He also received a $12.7 million signing bonus, which he got right away when he signed with the team.In 2024, even though he did not play due to injury, J.J. still earned about $13.5 million, mostly from the signing bonus. For the 2025 season, his base salary is $960,000, along with a roster bonus of $828,400. This means J.J. will make nearly $1.8 million from his NFL salary this year alone.Also Read: Houston Texans Fan In J.J. Watt Jersey Left Bloodied After Shocking Fight With Los Angeles Rams Fans At SoFi Stadium Like many young NFL stars, J.J. is also making money away from football. He has signed endorsement deals with big companies. His partners include Topps, Bose, Dunkin, Alo Yoga, Essentia Water, and Panini. These deals not only increase his income but also make him more popular among fans.Even before entering the NFL, J.J. had several NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) deals in college. Reports said he sometimes earned over $1 million per year while playing at Michigan. Now in the NFL, these brand deals are expected to grow as he plays more games and becomes a bigger star for the Vikings.J.J. McCarthy is still at the very start of his professional career. With his talent, strong arm, and ability to lead his team, he has the potential to become one of the best young quarterbacks in the league. His current net worth of $2 million is just the beginning. If he continues to play well, his future contracts will be even larger, and his endorsement deals will increase too.For fans of the Vikings and the NFL, J.J.’s story is one to watch closely. He has already shown resilience by coming back from injury, and his journey proves that success in sports comes from patience, dedication, and smart financial planning.","J.j. mccarthy is a rising football quarterback for the minnesota vikings.

As global mobility continues to rise, the United Arab Emirates, particularly Dubai , has positioned itself as a hub for professionals, entrepreneurs, and remote workers. With 88% of its population made up of expats, the UAE offers a range of visa options tailored to different work profiles. Whether you're employed by a local company, working remotely for a foreign firm, freelancing, or investing, understanding the UAE’s four main work-related visa pathways, Standard, Remote Work, Green, and Golden, is essential for anyone considering relocating to the country.The standard work visa is the most common pathway for foreign nationals working in the UAE across private, government, and free zone sectors. It’s an employer-sponsored visa, usually issued for two to three years, and is renewable.There’s no maximum age for applicants. However, if the worker is over 65, the employer pays an additional AED 5,000 (USD 1,360) every two years.The UAE’s Remote Work Visa, also known as the Virtual Work Program in Dubai, allows foreign professionals to reside in the UAE while working for a non-UAE-based employer. This is ideal for digital nomads or remote professionals looking for a base in the Gulf region.The Dubai Virtual Work Program also allows remote workers to bring their families with them.Introduced to attract global talent and support flexible employment models, the Green Visa separates the work permit from the residency permit. It provides a 5-year residence, without the need for an employer sponsor, and grants extended grace periods of up to 6 months post-expiry to stay in the UAE.The Golden Visa is a prestigious long-term residence permit valid for 5 or 10 years, designed to retain investors, top professionals, and exceptional talent. It comes with multiple privileges that go beyond typical work visas.Each category has specific application procedures and approval criteria, and applicants must meet the exacting standards laid out by UAE authorities.","Anyone over 18 can work legally in the uae, with no maximum age limit.

Xbox Cloud Gaming Now Available in Cars: Microsoft and LG's Game-Changing Partnership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-available-in-cars-microsoft-and-lgs-game-changing-partnership/articleshow/123785942.cms,"Xbox and LG put Cloud Gaming on the road

For years, gaming has been something you do at home, on your PC, console, or maybe on your phone. But now, Microsoft and LG are changing the way we think about where games can be played. In an exciting partnership, the two companies are bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming directly to cars.Imagine sitting in the backseat during a long drive and loading up Forza Horizon 5 or Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 while the miles roll by outside. With the Xbox app built into LG’s Automotive Content Platform (ACP), select internet-connected vehicles like the Kia EV3, EV5, EV6, and even the new Sportage will let passengers stream and play their favorite titles on the go.All you need is internet access, an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and a Bluetooth controller. Henceforth, a car ride might not be just a journey, it can be a whole new gaming session.The collaboration between Microsoft and LG signals a major step in expanding the reach of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Already available on PCs, smartphones, and smart TVs, the service is now hitting the road, literally. This marks the first time Xbox Cloud Gaming is being directly integrated into a car’s infotainment system.The system works through LG’s Automotive Content Platform (ACP), the same webOS-based ecosystem that powers their smart TVs. In supported vehicles like the Kia EV3, passengers can open the Xbox app, log into their account, and stream games directly from the cloud.Since it’s powered by Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the library includes blockbuster titles such as Gears of War Reloaded, The Outer Worlds 2, and the ever-popular Forza Horizon 5, an almost poetic experience when you’re playing inside a moving vehicle.Of course, cloud gaming requires a few basics. A stable internet connection is essential since all games are streamed rather than installed. A compatible Bluetooth controller is also needed, ensuring the experience feels just like playing on a console. Once connected, players can carry their progress across devices, making it possible to pick up right where they left off at home.Beyond simple entertainment, this innovation highlights Xbox’s ongoing mission to make gaming more accessible. As Christopher Lee, Xbox’s vice president of marketing, explained, this is about giving players more choices in how and where they play. Whether you’re killing time during a road trip or passing the moments while charging your EV, gaming now fits into the driving lifestyle.The partnership also makes sense for car manufacturers like Kia. With EVs becoming hubs of digital living, adding immersive entertainment options helps make long journeys or charging breaks far more engaging. It’s easy to see this becoming a selling point for families or tech-savvy drivers.This move also shows how the definition of portability in gaming is changing. Where once you needed a handheld device like the ROG Ally or Steam Deck, now all you need is a car, a screen, and an internet connection. For many players, the backseat could become the newest gaming lounge, blurring the line between travel and play.","Xbox and lg put cloud gaming on the road with the kia ev3, ev5, ev6, and even the new sportage. All you need is internet access, an xbox game pass ultimate subscription, and a bluetooth controller.

How much is Keon Coleman’s massive diamond chain really worth?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-much-is-keon-colemans-massive-diamond-chain-really-worth/articleshow/123793955.cms,"Keon Coleman (Image Source: Getty)

Keon Coleman’s flashy jewelry ignites social media frenzy

The massive diamond chain raises questions about authenticity

Buffalo Bills wide receiver Keon Coleman set social media on fire when fans noticed the massive diamond chain he was wearing, which fans are estimating could cost in excess of $200,000. That crazy-massive, bold piece has rapidly gone viral in tattoo circles, prompting much speculation over what it'll cost. That said, no credible sources have verified the chatter online, and it remains unconfirmed just how much Coleman paid for the chain or what value it actually holds.Keon Coleman had his big bling-cap on in one of the most recent posts, so blingy that it went viral the other day. Social media erupted with fans and followers praising the craftsmanship and the sheer size of the chain. The jewelry was featured on influencer accounts and NFL fan pages, where the public debated its price point, designer, and whether it was genuine or just custom-made.That flashy look matched Coleman’s rapidly emerging reputation as one of the most engaging newcomers in the league. Unless we are talking about the online buzz, the news has not been confirmed either by reliable sources or by the player, which keeps the story only on speculation.Major sports media outlets had yet to report the matter, despite bold claims of value in the hundreds of thousands for the chain. The bulk of the talk stays in the realm of fan conjecture and social media chatter. Some fans were surprised, while others were doubtful, hinting that the jewelry could be an expensive costume design instead of a multi-million dollar piece.Chain value without independent verification is still unknown. Either way, the viral reactions underscore how rapidly a single photo or clip of video grabs the attention of the NFL world and beyond.Keon Coleman has caught everyone's eye, not just for his play on the field, but now with what many are branding a showstopping diamond chain. The hype talks about a luxury object worth hundreds of thousands, but it still has to be verified. The origin, styles, and costs of the chain are presumably speculation until Coleman or his camp formally confirms anything.","Buffalo bills wide receiver keon coleman set social media on fire when fans noticed the massive diamond chain he was wearing.

Read Apple founder Steve Jobs email to himself here



From: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com To: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com

Date: Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 11:08PM

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Sent from my iPad

Apple founder Steve Jobs wrote a personal and moving email to himself just a year before his death. The email which offers a glimpse into the mind of the Apple visionary has now resurfaced online. The messages was sent from his official Apple email ID and was never intended for the public view, but it is now being shared via the Steve Jobs Archive .Apple founder Steve Jobs sent the email from his iPad to his own Apple ID on September 2, 2010. In the email sent, Jobs talked about the fundamental aspects of his existence that he did not create himself. Along with this, the email also mention the countless ways his life was shaped by contributions of others. “I grow little of the food I eat… I speak a language I did not invent or refine… I am moved by music I did not create myself… I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being,” wrote Jobs.The message highlights that Jobs acknowledged the invisible network of human effort—past and present—that sustains modern life. The email concludes with a powerful and heartfelt statement that stands in stark contrast to the often-portrayed image of Jobs as a singular, self-made genius: ""I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.""The email is now available for public via the Steve Jobs Archive. It is a project launched by Laurene Powell Jobs, Tim Cook, and Jony Ive to preserve and share the legacy of Apple’s co-founder.","Apple founder steve jobs sent the email from his ipad to his own apple id on september 2, 2010.

Nearly half a decade after their debut, AirPods Pro are getting refreshed for the third time, three years after their last outing. Apple has added a heart sensor, improved the sound, and enhanced the active noise cancellation.Apple says they've redesigned the airflow system inside the earbuds that widens the sound stage. The ear tips are now foam-infused, doubling the noise cancellation compared to the previous generation AirPods Pro. Apple says the difference is ""night-and-day"" when compared to the original AirPods Pro from 2019.The AirPods Pro 3 , in Apple's words, are the ""best fitting AirPods ever."" Apple said it analysed tens of thousands of ears and made each earbud smaller to fit ear canals better. To ensure a better fit, Apple will be shipping five sizes of ear tips with these. They're now also IP57 sweat and water resistant.The ""awe-dropping"" moment of the AirPods Pro 3 is the new heart sensor, which uses a custom photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that ""shines invisible infrared light pulsed at 256 times per second to measure light absorption in blood flow."" It's the smallest sensor from Apple ever.The heart rate sensor, when paired with AirPods Pro's other sensors like accelerometers, gyroscope, and GPS, can track heart rate, calories burned, and activity (supporting up to 50 workouts). These advanced computational models work in tandem with Apple Intelligence on iPhone, and you can see all the tracked stats in the Fitness app (just like you do with Apple Watch).Workout Buddy, which is an iOS 26 feature, can make the best use of this technology and counts as one of the Apple Intelligence features. The other is Live Translation, which Apple says will help you converse with people in different languages naturally.When using Live Translation, the noise cancellation lowers the volume of the speaker so you can hear the translation clearly. That's also an example of the improved Transparency mode. So the other person knows what you're saying, you can show the live transcription on your iPhone placed horizontally, like a heads-up display.Apple says that AirPods Pro 3 will last 8 hours, up from 6 hours on the previous AirPods Pro, with ANC turned on. For those using them as hearing aids, these should last up to 10 hours.AirPods Pro 3 are priced at $249.

MUMBAI: Former RBI executive director G Padmanabhan on Monday said govt needs to quickly take a stand on stablecoins, warning against allowing regulatory uncertainty to drift like in the case of crypto.Speaking at a curtain raiser for Global Fintech Festival 2025, Padmanabhan, now an advisor to the Payments Council of India, said India cannot ignore global developments, particularly after the US has moved ahead with its e-currency framework. ""Stablecoin is quite a different proposition from crypto, and India as part of the global ecosystem has to take a view one way or the other very quickly,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: In a significant development for the country's seafood industry, the European Union (EU) has listed 102 new Indian fishery units for export from India to EU member countries. The move comes amid the backdrop of stiff tariffs imposed by the US, which is expected to hurt the country's shrimp exports and lead to job losses.The EU's decision is likely to offset some of that impact, with the new establishments finding new markets in EU, a move that is expected to help in the diversification of the country's seafood exports.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

What is the HIRE Act?



Creates a 25% tax on outsourcing payments, defined as any money paid by a U.S. company or taxpayer to a foreign person whose work benefits consumers in the United States. Creates a 'Domestic Workforce Fund' to collect any money raised from the outsourcing tax, which is used to support apprenticeships and workforce development programs. Prohibits companies from deducting any outsourcing payments.

How will the HIRE Act impact India, if passed?







Amid MAGA talks of taxing companies for hiring foreign workers or banning them from hiring Indians, senator Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) has introduced the HIRE Act (Halting International Relocation of Employment), vowing protection of American workers from jobs getting outsourced by US companies.The Act, introduced on September 5, proposes to introduce a 25 per cent tax on outsourcing payments, meaning any money paid by a US company or taxpayer to a foreign person whose work benefits consumers in the United States.“While college grads in America struggle to find work, globalist politicians and C-Suite executives have spent decades shipping good-paying jobs overseas in pursuit of slave wages and immense profits – those days are over,” said Moreno. “It’s time to fight for working class Americans and ensure they can work and retire with dignity. If companies want to hire foreign workers instead of Americans, my bill will hit them where it hurts: their pocketbooks. ”Money raised by the penalty on spending on overseas workers will be used to support apprenticeship programs in the United States as well as workforce development programs, the Act proposes.HIRE Act is only a proposed Act and it may not get passed in its existing form. A 25% tax on outsourcing will raise costs significantly, threatening India’s major export: IT and business process services. If the Act is passed, US firms would be forced to shift work onshore to get relief from the additional tax.","Hire act proposes 25% tax on companies for hiring foreign workers.
