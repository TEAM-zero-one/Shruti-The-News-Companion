BSF IG Warns Of Looming Threat As 120 Terrorists Wait In PoK Despite Dip In Infiltration Attempts

NEW DELHI: Intelligence agencies are alarmed and closely monitoring the expansion of terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Satellite imagery and photographs reveal the construction of a new ""dual-use facility"" in the Neelum Valley district.Since November, LeT accelerated the infrastructure build-up of the new centre, named ""Jamia Masjid Ibn Taymiyah wa Markaz,"" being erected in the Sharda area. This facility, sources said, was explicitly designed to function simultaneously as both a religious structure and a command-and-control centre for terrorist activities, raising acute concerns about the deepening entrenchment of terrorist operations in the region.""The project's operational significance was underscored by the recent visit and inspection of the Neelum Valley site by Rizwan Hanif, the Deputy of LeT's PoK unit,"" the source added. According to intelligence sources, this facility is one of four major Markaz (centres) currently under construction by LeT across PoK, with others planned for DhirKot, Bagh; Khaigala, Rawalakot; and Palandri, Sudhanoti.These parallel projects signal a coordinated effort by LeT to dramatically expand its logistical and ideological footprint across the territory while shifting a major chunk of its resources to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.The strategy is to create multiple small infrastructures instead of a massive centralised Markaz. Rawalakot has emerged as another major construction hub for terror infrastructure. Many launchpads here were destroyed by the Indian Army in Operation Sindoor.LeT is now readying terrorist launch pads at these locations under the guise of mosques. ""A huge building is being constructed in the Khaigala area of Rawalakot which will act as a launchpad but in reality, this is again a dual-use facility, named Al-Aqsa Markaz. LeT is attempting to portray it as a mosque. LeT's PoK spokesperson, Aamir Zia, recently released a video initially referring to it as a mosque, but accidentally called it a Markaz during the conversation,"" a source added.","Satellite imagery and photographs reveal the construction of a new ""dual-use facility"" in the neelum valley district.

"Sule pushes for work-life balance, brings bill on employees’ right to disconnect",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sule-pushes-for-work-life-balance-brings-bill-on-employees-right-to-disconnect/articleshow/125993156.cms,".

New Delhi: Bringing into focus the importance of work-life balance in the digital era, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule has introduced a private member’s bill in Lok Sabha proposing establishing an ‘employees welfare authority’ to confer the right on employees to disconnect from work-related phone calls & e-mails beyond work hours and on holidays.“Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025, fosters a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing burnout caused by today’s digital culture,” Sule had said on X after the bill was introduced on Dec 5. Friday is reserved for private member’s bills in Parliament.The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ of the bill says: “According to a report released by World Economic Forum, the proportion of mobile workers who could work from any location, is expected to rise beyond 70%. While this has benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries with it a significant risk of erosion of boundaries between professional and personal life.”The bill emphasises “the need to respect personal space of employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employers’ calls, emails, etc, during out-of-work hours”. It seeks to impose sanctions at the rate of 1% of total employees’ remuneration on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the bill’s provisions.The bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use. To free employees from digital distractions and enable them to truly connect with people around then, it provides for digital detox centres.The bill also takes into consideration the competitive needs of companies and their diverse work cultures. Calling for flexibility in the right to disconnect rules, it leaves it to the companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees for working out-of-work hours.“The bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect,” it stated.","Ncp’s supriya sule has introduced a bill in lok sabha to confer the right on employees to disconnect from work-related phone calls & e-mails beyond work hours and on holidays.

An Indian-origin businessman who owns a long-established medical manufacturer in Kanata (High-tech suburb of Ottawa) says he is being forced to relocate operations to India and US as the company gives up its nuclear licence. This is a move he says will cost hundreds of high-tech jobs.Krishnan Suthanthiran, owner of Best Theratronics, said surrendering the licence would lead to “the loss of 200 high-tech jobs” after Canada’s nuclear regulator took action over the company’s failure to meet licence conditions.On Friday, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) confirmed that Best Theratronics is in the process of removing the nuclear materials it used to manufacture cancer treatment devices. The company has secured export licences to ship its Cobalt 60 and Cesium 137 sealed sources out of Canada, officials said during a public meeting.Best Theratronics was once a Crown agency and helped develop the world’s first cancer treatment machine, reports CBC News. However, the company has struggled in recent years under private ownership. Suthanthiran said he has lost millions of dollars since buying the business from MDS Nordion in 2007.The firm also faced a long labour dispute, with workers striking for nearly 10 months over pay.In November last year, the CNSC issued formal orders after discovering the company’s financial guarantee had expired. The regulator required Best Theratronics to set aside $1.8 million to cover potential cleanup costs if the site were to be decommissioned.Suthanthiran did not comply. He told CBC in October that the regulator was wrong and that he did not have the funds to restore the guarantee. Instead, he said he would abandon the nuclear licence and shift the company towards non-nuclear activities.In an email to CBC, Suthanthiran said the decision was forcing him “to relocate to the USA and India”, and that the cost of maintaining the nuclear licence was too high.The regulator has ordered the company to submit monthly updates on its progress. However, it missed a December reporting deadline. Company representative Manny Subramanian told the commission the delay was due to Suthanthiran being out of the country.“We ended up sending about a day late or two days late because Krish, the president of the company, was travelling. We couldn’t get ahold of him,” Subramanian said.The next deadline comes on Tuesday, when Best Theratronics must submit an initial plan to decommission its Kanata plant.","Krishnan suthanthiran, owner of best theratronics, said surrendering the licence would lead to ‘the loss of 200 high-tech jobs’ the company has secured export licences to ship its cobalt 60 and cesium 137 sealed sources out of canada.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125963897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1277402,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects. “Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.","Cuban advice young engineers to not go behind big companies for ai opportunities.

Amazon Announces Landmark $35B Investment In India To Drive Digital Transformation

Not a bartender material, says Jeff Bezos





Amazon and how it changed shopping industry









Jeff Bezos has been credited to change the way people shop, however, the Amazon.com founder once revealed that his dream job was not running a trillion-dollar tech empire. In fact, his dream job was nothing related to technology but crafting high-end cocktails behind a bar. He was replying to a question from his brother Mark who asked about his dream job if money wasn't a factor.“I pride myself on my craft cocktails. I do have this fantasy that I want to be a bartender,” he said. The conversation in question is a 2017 discussion. While opening up more on his “fantasy” job, Bezos said that he has “glamorised the job” in his mind, but he loves talking about a well-made drink.Bezos, however, said that he is not a ‘bartender material’ because he is slow and takes his time when crafting cocktails. “I'm super slow,” he said, joking that his bar would charge premium prices to make drinks slow. Bezos also said he would have a sign behind him, “You can have it good or you can have it fast.”While Bezos may not have got his dream job, he made billions from heading Amazon. He has a net worth of $238.4 billion, according to Forbes Billionaire List, making him the fourth richest person on Earth. He founded the e-commerce giant in 1994, which is now worth nearly $2.5 trillion.In 2021, he stepped down as Amazon's chief executive officer. Bezos also founded Blue Origin, a space company focused on making space travel safer and more affordable, and competes with Elon Musk.Recently, Bezos again took a job where he will serve as co-CEO of a new AI startup that focuses on engineering and manufacturing of computers, automobiles and spacecraft. The company is called Project Prometheus and it garnered $6.2 billion in funding, partly from his own company Amazon, making it one of the most well-financed early-stage startups in the world.","Jeff bezos once revealed that his dream job was not running a trillion-dollar tech empire but crafting high-end cocktails behind a bar.

Washington: Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called “slop”. The word’s proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster’s 2025 word of the year. “It’s such an illustrative word,” said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster’s president ahead of Monday’s announcement. “It’s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it’s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.”“Slop” was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean “digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence”. In other words, “you know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,” Barlow said.AI video generators have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now — and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, defence secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend US military actions in Venezuela.The Canadian animated show “Franklin” teaches about kindness, empathy and inclusivity — but in Hegseth’s hands, its main character became a tool to promote violence. The word “slop” evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew.To select the word of the year, the dictionary’s editors review data about which words have risen in searches and usage.

LONDON:





Sophie Kinsella, the author of “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and a series of millions-selling rom-com sequels, died Monday, her family said. She was 55 and had been diagnosed with brain cancer. The family posted on Kinsella’s Instagram account: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy. “We can’t imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.”Kinsella, who also published under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, announced in April 2024 that she had been diagnosed in late 2022 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. “I did not share this before because I wanted to make sure that my children were able to hear and process the news in privacy and adapt to our ’new normal,’” she said at the time.Starting in 2000 with “The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic”, titled “Confessions of a Shopaholic” in the US, Kinsella published 10 “Shopaholic” novels, along with other fiction. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.The first two “Shopaholic” books were adapted into the 2009 film “Confessions of a Shopaholic”, starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy. Kinsella did not grow up intending to be a writer. One of three girls born to teachers in London, she played piano and violin as a child and also composed music. She told authorpublisher Zibby Owens on her podcastthat the idea of writing never crossed her mind.Kinsella enrolled at Oxford University to study music but switched to the politics, philosophy and economics program after one year. While at college, she fell in love with musician Henry Wickham. The couple had four sons and a daughter.After graduating, Kinsella began working as a financial journalist and spent her commute reading. The idea to write fiction herself began to take shape on the train. She published her debut novel, “The Tennis Party”, in 1995 when she was 24, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including “The Gatecrasher” and “Sleeping Arrangements”, followed.An otherwise normal shopping excursion sparked the idea for writing her first “Shopaholic” novel. “I remember looking around me and thinking... “We all shop... We talk about it. We do it. We rejoice in it. We make bad decisions. Why hasn’t anybody written about this?” Kinsella said in 2019.Kinsella also wrote “The Undomestic Goddess”, “Remember Me?” and “Twenties Girl”. A young adult novel, “Finding Audrey”, was released in 2015, followed by the children’s book series “My Mummy Fairy and Me.”Her novel “Can You Keep a Secret?” was adapted into a film starring Alexandra Daddario and Tyler Hoechlin in 2019. Her last novel was “The Burnout,” released in 2023.After her diagnosis, she wrote a novella, “What Does It Feel Like”, about a woman with five children who has brain cancer. “I thought people might be curious to know what it’s like to go through this,” Kinsella said in an interview with TV personality Robin Roberts . “I hope it’s full of optimism and love most of all.”","Sophie kinsella, author of ""confessions of a shopaholic,"" dies at 55.

"Watch: Black bear attacks keeper during stage show at Hangzhou Safari Park, viral video triggers safety debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-black-bear-attacks-keeper-during-stage-show-at-hangzhou-safari-park-viral-video-triggers-safety-debate/articleshow/125827140.cms,"



A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at hangzhou safari park in china.

How Dubai Courts are recognising Crypto as legal Property under UAE Digital Asset rules?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-dubai-courts-are-recognising-crypto-as-legal-property-under-uae-digital-asset-rules/articleshow/125976595.cms,"Dubai's Courts are giving your digital money real-world protection / Image: File

UAE’s new Digital Asset rules explained

Crypto is Intangible Personal Property: A key ruling in the Huobi v Tabarak case, following the enactment of the DIFC Digital Assets Law (No. 2 of 2024), formally classified cryptocurrencies and digital tokens as intangible personal property. This means your Bitcoin is now treated with the same legal respect as a stock certificate, a car title, or a traditional bank account balance.

The Power of the Freeze: Once classified as property, the courts gained the authority to use their most powerful legal defense tools. Most notably, they can issue Worldwide Freezing Orders (WFOs). If a judge suspects a fraudster is trying to move or liquidate stolen crypto, the WFO can effectively pause the assets globally. This is the single most important step in protecting investor capital during a dispute.

New tools for Crypto and Digital Asset

Secure Custody Services: The courts now have the ability to work with secure third-party custodians who can hold digital assets during legal proceedings. This ensures that crypto under dispute remains protected and traceable throughout the court process.

Blockchain Intelligence Tools: Judges and legal teams can use blockchain forensic tools to trace transactions on distributed ledgers. This is crucial in disputes involving stolen, lost or contested digital assets, where traditional financial tracking methods don’t apply.

Intelligence Tools: Judges and legal teams can use blockchain forensic tools to trace transactions on distributed ledgers. This is crucial in disputes involving stolen, lost or contested digital assets, where traditional financial tracking methods don’t apply. Training and Judicial Expertise: Court staff and judges are receiving technical training so they better understand blockchain, wallets, smart contracts and digital asset custody, bridging the gap between technology and the law.

Other regulatory framework in the UAE

In 2022, the UAE issued Cabinet Decision No. 111 of 2022 on the Regulation of Virtual Assets and their Service, requiring digital asset operations to be licensed and regulated, a foundational step in establishing legal clarity.

Dubai passed Law No. 4 of 2022 on the Regulation of Virtual Assets and its subsidiary regulations, empowering the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to oversee onshore digital asset activities, including custody, issuance, and enforcement.

Separately, the DIFC enacted Digital Assets Law No. 2 of 2024, defining digital assets as intangible property, clarifying how ownership and control are legally understood, which is key for disputes, transfers and enforcement actions.





For years, the multi-billion dollar question for global investors was simple: is the code in your digital wallet legally considered ""property""? If the law doesn't recognize it as such, then courts couldn't properly protect it. Well, Dubai has delivered a definitive answer, fundamentally changing the risk profile for anyone dealing in digital assets within the Emirate.The critical change came from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Courts, the specialized commercial judiciary that operates under Common Law principles. This legal body took decisive steps to establish a solid foundation for digital asset protection:To support this legal evolution, the DIFC Courts have rolled out specialised services and technologies tailored to digital asset disputes, making them crypto-ready:These innovations mean the Dubai judiciary can handle crypto disputes with the same confidence as traditional asset disputes, reducing ambiguity and strengthening enforcement.Dubai courts’ efforts fit into a broader UAE strategy to regulate and secure digital assets:Together these rules form a legal infrastructure where digital assets are no longer grey-area technology, but recognised property with rights, protections, and legal remedies.Dubai is not just accepting digital assets, it is integrating them into its legal system with real protections and enforceable rights. From specialised court tools to updated regulations recognising crypto as property, the UAE is shaping a judicial environment ready for the digital economy’s future. This strategic evolution promises greater legal certainty, stronger investor trust, and a leading role for Dubai in global digital asset law.","Dubai's courts are giving your digital money real-world protection.

Supplier licences like the one obtained by Sportradar, a major sports data and betting services provider, further strengthening the ecosystem for regulated online sports wagering and gaming.

How to download Play971?





The United Arab Emirates has taken a major step into the world of regulated online gaming and sports betting with the launch of its first licensed internet gaming and sports wagering website. The platform, called Play971, is officially authorised and regulated by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), the federal body responsible for supervising all commercial gaming activity in the country.Play971 is operated by Coin Technology Projects LLC, a firm incorporated in Abu Dhabi with its main base at Twofour54 Yas Creative Hub, and claims to be fully “located, licensed and regulated in the UAE.” This launch marks a significant milestone for a country that has long been known for strict anti-gambling laws rooted in cultural and religious norms.Play971’s debut represents more than just a new website. It introduces a regulated environment for real-money online games and sports wagering that did not exist before under UAE law. The platform includes a range of casino-style games and sports betting markets, including popular events like football and tennis.Under the supervision of the GCGRA, players and operators must follow strict responsible gaming standards, including systems to verify user identity and ensure that only eligible participants within the UAE can access the service. This controlled launch currently applies in certain emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah, with broader availability expected in early 2026 as the regulatory framework and licensing system evolves.This early rollout serves as a test case for future operators, and regulators continue to refine licensing categories, supplier approvals and compliance rules so that the market expands safely and transparently.The UAE’s move toward regulated online gaming builds on multiple earlier steps. In 2024, the first official lottery licence was awarded to The Game LLC, beginning regulated draw operations with major prizes.According to the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), internet gaming is considered a form of “commercial gaming conducted via the internet, using computers, mobile phones, or other digital devices with access to websites or apps that offer games and bets involving chance, skill, or a combination of both.” The regulator notes that these games include bingo, casino games such as slots and poker, eSports, fantasy games, peer-to-peer games, skill-based games, sports betting, and more.On sports wagering specifically, the GCGRA explains that it “involves betting on the outcome of sports events or the performance of athletes or teams,” and that wagers can only be placed legally through licensed operators and sportsbooks.Separately, the GCGRA has also issued:Together, these moves show the UAE modernising its commercial gaming landscape with a regulated, consumer-safe framework rather than a permissive or unregulated market.At launch, Play971 is accessible primarily through its official website, rather than via public app stores. Users can register and play directly online, following identity verification and eligibility checks required by the UAE’s gaming regulator.As of now, no standalone mobile app has been publicly listed on major platforms such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This cautious approach aligns with the UAE’s tightly controlled regulatory rollout, ensuring compliance with responsible gaming and digital licensing standards before wider distribution.According to industry observers and regulatory context shared in official announcements, any future mobile app rollout, whether on iOS or Android, would require separate approvals from the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA), as well as compliance with platform-specific policies.The availability of Play971 is also being introduced in phases, with access currently aligned to emirates and jurisdictions where regulatory readiness has been confirmed, including Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. Wider nationwide access is expected to follow only after regulators complete further reviews of system performance, consumer safeguards, and operational compliance.Officials have stressed that users should avoid unlicensed apps or websites claiming to offer UAE-approved betting services, as Play971 remains the only legally licensed online sports wagering and iGaming platform in the country at this stage.With the national lottery, casino-resort projects, vendor license and now Play971, the UAE is slowly but deliberately building a regulated commercial gaming ecosystem that is secure and transparent for consumers and operators alike.",Uae enters regulated online sports betting market officially.
