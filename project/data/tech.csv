ALMHULT: After putting in over Rs 10,500 crore since 2018 in India, Swedish furniture retailer IKEA is planning a ""second wave"" of growth in India, focused on accelerated expansion backed by stronger local sourcing and logistics and a deeper omni-channel strategy, said Patrik Antoni, CEO, IKEA India.Discussing the challenges due to the US's tariff moves, Jesper Brodin, CEO of INGKA Group, the biggest franchisee of Inter IKEA, said the company will adapt to the new scenario. ""There's still significant uncertainty, and while IKEA has limited ability to influence outcomes, the focus is on preparing to adapt, given that its supply chain is far more regional and local than many assume,"" he said.Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in India every year, a significant step-up from its current pace of rolling out one store every year or two.The upcoming formats will be a mix of large-format flagship stores, such as those in Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai, and Bengaluru; new outlets in Noida and Gurugram; and smaller city-centre stores, planning studios, and online platforms.""The IKEA experience is no longer limited to a single visit to a large store - it's a combination of many touchpoints, more convenient and more accessible,"" Antoni added. Localisation will be central to IKEA's India strategy.The company plans to increase local sourcing from 30% today to 50% by 2030. With partnerships already in place with 45 suppliers, many of whom export globally, IKEA is also investing in a design centre to create products tailored for Indian homes, with an emphasis on sustainable and recycled materials, including Indian wood varieties.Antoni said India's growing role as a sourcing hub strengthens IKEA's ability to balance supply chain risks. ""Localisation and diversification are important for us. As global trade dynamics evolve, India's position becomes even more critical in ensuring affordability and resilience in our offering,"" he noted.Beyond retail, IKEA's India presence spans sourcing, a global capability centre, a digital hub supporting global teams, and Ingka Centres' two large shopping centres under construction in Noida and Gurugram.(The writer is in Almhult, Sweden, at the invitation of IKEA Group)",Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in india every year.

Noel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noel-tatas-mother-and-former-tata-group-director-simone-tata-in-critical-condition/articleshow/123375513.cms,"Simone Tata made a rare public appearance at the launch of the revamped flagship Westside store in South Mumbai in October 2019.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone tata, the mother of tata trusts chairman noel tata, is in critical condition.

project

KOCHI: The year M A Abdullah Maulavi was born marked the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of rapid tech transformation. Little did the now 105-year-old Kerala native know that it would take him another century and more to find his tech mojo as a ""fully digi-literate"" person able to use a smartphone.""I used to have keypad phones. With training from the panchayat, I can now access internet on a smartphone, keep myself abreast of news,"" Abdullah told TOI.The centenarian is among 22 lakh Keralites to have undergone training under state's Digi Keralam project, meant to achieve 100% digital literacy - the second such landmark since communist-governed Kerala became India's first fully literate state in 1991.For Abdullah, a resident of Odakkali in Ernakulam district's Perumbavoor, the pandemic was the catalyst for change. His son Faisal Ali recalls seeing his father get increasingly restless during the lockdown as the newspapers stopped coming. ""He would watch news channels on our phones, but didn't relish having to depend on others,"" Faisal said. ""Last year, when Digi Keralam volunteers asked if he was interested in becoming digitally literate, my father grabbed the opportunity. He didn't want to be left behind.""It helped that Abdullah, a religious scholar, has been a learner all his life. He is fluent in Arabic, Urdu, English and Hindi, besides Malayalam. But Jaya CR, the area's saksharatha pracharak and Digi Kerala panchayat coordinator, said teaching Abdullah wasn't easy. ""He had a disciplined routine for decades, leaving little room for new things. Our volunteers had to adapt to his schedule and learning methods."" The training lasted two months, during which Abdullah and the other learners were taught the basics of operating a smartphone. They also learnt how to pay bills and access govt e-services. With over two million citizens benefiting from the initiative, CM Pinarayi Vijayan is ready to declare Kerala a fully digi-literate state on Aug 21.","Centenarian trained under state's digi keralam project, meant to achieve 100% digital literacy. 22 lakh keralites have undergone training under the initiative.

Cabinet okays bill that seeks to ban ‘online money game',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-okays-bill-that-seeks-to-ban-online-money-game/articleshow/123396077.cms,"2 years' jail, ₹50L fine likely for those advertising online games

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that seeks to ban ""online money game"", where users pay a fee or deposit money, proposing a maximum three years in jail or fine of up to Rs 1 crore for those involved in offering, encouraging or inducing players to participate, which also extends to banks facilitating these transactions.At the same time, Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, which will be introduced in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, seeks to promote e-sports and online social games where no money is involved.A regulator body is planned to oversee the functioning of the sector, sources told TOI. The proposed legislation defines ""online money game"" as an online game played by a user by paying fees, depositing money or other stakes in expectation of winning.Online social games have been defined as those that don't involve exchange of money, although users may be allowed to pay a subscription or one-time access fee.Govt has proposed the new law considering unregulated online money gaming platforms pose threats to national and economic security as they use digital wallets and cryptocurrencies for money laundering and illicit money transfer, cross-border data flows without compliance of data protection law, sources said.Moreover, offshore entities are seen to be circumventing tax and legal obligations.The proposed legislation also assumes significance as online money gaming poses serious concerns, including addiction among children and youth, mental health issues, financial losses leading to suicides and lack of uniform regulation across states. Law enforcing agencies face problems in tracking and regulating these platforms, particularly those hosted or operated from outside India.Sources said the govt proposes penalties of up to two years in jail or with a maximum fine of Rs 50 lakh or both for any entity advertising such games in media. For those offering online money games and banks engaged in transactions face violations of the proposed law will be ""cognisable and non-bailable"" offences. Every subsequent violation after conviction would attract penalties of at least three years' jail and fine of Rs 10-20 lakh. In the case of advertisers, such penalties would be 2-3 years in jail and fine of Rs 5-10 lakh.The bill proposes to hold senior executives of the companies liable, if it's established that the offences have been committed with the consent or connivance or due to their neglect.It also proposes blocking of platforms and money gaming services, if the entities or individuals fail to comply with the law.According to the proposal, the bill seeks to encourage Indian startups to build culturally relevant content, reduce dependence on foreign platforms and promote self-reliance in the digital gaming ecosystem.","2 years' jail, ₹50l fine likely for those advertising online games.

This free-to-play first-person shooter instantly hit the charts as fans really liked its wide range of gamemodes.Delta Force even later went on to release for mobiles as well but console fans were still wondering when they would get this game on their platform. Now, it’s pretty good to see the game is here on consoles as well, that is why let’s learn about the cross-platform feature in the game.As Delta Force is now available on multiple platforms, crossplay is an important factor.

If anyone wants to play Delta Force on their PCs and with their friends on consoles, they can, and vice-versa is supported as well.The crossplay option is already kept active in PCs. They will be placed both with the PC users and console users in matchmaking queues. But in the case of consoles, the crossplay option is toggled off by default.However, toggling it on is pretty easy because all you have to do is to visit the Game tab in the Settings menu. There you will find a Crossplay toggle button.The unavailability of crossplay options for mobile devices is quite understandable. Both mobile and PC+console have separate matchmaking pools to maintain balance given hardware differences.Unlike crossplay, cross-progression is supported on any platform you play Delta Force on.

It’s pretty interesting to see mobile players doesn’t get to be matched with other platforms but yet supports cross-progression through different platforms.In order to sync all your progress, first you need to create a Level Infinite Pass (LIPAS) account, which you might have already created before logging into the game. Now, if you want to sync your account progression in different devices, then log in with the same LIPAS account in your desired platform or connect your LIPAS account to third party accounts like Discord, Gmail, and Facebook.","After over eight months being released on pc, delta force is finally here for the consoles.

Fortnite Levels Up: Coming Soon to Discord via NVIDIA Partnership



Free Trial and What’s Next



Fortnite is no stranger to breaking boundaries and now it seems that the next major move is gearing up there. Discord has revealed a partnership with NVIDIA's cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, originally catching gamers by surprise. This way, Fortnite will be playable inside the Discord app, no downloads, no launchers, instant play.For years, Discord was where gamers came to hang, chat, organize streams, or get community support. NVIDIA is entering the universe and adding a layer at the social platform pertaining to actual games. The integration will allow users to play Fortnite and other popular titles directly on Discord, with cloud power provided by GeForce NOW.The never ending journey to months of installation time and update downloads is now over. Now, players can enter right into the game within seconds. According to Discord, the aim isn't for it to become a gaming platform but to fast-track and simplify the gaming world.Once the global launch happens, players will enjoy a short-term free trial of the GeForce NOW Performance tier, which usually costs $10. In this tier, gaming is rendered at 1440p with 60 frames per second and thus provides a smooth gaming experience.After the free trial, gamers can either pay and be on the paid plan to continue playing or opt for the ad supported option instead.The first instance of this feature’s public presentation will be behind closed doors at Gamescom 2025, with Fortnite headlining the presentation. If the early tests go well, this could change forever the way players get into games on Discord servers.For many, Discord is already dubbed the ""community favorite platform,"" with 72% of its users playing games while chatting on the app. Instant gaming through GeForce NOW will just make that experience more smooth , no installs, no patches, no waiting.The scenario truly mirrors the past attempts of Google Stadia and Gaikai, who once sold the fantasy of ""click and play"" video games. While those platforms essentially stopped existing, Discord's strong community standing alongside NVIDIA's proven cloud service could see this dream getting a new lease on life.Be it well, Fortnite fans would soon be diving into matches from the Discord server of their choice. And there could be so much bigger going on amidst this social hub for gaming.","Fortnite will be playable inside the discord app, no downloads, no launchers, instant play.

Charlotte Jones makes the Cowboys’ stance crystal clear

Micah Parsons’ future could reshape the Cowboys’ identity



The Dallas Cowboys’ preseason is already carrying more drama off the field than on it, and Micah Parsons is at the center of it all. With contract negotiations stalled, frustration mounting, and trade chatter intensifying, Charlotte Jones’ latest comments have only poured fuel on speculation that the Cowboys could lose their most dynamic defensive star.Speaking this week, Charlotte Jones admitted that talks with Parsons remain frozen. Despite Dallas holding over $32 million in salary cap space, there has been no move to improve the offer initially discussed back in March. Her father, Jerry Jones, echoed the firm approach, saying: “Our future is a challenge, and he’s made for it.” The Cowboys’ position sends a message: they won’t be rushed into paying more, even for a player of Parsons’ caliber.The issue is not just about numbers. Parsons, a three-time Pro Bowler, has skipped practice citing “physical discomfort,” but his farewell-style social media message — “Thank you Dallas” — hinted at something deeper. With reports suggesting the Cowboys’ offer is around $24 million per year, well below the league’s top defensive contracts, it’s no surprise tensions are rising.Now, the defensive ace faces two choices: accept a deal he believes undervalues him or force his way out via trade.Several contenders — including the Eagles, Lions, Patriots, Bears, and Bills — are rumored to be monitoring the situation closely.Also Read: NFL insider Adam Schefter makes bold prediction on Cleveland Browns quarterback situation amid crowded roster battle If Parsons leaves, Dallas risks losing not only its best defender but also a critical piece of its identity.

Your team doesn’t care what you say

Indian parenting is full of contradictions 👇

🔹 “Express yourself!”… but not with elders

🔹 “Be confident!”… but only when convenient

🔹 “Be happy!”… but follow the path we’ve already picked

Poll Do you believe parents should lead by example when it comes to screen time? No, it's not necessary Yes, absolutely

No wonder a Harvard study found only 22% of kids said they’d turn to parents when something felt wrong.

I’m guilty too. I kept nagging my daughter > read more, eat better, spend less time on screens.

Until one day she shot back: “But you’re always on your phone.” 👀

That one line hit harder than any parenting book.

Because kids don’t listen to what you say. They copy what you do.

Same with teams!

👉 Want empathy? Talk to customers every week.

👉 Want focus? Put your own phone face down first.

"Soon, 1L postmen set to be MF distributors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/soon-1l-postmen-set-to-be-mf-distributors/articleshow/123398297.cms,"New Delhi: As part of its efforts to double the investor base, the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi) is working with India Post to train nearly one lakh postmen as distributors, in addition to focusing on four states to ensure that every district has at least 10 distributors by end of the year.Amfi chief executive Venkat Nageswar Chalasani said the industry body has adopted four states, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Meghalaya, where it is trying to train college students and is targeting 20,000 new distributors in these states in the first year. ""By end of the year, we expect at least 10 distributors in each district of these states and at least 20 by next year,"" said Chalasani. Besides, tie-ups with leading academic institutions are in the offing to ""train the trainers"".AMFI has already partnered the department of posts to address legacy issues related to KYC of individuals, who did not have Aadhaar numbers seeded. The plan is now to extend it to training postmen as India Post revamps its operations, focusing on turning each of its verticals into a profit centre. If the move goes through, postmen will be like relationship managers in banks, who hawk savings products.For mutual funds nearly 45% of the investments are now coming from the bottom 30 towns, although overall 65% of the share is from the top 30 cities.Annually around 30,000 new distributors join the mutual fund industry but net additions hover around the 10,000-mark. While changing savings habits and online platforms have seen a surge in new investors into mutual funds, especially through systematic investor plans (SIPs), new distributors are seen to be critical in expanding the footprint to smaller towns and rural areas.There is a boom in mutual fund investments in the last few years resulting in the number of folios jumping from 2.1 crore in 2019 to 5.6 crore now. Chalasani said the target is to double it in the next few years.""Our campaign has created tremendous awareness and we will see a massive growth as there is a huge potential,"" he said, pointing to 80 crore bank accounts in the country.Currently, the assets under management in India are to the tune of 21% of GDP, compared to more than 100% in developed countries and 65% being the global average.",The association of mutual funds of india (amfi) is working with india post to train nearly one lakh postmen as distributors.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain drops mandate for apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of american citizens.
