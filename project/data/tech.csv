SC seeks government’s response on social media blocking rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-seeks-governments-response-on-social-media-blocking-rules/articleshow/118692085.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a PIL that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ Blocking Rules, 2009 ’ on the ground that it violated the right of content creators to be heard by authorities, who preferred to direct social media platforms to block content.Appearing for PIL petitioner organisation ‘Software Freedom Law Centre’, senior advocate Indira Jaising told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K Vinod Chandran that under Rule 9 of Blocking Rules, authorities had the freedom to issue notice either to the content creator or the social media platform which hosted the content. Be it Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or other social media platforms, authorities give blocking notices only to them to avoid giving reasons to the content creator for deciding to block certain posts, Jaising said.“The arbitrary use of Rule 9 as an emergency provision to block user content without any prior notification leaves the originator of the content no mechanism of relief due to the lack of a notice, a reasoned order, and an opportunity to be heard. These rights are intrinsic to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to receive information, which can be granted to the originator even as the blocking order is in effect,” she said. Though the bench said it would have been appropriate for any content creator who was aggrieved by non-issuance of notice to him/her prior to blocking of content to move court, it decided to issue notice to Centre and sought its response in six weeks.Jaising said the intermediary, which hosts the content, was under no obligation to seek aresponse or clarification from the content creator when authorities gave it notice for blocking certain content, thus leaving the content creator with no remedy to retrieve the content and repost it. “An intermediary is merely providing a platform for hosting information and has no means to understand or justify the originator’s defence against the blocking order, nor does the intermediary have a vested interest in defending the originator’s content. Such a process thus renders the blocking process inherently unfair and violative of the fundamental rights of the originator,” the petitioner said.","Supreme court sought the centre’s response to a pil that challenged the constitutional validity of a provision of ‘ blocking rules, 2009 ’ the pil claimed that it violated the right of content creators to be heard by authorities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692086,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303064,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'False' toll fee deduction? NHAI cracks the whip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/false-toll-fee-deduction-nhai-cracks-the-whip/articleshow/118668029.cms,"NEW DELHI: Have you ever received a toll deduction message from your FASTag wallet even though your car was parked or you hadn't passed through a toll plaza? Officials explain that this can occur when toll operators mistakenly enter the vehicle number, often due to issues with the FASTag being unreadable for various reasons, or when people carry tags in their wallets.Cracking down on such instances of ""false"" deductions from FASTag wallet, the NHAI has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases. For each violation, the highways authority's toll management entity, IHMCL, has started imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh.Due to this high penalty, the number of such cases has reduced by almost 70% and now 50 such genuine complaints reach IHMCL in a month while nearly 30 crore FASTag transactions happen at all plazas on the national highway network.Many users have taken to social media to highlight instances of false toll deductions from their FASTag wallets, in addition to lodging complaints with IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.He said, the main reason for such false deductions is entry of incorrect vehicle numbers by toll operators while processing electronic transactions manually.","Nhai has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases of ""false"" deductions.

Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen

Tom Brady is making a big transition in his life as he gets set to sell his $150 million Miami estate, a home where he previously lived with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. Sources indicate that the sale comes from the emotional pain of watching Bündchen progress with her new life and her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn baby. While Brady has kept his eye on his post-NFL business, the fact that his ex-wife is moving on to a new chapter has reportedly not been easy for him.Sources indicate that 47-year-old ex-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance between himself and the lingering reminders of his past. While he continues with his work and self-development, the harsh fact of remaining unmarried for close to three years with his former spouse, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, having reestablished life with her lover, Joaquim Valente, has purportedly been challenging. Unloading his $150 million Miami villa seems a part of wrapping that chapter up and opening doors to a new life.Brady and Bündchen, who share their two children, divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2022. Although they remain on good terms for the benefit of their family, the fact that their homes are in close proximity has not allowed Brady to completely move on.The supermodel and her new beau, a jiu-jitsu instructor, now share a lavish waterfront home just across from Brady's compound—a home that was originally part of the ex-couple's future together. Far from representing their aspirations, however, it now serves as a bitter reminder of what he stands to lose.For Brady, the sale of the mansion can be more than a money matter, but a heart matter as well. Leaving a city full of reminders of his own marriage may grant him the time he requires to work on being happy himself and potentially even opening himself to finding another relationship.Though he still hasn't commented publicly on his motivation for selling, those in his inner circle say the switch is about something greater than a piece of property—it's about reclaiming his sense of mind and looking to the future stage of his life.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told radaronline.com. ""He sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down. He can't take it anymore. He wants to sell the house. It reminds him of Gisele. She was the one who dominated the remodeling, and it's her style, her personal touches. He still feels her nuance everywhere.”Also Read: “I’m pretty disappointed”: Rob Gronkowski feels overlooked as Tom Brady makes Raiders moves without considering him Tom Brady has no plans to leave Miami, the city he moved to in 2019 when he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he is looking to downsize and find a more private residence that allows him to step away from the memories tied to his current home.Despite wanting a fresh start, Tom Brady remains dedicated to co-parenting his two children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. His goal is to create a peaceful and comfortable environment where he can focus on his personal well-being while staying actively involved in his children's lives.","Tom brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from gisele bündchen.

Building a brand, one store at a time

Surviving the gymwear wars

From a grandmother’s sewing machine to a billion-dollar empire

At just 28, Ben Francis became Britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, Gymshark , skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation. Now, at 32, he’s setting his sights on an even bigger conquest—New York City.Later this year, Francis will open a sprawling 13,000-square-foot Gymshark store on Bond Street, a move he sees as crucial to the brand’s global success, reported the New York Post.“I love New York … It’s the perfect place for Gymshark, and I’m honored to call it our North American home,” he told me. “We have to be successful in the US in order for us to be successful around the world.”Francis built Gymshark online in 2012, capitalizing on the rise of fitness influencers and the e-commerce boom. But now, he believes physical stores are just as important as a brand’s digital presence.His first retail venture came in 2022 with a flagship store on London’s Regent Street. Dubai followed, and in late 2024, a Gymshark pop-up landed on Wooster Street in SoHo. That temporary store’s success gave Francis the confidence to commit to a permanent NYC presence.“The city has been so supportive of our brand vision,” he said. “People can finally see and feel the product we’re so proud of … I think physical brick-and-mortar stores are actually sort of a new and different way for us to reach people.”Unlike traditional athletic apparel stores, Gymshark’s locations are designed as community hubs , featuring workout spaces, personal training sessions, and room for fitness events.The $25 billion gymwear market is fiercely competitive. While brands like Outdoor Voices and Olympia Sports have folded, giants like Nike and Lululemon battle newer players like Alo Yoga and Vuori for dominance. Gymshark, however, has carved out a loyal following with its sleek, performance-driven designs and strong influencer network.Francis credits Gymshark’s staying power to its community—one he built from scratch by sending free products to fitness YouTubers long before influencer marketing was mainstream.“When I was getting into the gym, all the people I learned the most from were online on YouTube,” he said. “When Gymshark started, we ended up sending product to a few of my heroes at the time.”Some of those influencers even received equity in the company, aligning their success with Gymshark’s meteoric rise.Francis, who grew up in England’s West Midlands, wasn’t an overnight success. He dabbled in multiple business ventures as a teen, many of which flopped. But when he started Gymshark, he had a clear vision: create gym clothes that were breathable, sweat-wicking, and odor-resistant.He learned to sew from his grandmother and stitched early orders himself. The brand’s rapid success was fueled by both its quality and Francis’ transparency—he let customers see behind the scenes of the business, building trust and loyalty.“People nowadays are interested in the story behind a brand,” he said. “They want to know who’s behind the scenes, who’s running it, and what the story is.”Now, as he brings Gymshark to the heart of New York, Francis is betting big on a future where fitness isn’t just about working out—it’s about belonging.","At just 28, ben francis became britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, gymshark, skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation.

‘False FASTag toll deduction ’: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately.

The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles.

Stock market crash : Smallcap and midcap stocks have experienced their most severe decline since the March 2020 Covid market downturn, causing significant losses for retail investors. In February, widespread selling affected the broader market severely, with the BSE Smallcap index declining 14%—marking its first double-digit monthly reduction since the pandemic—whilst the Nifty Midcap 100 fell 10.8%.According to an ET analysis, within the BSE Smallcap index comprising 938 stocks, 321 companies saw declines exceeding 20% in a single month. Notable casualties included Vakrangee, Zen Technologies, Oriental Rail Infra, and Suratwwala Business Group, which fell between 40% and 66%. The situation appears particularly severe, with 243 smallcap companies now trading at less than half their 52-week peak values.The Nifty Midcap 100 descended to its lowest point since March 27, 2024, whilst the Nifty Smallcap 100 dropped 3% to reach its lowest close since March 19, 2024, the ET report said. Investors' confidence continues to deteriorate amidst persistent selling, unfavourable global indicators, political uncertainty, and concerns about liquidity in smaller capitalisation stocks.Pratik Gupta of Kotak Institutional Equities maintains a cautious stance regarding small and midcap valuations. ""We remain cautious on the outlook for small/mid-caps in general due to expensive valuations in many cases. We have been negative for a while, and despite the correction, we do not believe the valuations have come down enough.""Also Read | Stock market crash: Sensex, Nifty are bleeding! Why it may be time to put your money in gold, silver, FDs, bonds & other investment avenues Gupta identified several key concerns, including potential severe global economic deceleration, reduced agricultural income due to poor monsoons affecting construction, and decreased domestic retail investment in equities. ""Most local MF, insurance, and PMS funds are seeing a slowdown in their equity inflows, but overall net inflows continue. The nature of flows has, however, shifted from small/midcaps or thematic/sectoral funds to large-cap or balanced debt-equity funds,"" he observed.Sudeep Shah, Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical & Derivatives Research at SBI Securities, noted significant technical deterioration in both indices. ""The Nifty Midcap 100 has slipped below its 100-week EMA for the first time since August 2020, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 has been trading below its 100-week EMA for the last three weeks. The 14-week RSI is in bearish territory and falling, which is a negative sign.""He outlined important price points for observation. ""For the Nifty Midcap 100, the 47,200-47,000 zone will act as immediate support, while a further slide below 47,000 could open doors to 46,400. On the upside, 48,800-48,900 will be a key hurdle. Meanwhile, for the Nifty Smallcap 100, support is placed at 14,200-14,100, which aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its prior rally from 8,682 to 19,716. Resistance is at 15,100-15,200.""Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact Rajkumar Singhal, CEO of Quest Investment Advisors, observed that disappointing earnings have significantly affected small and midcap sectors. ""Smallcap valuations remain above long-term averages, and earnings downgrades have exacerbated the sell-off. With earnings likely to recover in CY25, the pain in small and midcaps may ease, but a selective, bottom-up approach is key—focus on quality businesses with strong balance sheets and sustainable growth.""Market analysts provide differing perspectives on current market conditions. Dharmesh Shah from ICICI Direct draws confidence from past market behaviour. ""Over the past two decades, midcaps and smallcaps have corrected by 25-30% during bull markets before seeing a strong rebound,"" he noted, whilst acknowledging the possibility of further decline whilst suggesting current levels may indicate approaching market bottom.According to Shah's analysis, present market valuations present opportunities in quality midcap and smallcap shares, with potential upside movement anticipated within the next quarter.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Offering an alternative perspective, market specialist Nischal Maheshwari advocates for a selective approach towards mid and smallcap investments. ""We should stick to sectors where we find comfort in valuations. If mid and smallcaps have corrected enough and you feel comfortable with the valuation, you can look at them selectively.""Given the current international uncertainties, pre-election market volatility, and deteriorating technical indicators, investors must decide between immediate market participation or maintaining a cautious stance.

MUMBAI: Boring may be better for most Dalal Street investors. While the sensex is down over 6% this year, the BSE midcap index has slid 17% and smallcap has plunged over 22%.Market players say that pain for mid and small-cap investors is not likely to ease soon - due to earnings downgrades and overvaluation concerns. At the same time, some institutional investors are beginning to see some value in large-cap stocks. However, any upside will be limited until the relentless selling by foreign funds eases.To be sure, over a five-year period, the BSE midcap index is up 172%, while the smallcap one has rallied 220%, as against the sensex's 95% gain. The sharp drawdown in small and mid-cap stocks isn't particularly surprising as these scrips are typically more volatile than blue chips. Financial advisers say that small and mid-cap stocks should only be considered by long-term investors. ""Domestic investors remain worried about the risk of further earnings downgrades given the weak commentary by many companies,"" Pratik Gupta, CEO & co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities, said.Analysts see the slowdown continuing to impact corporate earnings through the current quarter and the June quarter. Institutional investors - foreign and domestic - say there is scope for small and mid-cap stocks to fall further. ""Even after the recent correction, we do not believe mid & small-cap valuations have come down enough,"" Gupta said.While NSE data shows that foreign funds ownership in Indian stocks has dropped to a 13-year low of 17.4% as of Dec, these investors continue to hold an oversized influence on the D-Street. Analysts expect the foreign fund selling to slow in March as large-cap valuations look 'less expensive'.""Foreign funds are unlikely to sell as aggressively as in the last few months. Long-term investors can utilise the weakness in the market to slowly accumulate fairly valued quality large-caps,"" V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said in a note.","The sensex is down over 6% this year, the bse midcap index has slid 17% and smallcap has plunged over 22%.

NEW DELHI: Activity in the country's manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in 14 months as production and new orders moderated but it still remained robust, a survey showed on Monday.The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a reading of 56.3 in Feb, down from 57.7 in Jan, but still indicative of further improvement in the health of the sector. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction in the survey, which is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 400 manufacturing firms.The Feb data showed a forty-fourth consecutive rise in new business intakes , which panel members linked to strong client demand and efforts to price better than their competitors. The overall pace of growth receded to the slowest since Dec last year, but was above its long-run average.""Although output growth slowed to the weakest level since Dec 2023, overall momentum in India's manufacturing sector remained broadly positive in Feb,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. New export orders rose strongly in Feb as manufacturers continued to capitalise on robust global demand for their goods. Although softer than Jan's near 14-year high, the pace of expansion was sharp, the survey results showed.In response to the upturn in new orders, manufacturers continued to expand their workforce numbers in Feb, extending the period of employment growth to a year. The rate of job-creation was the second-best in the series history, behind only that recorded in January.","The hsbc india manufacturing purchasing managers' index (pmi) registered a reading of 56.3 in feb.

NEW DELHI: Gold will remain relevant for investors as a portfolio diversification mechanism with a likely ascending importance as an asset class in the coming years, CEA V Anantha Nageswaran said on Monday.He said that gold will remain relevant not only as a store of value, as an ornament for cultural and religious purposes, but also as an important portfolio diversification mechanism ""until such a time the world is able to arrive at an international monetary system from the current international monetary non-system"". He was speaking at the IGPC-IIMA annual gold and gold markets conference 2025.The value of gold has increased by over $200 per ounce or 8% in the last three months to $2,860 per ounce.

India is a net importer of gold.He said it is very important to remember the relevance and the importance of gold for a portfolio, a store of value, etc, more so in the backdrop of the likely ascending importance of gold in the coming years. Nageswaran also hoped that India will find ways to productively deploy the gold assets that it has without diluting its role as a symbol of store of value as well as cultural and religious significance. ""That is where the policy challenge lies,"" he said.""So given that the fear of inflation is still there and the world is witnessing the after effects and the consequences of policy discretion that commenced in 1973, gold's importance will continue to remain very salient and high,"" Nageswaran said.","The value of gold has increased by over $200 per ounce or 8% in the last three months.
