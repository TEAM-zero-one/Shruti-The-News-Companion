""There is a rough estimate that 45 crore people lose money every year. Total impact of the loss is estimated to be around Rs 20,000 crore,"" the source said, on a day when the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha.""Every parliamentarian has raised concerns about the ill effects of online gaming involving money.

Is Roblox really shutting down after backlash and ongoing scrutiny?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-roblox-really-shutting-down-after-backlash-and-ongoing-scrutiny/articleshow/123382058.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, Roblox repeatedly denied the claims of Roblox shutdown rumors, calling it a hoax and giving reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true.Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the play-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims roblox will shut down on september 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

Implications for Indian Sport

Boost for Esports

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, amid protests by the Opposition. The legislation, which seeks to promote and regulate the online gaming sector, has drawn contrasting reactions — delighting the esports industry but sparking alarm in the multi-billion-dollar real money gaming market.On Thursday, the Rajya Sabha also passed the Online Gaming Bill, amid protests and sloganeering from the Opposition. The legislation, already cleared by the Lok Sabha, was tabled for consideration and passage by Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Vaishnaw described the bill as a crucial step to regulate the rapidly growing sector, encourage innovation, and address risks associated with money-based gaming.The bill seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the online gaming industry, with the twin objectives of promoting growth and protecting youth and vulnerable groups from the social, economic, psychological, and privacy-related harms of such games.The legislation proposes the creation of a central regulatory body to oversee four key segments: esports, educational games, social gaming, and real money gaming.Among these, real money gaming platforms — such as poker and fantasy sports — face the biggest blow.The Bill’s “Prohibitions” clause states: “No person shall offer, aid, abet, induce or otherwise indulge or engage in the offering of online money game and online money gaming service.” It further bans banks and financial institutions from processing transactions for such platforms.Under the “Offences and Penalties” clause, service providers found offering real money games could face up to three years’ imprisonment or fines of up to Rs 1 crore. Advertising such platforms could also invite jail terms of up to two years or fines of Rs 50 lakh.The government defended the move, citing widespread social and financial harms: “The proliferation of online money games…offering monetary returns against user deposits has led to serious social, financial, psychological and public health harms, particularly among young individuals and economically disadvantaged groups.”Cricket, which has seen a surge in real money gaming sponsorships, stands to be most affected. Dream11, India’s team sponsor, pays approximately Rs 358 crore, while My11Circle holds IPL fantasy rights worth Rs 625 crore over five years. Several leading cricketers also hold personal endorsement deals with these companies.Sports lawyer Vidushpat Singhania noted: “Cricket is huge in India and there won’t be any dearth of sponsors for Indian cricket. However, personal sponsorship market can shrink because of this bill. Fan engagement will also be affected.” He added that fantasy apps might shift to subscription-based models, though revenues will likely fall.For the esports fraternity, however, the Bill is being hailed as a breakthrough. “The government’s intent to recognise and promote esports…is an encouraging step towards building a structured and globally competitive ecosystem,” Akshat Rathee, Co-founder and MD of NODWIN Gaming, told PTI.As esports prepares for its Olympic debut in 2027, the Bill could provide the sector with long-awaited legitimacy — marking a new era for gaming in India.","The lok sabha passed the promotion and regulation of online gaming bill, 2025, amid protests by the opposition.

Life after divorce often becomes a test of resilience, reinvention, and rediscovery. For Gisele Bündchen, the years since her 2022 split from Tom Brady have not only redefined her personal world but also sharpened her professional edge. She has managed to strike a rare balance: nurturing a blended family away from the noise of the spotlight, while simultaneously solidifying her place as a global icon whose influence reaches far beyond fashion.This summer, Gisele Bündchen shared a carousel of photos on Instagram that quietly reflected her new chapter. Among travel snaps and reflective moments, one image stood out: Joaquim Valente, her partner and jiu-jitsu instructor, playing basketball with her 15-year-old son Benjamin.For Gisele, it was more than just a picture—it symbolized trust, growth, and the delicate process of weaving past and present into a future that feels whole. Her caption, “Obrigada, verão, você foi tão bom conosco,” or “Thank you, summer, you’ve been so good to us!” underscored her sense of peace with this transition.While her family life settles into new rhythms, Gisele’s professional arc continues to soar. Just months after welcoming a baby with Valente, she graced the June/July 2025 cover of Vogue France, reminding the industry that her star power hasn’t dimmed.Financially, her story is just as compelling. With an estimated net worth of $400 million—$100 million ahead of Brady—she remains one of the most successful women in entertainment and business.

NHL Trade Rumors: Seattle Kraken linked to trade talks for Minnesota Wild’s Marco Rossi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-seattle-kraken-linked-to-trade-talks-for-minnesota-wilds-marco-rossi/articleshow/123440865.cms,"Sergei Belski-Imagn Images

Seattle Kraken’s interest in Marco Rossi could involve Jared McCann trade package

Marco Rossi’s uncertain future with Minnesota Wild also draws interest from Vancouver Canucks

The Seattle Kraken could be exploring a major roster move, as a new report suggests the team has shown interest in acquiring Minnesota Wild center Marco Rossi. The 23-year-old forward remains at odds with the Wild in contract negotiations despite coming off a breakout 24-goal, 60-point season. With Rossi’s future uncertain, both the Kraken and Vancouver Canucks have emerged as potential suitors in what could become one of the offseason’s biggest storylines.The report, from RG, links Seattle to ongoing discussions surrounding Rossi, noting that while the exact offer is unclear, Jared McCann could be involved as a potential centerpiece. McCann, the Kraken’s leading scorer and a consistent producer, is entering the fourth year of a five-year, $5 million deal. Though Seattle is not actively shopping him, his age, contract value, and scoring ability make him an attractive piece for Minnesota.Rossi, drafted ninth overall in 2020, has made it his mission this offseason to add weight and strength to counter perceptions that his 5-foot-9 frame limits his durability. His proven scoring touch and two-way instincts have already made him one of the Wild’s most promising young players, but his stalled contract talks leave open the possibility of a trade.The Vancouver Canucks are also said to be monitoring Rossi’s situation, though his price tag remains unclear. For the Kraken, a deal involving McCann would be bold but could create an exciting one-two punch down the middle with Matty Beniers and Rossi leading the offense. Seattle already boasts a pool of young centers, including Shane Wright, but Rossi offers a more proven scoring profile at his age.From the Wild’s perspective, general manager Bill Guerin could still commit to Rossi long-term, ending the speculation. However, the chance to acquire a reliable scorer like McCann, who also brings positional versatility, may hold some appeal if negotiations continue to stall.Marco Rossi’s contract impasse has quickly become one of the NHL’s most intriguing offseason storylines, drawing interest from both the Seattle Kraken and Vancouver Canucks. While the Wild could yet resolve matters and lock him up, the possibility of a blockbuster trade, potentially involving Jared McCann ensures Rossi’s name will remain central in trade rumor discussions.Also Read: Chicago Blackhawks make long-term commitment to Frank Nazar with $46.13M contract","Minnesota wild center marco rossi is at odds with the wild in contract negotiations.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Ceo judy faulkner gives away nearly all her wealth through roots & wings.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview.","Microsoft co-founder bill gates offers advice on how to answer the most common interview questions.

OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar reveals future plans: Company will build trillion-dollar data centers and sell AI infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-cfo-sarah-friar-reveals-future-plans-company-will-build-trillion-dollar-data-centers-and-sell-ai-infrastructure/articleshow/123426669.cms,"OpenAI tackles surging AI demands





Trillion-dollar data centers to power the AI future

OpenAI eyes AI infrastructure as a service

Financial growth and innovative funding

OpenAI is gearing up for a bold expansion, with Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future. According to Friar, OpenAI intends to invest heavily in trillion-dollar-scale data centers to meet the surging demand for artificial intelligence computation. Beyond supporting its own AI models like ChatGPT-5, the company is considering selling AI infrastructure services to other businesses, creating a new revenue stream. These moves reflect OpenAI’s strategy to control both the technology and physical resources driving AI innovation, while exploring financing avenues for large-scale growth.OpenAI faces unprecedented pressure to scale its computational resources. Friar highlighted that the company is “constantly under compute,” pointing to the skyrocketing demand for GPUs, AI-optimized chips, and high-performance servers. Partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave are helping to secure the required hardware, while the company’s internal Stargate initiative focuses on building massive, AI-optimized data centers both in the U.S. and internationally. These efforts aim to keep OpenAI at the forefront of AI development, supporting not only ChatGPT-5 but also enterprise applications, developer workloads, and next-generation AI experiments that require vast computational power.CEO Sam Altman has indicated that OpenAI may spend trillions of dollars on constructing and optimizing data centers in the near future. These facilities are designed to efficiently handle enormous AI workloads, increase model training speeds, and reduce latency for enterprise and consumer applications. Beyond raw computing, these data centers also represent a strategic asset, giving OpenAI control over the underlying infrastructure that powers its AI models. By owning and optimizing its own facilities rather than relying solely on third-party providers, OpenAI can maintain a competitive edge and protect proprietary innovations.Friar revealed that OpenAI is considering renting out its AI infrastructure to other businesses, inspired by Amazon Web Services’ cloud model. While the company is currently focused on securing resources for its own operations, this potential business line could create a major new revenue stream in the future. Friar emphasized the importance of retaining control over intellectual property, stating that relying too heavily on external vendors allows competitors to learn from OpenAI’s infrastructure design. By offering AI-as-a-service, OpenAI could help other companies tap into cutting-edge AI capabilities while monetizing its massive investment in data centers.OpenAI recently achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July 2025, with projections to triple revenue to $12.7 billion for the year. Paid ChatGPT subscriptions, particularly following the launch of ChatGPT-5, have driven enterprise and developer adoption. To support its infrastructure ambitions, OpenAI is exploring novel financing approaches, including debt financing with banks and private equity, as well as potential stock sales for employees and early investors. Friar also hinted at a future IPO, signaling that the company is preparing for broader access to capital to fund its ambitious plans.Friar urged companies aiming to remain competitive in AI to focus on automating real-world tasks and solving meaningful, high-impact problems. She stressed the importance of securing access to unique datasets, since more than 90% of the world’s data is locked behind universities, corporations, and other institutions. Firms that can harness exclusive information while efficiently deploying AI solutions will likely dominate the emerging market, mirroring OpenAI’s own strategy of combining technological innovation with control over infrastructure and data.","Openai is gearing up for a bold expansion, with chief financial officer sarah friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future.

OpenAI hiring for chief people officer role

OpenAI chairman warns against AI bubble

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

OpenAI’s chief people officer Julia Villagra is leaving the AI company, reports news agency Reuters. As per the report, Villagra is exiting to pursue her personal passion of using art, music and storytelling to help people understand the transition to artificial general intelligence. OpenAI has sent an internal Slack message informing the employees about her departure. It says that Julia Villagra is leaving to “pursue a passion she’s developed at OpenAI; using art, music, and storytelling to help people better understand the transition to AGI.” For the unaware, AGI or Artificial General Intelligence is the idea of creating a machine with human-level intelligence (or beyond), capable of general understanding and independent decision-making.According to the Reuters report, OpenAI's CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, who recently started, will be hiring a new chief people officer. In the meantime, the company’s chief strategy officer Jason Kwon will be running Villagra's function, the company said.Julia Villagra joined the ChatGPT maker in February last year as the head of human resources. She was later promoted to the position of chief people officer in March 2025.In another news, OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor recently likened the current AI boom to the dot-com era, cautioning that not all companies will succeed despite the hype and massive investments. He emphasizes that long-term success in AI depends on providing real-world utility, responsible deployment, and scalable infrastructure. Companies focused on solving practical problems, rather than chasing trends, are more likely to become leaders.He added that the long-term success in AI will hinge on real-world utility, responsible deployment, and scalable infrastructure.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain drops mandate for apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of american citizens.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses.

A German town's bid to break China's grip on rare earths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/a-german-towns-bid-to-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/articleshow/123421532.cms,"Representative image

Struggling despite strategic potential



The holy grail of the high-tech economy

A cleaner shortcut



No silver bullet







With its orchards of low-growing fruit trees and a harbor dotted with yachts, Bitterfeld has an air of pastoral charm. But this former East German town, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) southwest of Berlin, also has a less bucolic side.A shallow lake called the Silbersee is a reminder of a disused lignite mine that once provided fuel, while a tangle of pipes from one of Germany's oldest chemical facilities has long added an industrial twist to the skyline.Recently, this town of two tales has taken on a third persona, quietly emerging as a hub for the EU's drive to source rare earths on home turf.Vital to the manufacture of permanent magnets that show up in consumer electronics, renewables, and defense technologies, these chemical elements are largely sourced in China. As a result, Europe is dependent on exports — something it would like to change. Enter Bitterfeld.The idea is to recycle rare earth elements from end-of-life electronic devices. In May 2024, the family-run German tech group Heraeus opened its facility, a grey rectangular building shielded by a high barbed-wire fence, for that purpose.At its launch, the site was presented as ""the largest rare earth magnet recycling plant in Europe.""Initially, it aimed to produce around 600 tons of rare earth magnetic powder per year, with plans to double this figure to 1,200 tons in the near future. But that's not quite how things have panned out.A year after the launch, Heraeus says the facility is struggling to break even, despite the field's potential strategic importance.""I cannot disclose the exact number, but we are nowhere near full capacity,"" David Christian Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, told DW, adding that European recycling ""cannot compete"" with rare earth metal deliveries from China.Four industrial sectors in Germany are particularly dependent on rare earth imports: the automotive industry, mechanical and plant engineering, energy, and defense. One of the key minerals they need is neodymium.Found in countless smart devices, from electric motors and wind turbines to MRI scanners and smartphone speakers, this silvery-white metal is the holy grail of the high-tech economy. The element, primarily in the form of neodymium-iron-boron magnets, is also crucial for military applications.""These magnets are used in precision-guided weapons, radar and sonar systems, satellite communications, and the acoustic signature reduction on military vehicles,"" Stefan Steinicke from the Federation of German Industries (BDI) told DW.Although Europe possesses some reserves, it does not currently mine neodymium. In fact, the continent imports 100% of its heavy rare earth elements (REEs), such as terbium, and 85% of its light rare earth elements, including neodymium, from China. The country also produces 90% of the world's magnets.""When it comes to electric motors, robotics and drones, import dependency is not only high, but system-critical,"" Steinicke said.Short-term import stoppages lead to production delays, supply bottlenecks, and price hikes. Longer-term disruptions could result in project cancellations in key tech sectors and cause strategic uncertainty among investors.In April this year, China severely restrictedits exports of several heavy rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, leading to a drastic shortfall in Europe. In some parts of Germany, production lines came to a standstill.In 2024, the EU introduced its Critical Raw Materials Act. By 2030, Europe aims to mine at least 10% of the raw materials it requires, process 40%, and recycle 25%. Dependence on any single non-EU country is to be reduced to a maximum of 65%.Experts welcome the targets but regard them as ambitious, saying the EU needs to move faster, make greater investments and be more creative with its policy tools.The mining-to-magnet production chain is long and costly. ""A green mine is an oxymoron. It always involves environmental degradation and pollution,"" said Pascal Leroy, Director General of the WEEE Forum, a Brussels-based non-profit focused on electronic waste.Short-loop recycling, in turn, uses vacuum melting, skipping the dirtiest, most energy-hungry steps found in the longer recycling loop. It is, therefore, held up as a cleaner alternative to mining.Aside from Heraeus Remloy, several other European companies are racing to lead in REE-recycling. But finding customers willing to pay extra to support European producers remains difficult.Jan Giese, a senior manager at TRADIUM, a German metal products distributor says the challenges are due to ""relatively high prices for interesting scrap material,"" higher European production costs, ""lower recycling capacities and resulting poorer economies of scale.""According to TRADIUM, the price of neodymium oxide has been gradually declining, albeit with certain volatility, since March 2022, reaching one of its low points around mid-2024. This further adds to recyclers' profitability struggles.So far, less than 1% of the rare earths consumed in the EU are recycled, Rüya Perincek, press officer at the EU Commission, told DW. And though Brussels has approved several projects to help tap private funding, it is not likely to tip the scales in any big way.Early next year, the EU is planning to launch a special platform connecting buyers and suppliers of strategic raw materials to diversify sourcing.""Recycling quotas could be part of a solution,"" Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary bloc, told DW.Highlighting the need for ""a coherent political effort that combines a mosaic of measures,"" he did not rule out a tax credit for magnets manufactured domestically or made from reclaimed components. Such steps, however, should be taken ""in close coordination within the EU,"" he added.Nearly 50% of all e-waste in the European Union remains uncollected, and less than 40% is recycled. The Commission plans to revise the WEEE Directive, an EU regulation on electronic waste management, to better align collection, treatment, and market incentives.According to Leroy, Brussels needs to introduce dedicated waste codes for permanent magnets so they can be traced and recycled before going missing or being exported.Together with its partners, the WEEE Forum has also created an online Urban Mine Platform highlighting the volume of precious materials in EU waste — equivalent to roughly the weight of three million African elephants.Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, hopes to see a swift introduction of measures to boost the recycling of rare earth elements. He is calling for mandatory quotas and financial or tax incentives for using recycled European magnets, especially in the car industry.""The situation is very challenging... If nothing is done right now, I can't see any change happening by 2030,"" he added — despite the goals set in Brussels.","Europe imports 100% of its heavy rare earth elements (rees), such as terbium, from china. The continent imports 85% of the light rare earth elements, including neodymium. In may 2024, german tech group heraeus opened its facility, a grey rectangular building shielded by a high barbed-wire fence, for that purpose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123421570,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-953135,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
‘Racist’: Swatch ad outrages China; watchmaker apologises over ‘slant-eye’ gesture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/racist-swatch-ad-outrages-china-watchmaker-apologises-over-slant-eye-gesture/articleshow/123360241.cms,"Picture source: X





Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused swatch of racism and called for a boycott of its products.

The world's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced Friday in Beijing, featuring over 500 androids competing in events ranging from the 100-metre hurdles to kung fu. Hundreds of robotics teams from 16 countries vied for gold at the Chinese capital's National Speed Skating Oval, constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics.The games encompassed traditional sports such as athletics and basketball, alongside practical tasks including medicine categorisation and cleaning. ""I believe in the next 10 years or so, robots will be basically at the same level as humans,"" enthusiastic 18-year-old spectator Chen Ruiyuan told AFP.Human athletes may not be intimidated at this stage. During one of the initial events on Friday morning, five-aside football saw ten robots the size of seven-year-olds maneuver around the pitch, frequently becoming entangled in scrums or toppling over en masse.However, in a 1500-metre race, domestic champion Unitree's humanoids maintained an impressive pace, easily surpassing their competitors. The fastest robot AFP observed completed the race in 6:29:37, considerably slower than the human men's world record of 3:26:00. In one incident, a mechanical racer crashed into a human operator. The robot remained upright, while the human was knocked to the ground but did not appear to be injured.Robot competitions have been held for decades, but the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games marks the first to concentrate specifically on robots that resemble human bodies, organisers stated.The Chinese govt has invested heavily in robotics with the aim of leading the industry. Beijing has placed humanoids at the ""centre of their national strategy,"" the International Federation of Robotics stated in a paper on Thursday.""The govt wants to showcase its competence and global competitiveness in this field of technology,"" it added. Authorities are endeavouring to raise awareness of the sector across society.Cui Han, accompanying her 10-year-old son, told AFP that her son's school had organised and funded the trip to the Games. ""I hope it will encourage him to learn more about these new technologies,"" she said. In March, China announced plans for a one-trillion-yuan (approx Rs 1,22,000 crore) fund to support technology startups, including those in robotics and AI. The country is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, official statistics indicate, and in April, Beijing held what organisers described as the world's first humanoid robot half-marathon.","World's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced friday in beijing, featuring over 500 androids.
