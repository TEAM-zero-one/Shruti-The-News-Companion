Indian-origin Howard University professor says H-1B visas have no connection to US worker shortage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-howard-university-professor-says-h-1b-visas-have-no-connection-to-us-worker-shortage/articleshow/121276348.cms,"Howard professor Ron Hira weighed in on the recent H-1B uproar.





Howard University professor Ron Hira said H-1B visa programs that allow US companies to hire skilled labour from outside the country have no connection to merit or shortage of US workers for those specific jobs. Ron Hira, whose parents were Indians and came to the US on similar visas has long been a critic of the H-1b visa programs as he argued that companies misuse these programs to outsource cheaper employees instead of giving work to US graduates. In 2016, he gave a testimony in the Senate on immigration and detailed that both his parents were from India and his wife is an India-born. And hence to testify against this visa program was very meaningful to him personally.Amid the ongoing H-1B row, triggered by the release of the latest H-1B figures of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Roh Hira said that H-1B workers get selected by a random lottery and not the best and brightest. The USCIS revealed that the administration selected 120,141 H-1B visa applications for 2026, which is the lowest since 2021, but US tech workers claim that the number is huge given the massive layoffs that are happening in companies.USCIS makes selections by lottery every year when the agency receives more H-1B electronic registrations than permitted. The annual H-1B limit is 65,000 plus a 20,000 exemption for individuals with an advanced degree from a US university.The H-1B figures for 2026 have puzzled MAGA, as they expected a crackdown on H-1B from the Donald Trump administration. During the major H-1B row that involved Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy supporting the program, President Donald Trump said he was in favor of H-1B, though he has taken a stern stance on illegal immigration.Republican leader Virgil Bierschwale questioned whether the 2026 H-1B figures reveal that the employers have already chosen the employees they will fire as no new jobs are being created.""This 2026 visa approval gets me. Over a year ahead of the current date, they already have approved visas. And they must have a job to have a visa. Which means the employer has already picked out the employee they plan on firing since they are not creating new jobs. How is this not fraud at every level?"" Bierschwale wrote.""A huge chunk of H-1B petitions are for jobs that don’t even exist. Indian IT body shops are notorious for hoarding H-1B workers, hoping to lease them out later. If there’s no client, they get “benched”—which is illegal. But exploiting desperate migrants is a business model too profitable to quit,"" X handle US Tech Workers wrote.","Ron hira, whose parents were indians and came to the us on similar visas has long been a critic of the h-1b visa programs.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath warns: ‘India is at the epicentre of the global…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-co-founder-and-ceo-nithin-kamath-warns-india-is-at-the-epicentre-of-the-global/articleshow/121185441.cms,"

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and ceo nithin kamath took to microblogging platform x (formerly twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in india.

"Went hands-on with Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge, and it’s the haute couture of phones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/reviews/went-hands-on-with-samsungs-galaxy-s25-edge-and-its-the-haute-couture-of-phones/articleshow/121266099.cms,"

Barely there, fully here

Expect the unexpected



The price conundrum

True elegance, as the fashion world knows, lies in the perfect silhouette, and Samsung has translated that ethos into the Galaxy S25 Edge . When the company first teased its super-thin phone in January, many scoffed. In an age of ever-larger batteries and camera arrays, who would choose artful minimalism over raw practicality? And yet here we are, four months on, holding the S25 Edge , still getting used to how different it feels. Its slender form cuts through the sea of look-alikes, reminding us that sometimes a quiet gesture leaves the deepest impression.The dimensions tell you it's thin, at 5.8mm, but numbers don't prepare you for how it actually feels in hand. It's almost disconcertingly light at just 163g, barely heavier than the much smaller standard S25 with its 6.2-inch display. This phone manages a magic trick that photos simply can't convey. In isolated images, it looks like any other sleek Samsung slab. It's only when placed beside other phones that the dimensional difference becomes apparent. Put it next to some of the phones nearby, and the Edge appears almost impossibly slim, like something from a concept render rather than a production device.What's most remarkable is how this lightness transforms the experience of using a large-screen phone. The 6.7-inch display is identical in size to the S25 Plus, but the drastically reduced weight makes one-handed use far less fatiguing. My wrists didn't ache after extended scrolling sessions, and the phone practically disappeared in my pocket, a welcome change from the brick-like presence of most modern flagships.Samsung hasn't compromised on durability despite the slim profile. The Edge uses the same titanium frame as the S25 Ultra, which feels cool and premium to the touch. It's also the first phone to feature Corning's new Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, which promises enhanced crack resistance, though it lacks the anti-reflective properties of the Ultra's Gorilla Armor 2 coating. Add in the expected IP68 water and dust resistance, and this is a surprisingly robust device despite its delicate appearance.The camera housing is a curious departure from Samsung's recent design language, unlike the other S25 models with their visually cohesive camera arrays, the Edge sports a unique dual-lens setup that looks distinctly different. It's an odd break in Samsung's usually consistent family design, and similarly odd break in Samsung’s usually consistent habit of putting in a telephoto lens in Galaxy S phones, as the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn’t have one (more on that a few paragraphs later.)Thin phones used to mean less. The Edge changes that. Beyond its dramatic dimensions, the S25 Edge is essentially built from parts of its siblings. Samsung seems to have cherry-picked elements from across the S25 lineup to create something that sits between the Plus and Ultra in both features and price.From the Galaxy S25 Ultra , it inherits the 200MP main camera sensor and titanium frame. From the S25 Plus, it takes the identical 6.7-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate and those perfectly flat edges. And from the base S25, it borrows the slower 25W charging and, unfortunately, a smaller-than-expected battery.Under the hood, you'll find the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset powering the entire S25 lineup, paired with a generous 12GB of RAM. And all that AI that’s Samsung flaunts for other of its S25 phones, that’s also here.One thing that Samsung couldn’t help cutting is the battery. Speaking of which, the 3,900mAh cell is perhaps the Edge's most concerning specification. It's smaller than even the base S25's 4,000mAh battery, despite powering a significantly larger display. Samsung claims up to 24 hours of video playback, but that's still five hours less than the S25 and six less than the Plus. Time will tell whether the Edge can make it through a full day of real-world usage.The another obvious sacrifice is in the camera department. The Edge sports just two rear lenses: that impressive 200MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide. There's no telephoto lens whatsoever, which feels like a significant omission for a ever-so-premium phone in 2025. Samsung has attempted to compensate leveraging that high-resolution main sensor for 2x zoom crops, although the digital zoom is limited to 10x (compared to 30x on other S25 models). There's no getting around the versatility hit.The Edge does gain one unique feature over its siblings, though — Log video recording through the 12MP selfie camera, which even the Ultra doesn't offer. It's an interesting addition that content creators might appreciate, though it feels like an odd exclusive feature.This is where the plot thickens, just slightly . The Galaxy S25 Edge comes at Rs 109,999, positioning it firmly as a premium flagship. That places it above the Rs 99,999 S25 Plus and just short of the Ultra’s Rs 1,29,999 price tag, creating a somewhat awkward position in Samsung's lineup.For that premium, you're primarily paying for the engineering achievement and the unique experience of an ultra-thin, ultra-light phone with a large display. Whether this premium is justified will largely depend on how much you value the Edge's singular design achievement.After my brief time with the device, I can say the experience of using something this thin and light is genuinely refreshing, a distinctive departure from the increasingly homogeneous phone landscape. But whether that novelty translates into practical benefits during day-to-day use remains to be seen, and if you’re someone who’s waiting to know the same, you should probably wait for our full review.","The galaxy s25 edge is a super-thin phone that's almost disconcertingly light at just 163g.

No, it's more about AI and automation. Yes, cost-cutting is the main reason.

Management layers targeted despite ""delayering"" claims



Microsoft's recent round of layoffs has hit software engineers hardest, with over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state belonging to coding professionals, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.The Microsoft announced Tuesday it would cut around 6,000 workers company-wide, representing less than 3% of its 228,000-person workforce. The Washington state data represents roughly one-third of the total layoffs.Project management roles were also significantly impacted, with product management and technical program management positions accounting for nearly 30% of Washington cuts, Bloomberg reports.AI tools reshaping developer workforce.The layoffs come as Microsoft invests heavily in artificial intelligence technology that's beginning to automate aspects of software development. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects.""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said.The company has been scrutinizing costs while simultaneously pouring billions into AI infrastructure, with approximately $80 billion allocated for data center spending this fiscal year.Although Microsoft framed the cuts as an effort to ""reduce management layers,"" Bloomberg's analysis shows only about 17% of those laid off in Washington were classified as managers—roughly equivalent to their representation in the company's overall workforce.The cuts also affected some AI project managers, according to a person familiar with the matter, while relatively few customer-facing employees in sales and marketing were impacted.Microsoft joins other tech companies reshaping their workforces around AI capabilities. Salesforce plans to reduce engineering hiring in 2025 due to AI usage, while Workday announced in February it would continue hiring in strategic AI areas despite broader cuts.Microsoft declined to comment on the specific distribution of layoffs across job categories.","Microsoft announced tuesday it would cut around 6,000 workers company-wide, representing less than 3% of its 228,000-person workforce.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda french gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to bill gates.

Apple Pay , one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025, affecting thousands of users across the United States. As per reports, the disruption, which began around 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time left many unable to make transactions, access their digital wallets, or use related services like Apple Cash and Apple Card. While Apple has since restored most of its services, the incident highlights the growing dependency on digital financial systems and the potential challenges they face.The first signs of the outage appeared when thousands of users began reporting issues on the popular outage tracking platform, Down Detector. At its peak, nearly 3,000 reports were logged, indicating a widespread problem affecting Apple Pay, Wallet, Cash, and Card services. Many users also took to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Bluesky to share their frustrations about being unable to complete routine transactions. Apple Pay is not available in India.For nearly two hours, Apple Pay and Wallet remained inaccessible for many, significantly impacting users who rely on the service for daily purchases, transportation, and peer-to-peer payments. This prompted many to seek alternative payment methods, with some noting the inconvenience of being unable to access ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which often depend on Apple Pay for quick transactions.Apple's official status page, which initially showed all systems as operational, eventually confirmed the widespread disruption. The page listed ongoing issues with Apple Pay, Apple Wallet, Apple Card, and Apple Cash, stating that ""some users may be experiencing issues with this service."" This acknowledgment came roughly an hour after the first reports surfaced, reflecting a delayed response to the problem.By late morning, Apple had updated its status page to indicate that Apple Cash and Apple Card services had returned to normal, while Apple Pay and Wallet continued to experience problems. Despite these updates, some users continued to report lingering issues, suggesting that the recovery process was not uniform across all regions or devices.As of 11:11 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple reported that all affected services, including Apple Pay and Wallet, had been restored. However, the company's status page provided no specific details about the cause of the outage or the steps taken to resolve it. Apple has not yet released an official statement addressing the incident, and requests for comment have so far gone unanswered.While the outage appears to be resolved for most users, some have continued to report sporadic connectivity issues, indicating that the recovery may still be ongoing for a subset of the user base. The incident also sparked renewed discussions online about the importance of having backup payment options, especially as digital payment systems become more deeply integrated into daily life.The timing of the outage, occurring on a Friday morning, likely added to the inconvenience for users attempting to pay bills, transfer funds, or make weekend plans. The incident also highlights the broader implications of relying on digital payment systems, which, while convenient, can leave users vulnerable to sudden disruptions.Given the scale and duration of the outage, Apple Pay's temporary unavailability serves as a reminder of the critical role digital payment platforms now play in global commerce. It also underscores the need for robust backup systems and clear communication from service providers when technical issues arise.","Apple pay, one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on may 16, 2025.

As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone.

Apple’s Siri upgrades unlikely to be a major focus at WWDC 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apples-siri-upgrades-unlikely-to-be-a-major-focus-at-wwdc-2025/articleshow/121260452.cms,"Apple’s AI strategy and Siri’s delays

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next month. At the upcoming event Apple is expected Apple will host its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) from June 9 to 13, 2025, with the keynote taking place on June 9 at Apple Park, followed by developer sessions for the rest of the week. This year, Apple is expected to introduce the redesigned iterations of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, marking the most substantial visual overhaul since iOS 7. Now a new report suggests that significant upgrades to Siri are unlikely to be a central topic at WWDC this year. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reveals that this year Apple is expected to bring major software updates to iOS 19, but significant Siri upgrades may not be a focal point. In a long report, Gurman suggests that Apple is unlikely to discuss much about Siri’s future, despite previous promises of AI-driven enhancements.The report suggests that Apple was somewhat unprepared for the rapid emergence of generative AI, and that internal reluctance to invest heavily in AI development has led to Siri falling behind. Gurman notes that Apple’s software chief, Craig Federighi, was initially reluctant to prioritize AI, believing it would distract from core product development. This hesitation contributed to delays in Siri’s evolution, leaving Apple trailing behind competitors like Google Assistant and ChatGPT.“Other leaders shared Federighi’s reservations. “In the world of AI, you really don’t know what the product is until you’ve done the investment,” another longtime executive says. “That’s not how Apple is wired. Apple sits down to build a product knowing what the endgame is,” said Gurman in his report.While Apple has been working on a new AI-powered Siri infrastructure, dubbed LLM Siri, the company is reportedly separating Siri from its broader Apple Intelligence branding due to the assistant’s poor reputation. The goal is to rebuild Siri’s capabilities while managing public expectations.","Apple is expected to host its annual developer conference from june 9 to 13, 2025.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai calls R1 ‘impressive’

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, a former AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested the hype may be overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella has praised chinese ai startup deepseek's flagship model, r1.

Spain has ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules, the consumer rights ministry said Monday.The ministry said that many of the 65,935 Airbnb listings it had ordered to be withdrawn did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. Others listed numbers that didn't match what authorities had.Spain is grappling with a housing affordability crisis that has spurred government action against short-term rental companies.In recent months, tens of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets protesting rising housing and rental costs, which many say have been driven up by holiday rentals on platforms like Airbnb that have proliferated in cities like Madrid and Barcelona and many other popular tourist destinations.""Enough already with protecting those who make a business out of the right to housing,"" Consumer Minister Pablo Bustinduy told reporters on Monday.Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.The ministry said it had notified Airbnb of the noncompliant listings months ago, but that the company had appealed the move in court.Spain's government said Madrid's high court had backed the order sent to Airbnb on Monday. Bustinduy said it involved the immediate removal of 5,800 rental listings from the site. Subsequent orders would be issued until the nearly 66,000 removals were reached, he said.Airbnb could not be immediately reached for comment.Spain's government said the first round of rentals affected were located across the country, including in the capital, Madrid, as well as in the regions of Andalusia and Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona.","Spain orders airbnb to block nearly 66,000 holiday rental listings over rule violations.
