MUMBAI: Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the Dharavi redevelopment plan, yielding revenues of Rs 1.2-1.7 lakh crore for the joint venture between the state government and the Adani group Said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group, ""At a rough estimate, the Dharavi redevelopment project presents the builder with about 140 million sq.ft. of overall saleable area for sale on the open market, with a separate allotment for rehabilitation of the current inhabitants. We are roughly looking at over Rs 1 lakh crore of gross revenue. The anticipated profit margins are anywhere between 18-25%. It is also important to note that the Dharavi redevelopment project permits the developer to monetize TDR, or Transferable Development Rights, as well as commercial spaces. ''Nav Bharat Mega Developers is a special purpose vehicle between the Adani Group and the state for Dharavi's revamp. Total rehab cost including housing units for eligible beneficiaries and other for affordable rental housing is projected at Rs 95,790 crore, of which construction cost will be Rs 23,800 crore. This factors in the cost of building and handing over 72,000 units free of cost (residential rehab units, residential renewal units, commercial and industrial rehab units and commercial renewal units).Since 270 acres have been demarcated as net developable area, all the land left over after providing 72,000 units will be available to develop in the free sale component.Pankaj Kapoor, MD of Liases Foras, a realty research firm, said he expects profit margins to be 25-30%. ""This is on a projected revenue of Rs 1.2 lakh crore to Rs 1.7 lakh crore from the sale component at average market price of Rs 25,000 a sq ft,'' he added.""Projected saleable area is expected to range between 40.7 million sq ft and 60 million sq ft, depending on extent of FSI utilized for the rehabilitation portion,"" said Kapoor.However, he cautioned that the project's seven-year completion timeline was ""highly ambitious''. ""To stay on track, achieving annual sales of approximately 6.5 to 9 million sq ft will be a challenge and necessitate highly competitive pricing,'' he said.Architect Alan Abraham said at Rs 95,000-plus crore, the Dharavi project is cheaper than the bullet train, only 3x the cost of Mumbai Metro 3 and 6x the cost of the coastal road. ""It seems really inexpensive to transform our city centre, to better the lives of millions of our citizens. If the development of Dharavi is so important to our city, then I wonder why the government couldn't just do this themselves - while keeping these and the additional lands public, and earning all the revenue from the TDR,'' he said. ""In my opinion, the sale price of the Dharavi project will exceed those in Bandra-Kurla Complex, and perhaps even Linking Road,'' he added.Aditya Thackeray, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader, said the Adani Group was given incentives for this project in the form of 1,300 acres across the city free. ""BMC is being denied a premium of Rs 7,500 crore for its land and the TDR incentive."" He said the MVA government showed a better model of redevelopment for BDD chawls through a government agency.","Property experts estimate a free sale component of roughly 140 million sq ft to be unlocked by the dharavi redevelopment plan.

New York Jets ’ Jermaine Johnson calls out ‘Court Dreams’ company over unfulfilled project







New York Jets edge rusher Jermaine Johnson has accused a company he hired to work on a personal project of ripping him off—losing around $60,000 in the process. In a series of tweets on X (formerly Twitter), Jermaine Johnson alleged that the company, which was called ‘Court Dreams,’ took his entire payment at the beginning for a job that is still not done.New York Jets' linebacker Jermaine Johnson publicly denounced a sports construction business after reporting that he was swindled out of $60,000, going to social media to warn others and recount his experience with the now-private company.The New York Jets' 2022 first-round draft choice wasn't shy on social media, calling out the company and advising others not to do business with it. Although Jermaine Johnson didn't detail exactly what kind of work he hired them to do, the company's Instagram indicates they do specialty courts, turf installations, and pool construction and market themselves as the ‘#1 Sports Construction Firm.’“Beware of this man and this company,” Jermaine Johnson wrote on X. “He has stolen roughly $60K of my money by not completing a job I regretfully paid full price for before completion.”Johnson said he was urged to hire the company after getting favorable word-of-mouth recommendations from public figures and friends. Nevertheless, he now wishes he had not paid the full advance. After numerous attempts to reach the company for a refund or project completion, Johnson said he's been given 'the runaround' for over a year.“He's been giving me the runaround for over a year now when I ask about either a refund or just for the work to be completed. I had recommendations from friends and other celebrities that used him, which is why I felt comfortable paying upfront. Lesson learned by me but this guy will steal your money [shake my head],” Johnson said, venting frustration that he can't tag the company because it isn't on X. Within hours of his messages going viral, the company's Instagram account was made private. Fans also joined the discussion, tracking down the company and posting messages of support for the 26-year-old linebacker.Also read: Mikko Rantanen trade sends a powerful message about Dallas stars ambition It looks like Johnson's newest fight off the field illustrates the real-life weaknesses professional athletes are vulnerable to, even when conducting business off the field.","New york jets linebacker jermaine johnson publicly denounced a sports construction business after reporting that he was swindled out of $60,000.

Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","Linkedin is laying off 281 employees across california, a report claims.

What Steve Bannon thinks about H-1B





Donald Trump's former aide Steve Bannon shot to the centerstage Friday as the Trump administration's recent visa decisions were seen as a victory of the Bannon camp. Bannon, an avid hater of the H-1B visa programs that allows US companies to hire foreign talent, quickly reacted to the accolades, as he wrote, ""Next Victory: H1B Visa Scam"".A POLITICO report gave the verdict that it was the Bannon camp's win over the tech camp as Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration would now revoke the visas of Chinese students. The Silicon Valley camp would definitely not like this decision as 70 per cent of Silicon Valley's highly educated tech employees are from overseas and China supplies more than any country except India, the report said noting how silent the tech industry is on this major policy change -- though very little has been shared by Rubio.Meta, Google, Microsoft and NVidia formally declined to comment to POLITICO and it said Tesla, Amazon and Apple did not respond to its emails.""The visa move looks like another win for the Bannon wing,"" the report gave its verdict.Steve Bannon has openly called the H-1B program a scam. Openly declaring a war against Elon Musk, he called for an end to the program. Bannon thinks H-1B is a scam of the highest order that deprives Americans of their jobs.Reacting to the USCIS's latest approval of over 120,000 H-1B applications for 2026, Steve Bannon said it's outrageous at a time when AI is posing a threat to US jobs. ""The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO. Everyone issued one should go home, and every billet should be filled by an American,"" Bannon said. The recent layoffs announced by companies, including Walmart, have been linked to the H-1B and US tech workers are demanding H-1B ban.",Us crackdown on chinese students' visa is seen as a victory of the bannon camp.

China Vs U.S. World War Over Golden Dome? Trump Warned Against Opening 'Pandora's Box'





European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices, according to an annual survey released Wednesday. Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the United States over surging exports.""The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,"" the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey 2025.The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand.The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets.In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ.The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidised electric vehicle production.""I think there's a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,"" Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week.He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn't outpace that in demand.The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February.""It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,"" he said.","European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in china.

Revised Canadian policy eases job transitions for foreign workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/revised-canadian-policy-eases-job-transitions-for-foreign-workers/articleshow/121516870.cms,"



In a significant move aimed at better utilizing the skills of temporary foreign workers already within the country, the Canadian government has introduced a new temporary public policy. This initiative that was signed on March 4, comes into force from May 27. It allows foreign nationals in Canada to change jobs more quickly, even before their new work permit application is fully processed.Previously, foreign workers seeking to switch employers or occupations often faced lengthy delays, sometimes several weeks, while awaiting a new work permit. This waiting period led to financial instability for workers and frustration for Canadian employers keen to fill urgent labour and skills gaps. Now, temporary foreign workers already in Canada, who have a job offer either through the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program or the International Mobility Program can begin their new roles more quicklyThe Canadian government acknowledges that temporary foreign workers play a vital role in the Canadian economy. However, circumstances can arise where an existing employment contract is no longer viable. This could be due to various reasons, such as a new role with the same employer, layoffs, workplace conflict, or simply the pursuit of better compensation or professional growth opportunities with a different company.""It is imperative to better utilize the skills and training of the temporary foreign workers already here,"" states a recently updated post on the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).""This policy offers workers a viable and timely alternative to change employers if they need to do so"" adds the post.Speaking to the TOI, Kubeir Kamal, a regulated Canadian immigration consultant (RCIC) said, “The temporary public policy from IRCC, allows temporary foreign workers, including many from the Indian community, to change employers without needing a new work permit while their application is processed. This would specifically apply to the closed work permit holders in Canada.”“Indian workers, who form a significant portion of Canada’s temporary foreign workforce (over one lakh work permits were issued to Indian nationals in 2022), often hold employer-specific (close) work permits in sectors like IT, healthcare, caregiving, and agriculture. This policy allows them to switch jobs without waiting for a new permit, reducing downtime and enabling pursuit of better opportunities, such as higher-paying roles or positions with career advancement,” he added.Meanwhile, Jamil Jivani, a member of the Canadian Parliament from the Conservative party, apparently acting suo moto, has launched a petition to end the TFW Program. He blames it for high immigration numbers, taking jobs from Canadians, lowering wages and putting an additional burden on infrastructure.The re-elected Liberal party in August last year had announced restrictive measures for hiring temporary foreign workers. These included a cap on the number of TFWs that can be hired, and reduction in the duration of employment for workers hired under the low-wage stream to one year, from two years.","The canadian government has introduced a new temporary public policy.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi , his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals from participating in securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years. This action follows their involvement in deceptive YouTube videos that encouraged share purchases of Sadhna Broadcast.The regulatory body has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti, alongside a one-year securities market prohibition, according to Sebi's directive issued on Thursday.Additionally, the regulator has imposed financial penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on 57 other parties, including the promoters of Sadhna Broadcast (presently known as Crystal Business System Ltd).The regulatory body has instructed all 59 entities to return collective illegal profits of Rs 58.01 crore, with an additional 12 per cent annual interest, to be paid jointly until the complete settlement from the investigation conclusion.According to Sebi's findings, Arshad accumulated profits of Rs 41.70 lakh, whilst his wife gained Rs 50.35 lakh from these activities.The conclusive order identified Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta and Manish Mishra as the primary orchestrators of this scheme.The order also revealed that Subhash Aggarwal, a director of SBL's RTA, served as an intermediary between Manish Mishra and the promoters.These people were the key figures who orchestrated and implemented the deceptive plan, according to Sebi.Additionally, Sebi noted that Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah allowed their controlled accounts to be utilised for the fraudulent strategies of Manish Mishra and SBL's promoters.As a dealer at Choice and owner of the stockbroker's Delhi franchise respectively, they played crucial roles in enabling extensive manipulation of the scrip.Jatin Shah was instrumental in implementing the scheme, whilst other parties either supported the fraudulent activities or participated for quick profits, as stated in the order.According to the 109-page directive, Sebi indicated that the noticees acted as information intermediaries or helped execute manipulative trades, without trading the scrip through their personal accounts.Sebi explained that the organised scheme was carried out in two coordinated stages. Initially, connected and promoter-associated entities conducted trades amongst themselves to gradually increase the scrip price and create artificial market activity.The small-volume transactions had an outsized effect on pricing, primarily due to limited market liquidity. This enabled the involved parties to elevate the share value whilst deploying minimal trading resources.Subsequently, promotional content was broadcast via various YouTube platforms including 'Moneywise', 'The Advisor', and 'Profit Yatra', which were under Manish Mishra's management, as stated in the directive.These video presentations portrayed SBL as an attractive investment prospect and were strategically released to complement and enhance the orchestrated market activities.","Sebi has imposed monetary penalties of rs 5 lakh each on warsi and goretti.

MUMBAI: Sebi on Friday banned 59 entities, including actor Arshad Warsi , his wife Maria Goretti, from the market for up to 5 years. The move is related to misleading videos on YouTube channels - like Moneywise, The Advisor and Profit Yatra - luring investors to buy TV channel Sadhna Broadcast's shares. The markets regulator fined the couple Rs 10 lakh, and they will have to disgorge illegal gains worth Rs 92 lakh from the stock price manipulation.Warsi and his wife Goretti played a role in promoting the stock of Sadhna (now Crystal Business System) through videos on YouTube, which were uploaded by one of the masterminds of the scheme.In its 109-page order, Sebi whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia stated that the way the whole incident played out painted ""a disturbing picture regarding the increasing use of social media platforms, which have immense reach and influence in the digital age, as tools for market manipulation"". Sebi ordered disgorgement of illegal gains totalling about Rs 58 crore and imposed fines of up to Rs 5 crore on the entities. The overall conduct of the people involved in the scheme revealed a classic pump-and-dump scheme, the report said.""The price was systematically pushed upward through collusive trading, followed by aggressive promotional activity to draw in retail investors, and finally, a coordinated sell-off by the promoters.Retail investors, misled by this staged market activity, were left holding the shares at distorted valuations once the manipulators, including the promoters, exited,"" the report said.Sebi found that three individuals, Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta, and Manish Mishra, were the masterminds.

It fell 48% over April (CY2025) at $2.9 billion and plunged by $2.3 billion when compared with May last year (CY2024) at $3.8 billion. The investments as on May 30, 2025, exclude those from the real estate sector.“Buyouts have been a key driver of the value of PE investments in recent years. Even in the first quarter of 2025, global PE firms like KKR and TPG, as well as home grown firms like Multiples PE and Everstone have executed significant such control transactions. The pace of large buyout announcements have significantly slowed down in the last couple of months - contributing to the decline in PE investment value,” Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence told TOI. Assuming the global economic turbulence settles down, we can expect more confident bets by both Indian and international investors, he added.In May, Porter, an on-demand logistics platform, raising $200 million in a Series F round led by Kedaara Capital and Wellington Management topped the PE-VC investments. It was followed by private equity fund Norwest announcing that it has led a Rs 1,465-crore investment in the non-bank lender IKF Finance.Growth in the PE-VC investment sector was also flat during the Jan-May period of CY2025 at $13.5 billion against $13.2 billion during the corresponding period last year, data released by research firm Venture Intelligence on Friday showed. It was dominated by institutional investments in late stage companies that are more than 10 years old at $3.9 billion.Apart from global macro uncertainty, factors including shift in investors sentiment, who are being more cautious with capital deployment influenced investments, according to analysts.Ashutosh Kumar Jha- general partner at Expert Dojo, a US-based startup accelerator and VC firm said, many VC and PE funds have shifted their focus from volume to value. “These dips aren’t always bad news. Sometimes, they just mean investors are thinking harder about where to place their bets.”Noting that dominance of late-stage deals indicate that investors are doubling down on companies that have proven business models and closer to profitability or IPOs, he said, “Growth looks flat, but this phase could be laying the groundwork for a healthier and more disciplined investment cycle in the second half of the year,” he added.","Private equity-venture capital (pe-vc) investments in may witnessed a sharp fall.
