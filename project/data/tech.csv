First for India: Startup edges closer to launch of its inflatable Space habitat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-for-india-startup-edges-closer-to-launch-of-its-inflatable-space-habitat/articleshow/127669003.cms,"BENGALURU: A Bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for India, by completing key tests in Switzerland, enabled through its partners, including the European Space Agency (Esa).Akashlabdhi, a startup incubated at IISc, is now planning to launch a scaled-down version of the inflatable habitat, “AntarikshHAB”, designed for future human missions, in July. Conventional space habitats, like the International Space Station (ISS), have long grappled with issues of scalability, cost-efficiency, and limited living space.“Unlike what was done with ISS, or what is being planned for future space stations, AntarikshHAB can be launched as a compact habitat which will later inflate in space. In July, we will be launching a habitat that will be 70 cubic metres while the final habitat we are planning to develop will be around 300 cubic meters,” Akashlabdhi CEO Siddarth Jena told TOI.The July mission, to be launched aboard a vehicle provided by Spanish firm PLD Space, is designed as more than a brief technology demonstration. In addition to deploying the inflatable module in orbit, the plan includes a controlled de-orbit and atmospheric re-entry.“Post-flight inspection of recovered material is expected to yield data on degradation, survivability and end-of-life behaviour, areas that are increasingly important as regulators and space agencies stress responsible operations in low Earth orbit,” Jena said.For its programme, Akashlabdhi has collaborated with multiple European organisations, including Versuchsstollen Hagerbach (VSH) and the Amberg Group. “The programme is supported through grants and institutional participation from Esa and its partners, enabling the establishment of a dedicated Human Habitat Safety and Research & Development facility at VSH Hagerbach in Switzerland,” Jena said.The underground lab, operated by Amberg Group, provides a controlled environment with substantial natural rock overburden, allowing for realistic studies of radiation attenuation, structural integrity, isolation effects, and long-duration habitat performance under conditions that are difficult to replicate using surface-based facilities.“To advance our system to Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6), a comprehensive test campaign was conducted. This included pressure and leak-before-burst tests on multi-layer flexible structures, thermal cycling and accelerated ageing of materials, and impact testing to simulate micrometeoroid and orbital debris strikes. Repeated deployment trials have also been carried out to assess the reliability of restraint and inflation mechanisms,” Jena said.These activities are supported by an integrated sensor network feeding into a digital twin framework, enabling real-time correlation between measured performance and predictive safety models.“Academic and research participation forms a core pillar of the collaboration. On the Indian side, IISc, IIT-Roorkee, and IIT-Delhi are contributing expertise in space structures, materials, systems engineering, and human-centric design. Swiss participation includes ETH Zurich, EMPA, and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), working alongside Esa-linked research activities to support materials science, radiation studies, and advanced validation methodologies,” Jena said.Akashalabdhi leads overall habitat architecture, systems engineering and mission design, while the Amberg Group brings decades of experience in underground safety engineering and certification-oriented testing. The partnership, both sides say, is an attempt to apply proven terrestrial safety principles to the emerging domain of orbital infrastructure.Felix Amberg, president of the board of Amberg Group, said: “The collaboration is an extension of established civil and underground engineering principles into the domain of space systems, highlighting the value of combining underground safety validation with orbital deployment and recovery.”Beyond the immediate technical goals, the project is also being seen as a marker of closer cooperation between India and Switzerland, and more broadly with EFTA nations, in high-technology research.","A bengaluru-based startup has moved a step closer towards launching an inflatable space habitat, a first for india.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in india is usually framed through “lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

Bouncing Back From Failure

BENGALURU: India was to ring in its 2026 space calendar with a launch that quietly captured the direction the sector is now taking. The PSLV-C62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on Jan 12. Notwithstanding that setback, 2026 is still shaping up as the year when India’s private sector can show results in orbit.Just eight days after the PSLV mission, the country’s first Earth Observation Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP saw a key milestone with the signing of a concession agreement that allows the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground, four months after it won the project from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)The agreement was between IN-SPACe and Allied Orbits — the special purpose vehicle (SPV) created by the consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space — at the former’s office in Bengaluru.TOI reported earlier in Aug 2025 that the Pixxel-led consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes saw it signed on Jan 20.The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, data from which will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium will implement the project through Allied Orbits. “As part of the project, PierSight will build synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, Pixxel will build hyperspectral & high resolution optical satellite, Satsure will make multispectral satellites and Dhruva will develop ground stations,” Gaurav Seth, Piersight CEO and co-founder told TOI.Pixxel CEO Awais Ahmed toldthat their firm was “implementing 60% of the project and investing the same amount to boot.""“Of the 12 satellites, seven will come from Pixxel, three from SatSure and two from PierSight,” Awais said, adding that Pixxel will build two types of satellites: Five of them will be ultra high-res submeter satellite and two will be hyperspectral satellites.Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create the 12-satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.Aside from this, three private entities will also produce 31 satellites as part of the space-based surveillance (SBS) programme for India’s strategic needs to be used by national security agencies.This is the first time that private industry will be developing satellites for strategic needs. The current SBS programme — built upon the earlier avatars that have seen satellites from the Cartosat and Risat families — will further enhance India’s space surveillance capabilities and see a total of 52 satellites in both geostationary orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO).Twenty-one of these satellites will be developed by Isro and the other 31 will come from the private sector. Together, the project is to cost an estimated Rs 26,000-Rs 27,000 crore — this is expected to be revised.The latest iteration marks a substantial upgrade from its predecessors, incorporating artificial intelligence to enable unprecedented satellite interaction and intelligence gathering.A key innovation of the current SBS will be its integrated network of satellites positioned in both LEO and GEO. This dual-layer system will allow for dynamic cooperation between satellites, with GEO satellites at 36,000km able to detect activities and direct LEO satellites at 400-600km to provide detailed observations.The programme is expected to allocate dedicated satellites to support land, sea, and air-based missions across India’s military services, enhancing the nation’s defense capabilities.At a time India’s aspirations of having a sustainable human presence in space is taking shape in the form of Gaganyaan and Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS) programmes, Bengaluru start-up Akashalabdhi is working on an “expandable space habitat”.A prototype model of the habitat dubbed ‘Antariksh HAB’ is ready. The final version is being designed to accommodate six to 16 personnel and will have an innovative structure that promises superior protection against orbital debris and radiation while boasting versatility.Beyond this single launch, 2026 is expected to see the first large-scale realisation of India’s private launch ambitions.Skyroot Aerospace remains among the most closely watched startups. In late 2025, the company unveiled its Vikram-I orbital rocket along with its “Infinity Campus” in Hyderabad, a facility designed to support parallel rocket design, manufacturing and testing.In 2026, Skyroot aims to conduct its first commercial orbital launch, placing small satellites into low-Earth orbit. The company has indicated an initial cadence of one launch every three months, with plans to scale to monthly missions by 2027. Revenue generation is expected to begin once regular commercial operations are established.Success would mark a turning point: India’s first privately built orbital rocket, launched from Indian soil, carrying paying customer payloads rather than experimental technology demonstrators.Agnikul Cosmos, based in Chennai, is pursuing a different approach. Its launch vehicles are built around modular architectures and patented upper-stage designs that could double as orbital payloads. Internally, the company is targeting monthly launches once its first orbital mission is completed.Agnikul’s emphasis is on adaptability and production efficiency, with engines and stages designed for rapid manufacturing and lower per-mission costs, a potential advantage in an increasingly crowded global small-satellite launch market.Digantara operates in a niche that is gaining urgency worldwide: space domain awareness and orbital intelligence.The company specialises in tracking resident space objects, including debris and active satellites, using its own spacecraft, ground networks and data platforms. In 2025, it launched its first commercial space surveillance satellite, SCOT.In 2026, Digantara plans to deploy at least eight more satellites, primarily through rideshare missions on vehicles such as SpaceX’s Transporter series. It is also close to operationalising a ground-based telescope in India.As low-Earth orbit becomes more congested, such capabilities are increasingly critical, not only for commercial operators but also for defence and civil authorities responsible for collision avoidance and orbital safety.Bellatrix Aerospace has evolved from an early focus on launch vehicles to concentrate on propulsion systems and orbital transport technologies. Its portfolio includes electric propulsion thrusters for small satellites and an orbital transfer vehicle capable of repositioning spacecraft after launch.Recently, Bellatrix and Digantara both entered partnerships with Japan’s Astroscale, a global leader in debris removal and orbital servicing. These collaborations reflect how Indian hardware startups are increasingly plugging into international technology ecosystems.For satellite operators, such propulsion and servicing systems could become essential, enabling low-cost manoeuvring, orbit changes and mission life extension.India’s Earth observation (EO) sector is also entering a new phase. IN-SPACe’s Build–Own–Operate framework began transitioning into implementation in 2025, signalling a shift in how satellite infrastructure and data services are commercialised. It is under this push that Allied Orbits was formed.Separately, Pixxel has already placed its first private batch of hyperspectral imaging satellites in orbit through its Firefly series, serving agriculture, environmental monitoring and resource analysis.Other firms, including Satellize and Grahaa Space, are working on satellite manufacturing and data services, such as near-real-time geospatial video, which could serve both commercial users and strategic agencies.On the launch side, public–private partnership models are beginning to take concrete shape. The LVM-3 heavy-lift programme is being scaled with deeper industry involvement to support future commercial missions.The first PSLV manufactured by a HAL–L&T-led consortium is expected to fly in early 2026, marking a milestone in the industrialisation of India’s launch vehicle production.Technology transfer agreements for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), and eventually for PSLV manufacturing, are also expected to progress, as part of broader privatisation plans. On Jan 8, Dept of Space issued an EoI inviting industries to build the first module of the proposed Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS).Together, these steps point to a deliberate shift from a research-centric model to a market-driven space economy.Industry associations argue that private momentum will need stronger public backing to sustain scale. The Satcom Industry Association-India (SIA-India), in three coordinated pre-budget submissions prepared in collaboration with KPMG, pointed out that India’s public spending on space, at about 0.04% of GDP, remains well below global norms.It recommended a phased increase to levels closer to the 0.12% seen in leading spacefaring nations, with predictable support for launch capability, satellite constellations, navigation systems and testing infrastructure.SIA-India president Subba Rao Pavuluri said: “From secure communications and navigation to climate systems, launch infrastructure and disaster resilience, every layer of our national architecture now depends on space assets. Granting space the status of critical infrastructure and decisively expanding public investment is essential if we are to match our strategic aspirations and secure our leadership in the Indo-Pacific. ”The Indian Space Association (ISpA) echoed the sense of transition. “Private space startups in India raised nearly $150 million during FY 2025 taking the total funding to over $617 million till date… India’s space sector is moving firmly into an execution-led phase. While challenges remain in manufacturing scale, long-term capital access, and assured demand, the year established a clear foundation for sustained growth, deeper industry participation, and India’s expanding role in the global space economy,” said ISpA director-general Lt Gen (retd) A K Bhatt.Among the 15 satellites onboard PSLV-C62, 13 were from private industry, highlighting how commercial payloads are now becoming the norm rather than the exception on Indian launch vehicles. And the Indian companies that had their payloads and deployers on the rocket are also expected to bounce back.Dhruva Space, whose Polar Access-1 (PA-1), a structured launch programme that would have enabled 10 satellite deployments serving multiple Indian states and international customers, was lost, will aim to get back to orbit.One of the most closely watched payloads on the mission was AyulSat, built by OrbitAID Aerospace. The satellite was designed to demonstrate a technology that would eventually allow the firm to conduct a full-fledged on-orbit refuelling, a capability that could change how satellites are operated and maintained.Now, the firm is looking at launching both the target, and the chaser satellites together sometime later this year.","The pslv-c62, carrying a clear private sector imprint, however, failed on jan 12. 2026 is still shaping up as the year when india’s private sector can show results in orbit.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: In a move that may help India's high-emission industries navigate the EU's carbon border tax regime by adopting clean manufacturing processes in due course, Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070.The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods such as cement, aluminium, iron & steel and fertilisers that enter the 27 EU nations.If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will continue to attract tariff burden in the form of carbon border tax, impacting the country’s exports.The decarbonisation roadmaps for cement and aluminium, released by Niti Aayog last Wednesday, will also serve as reference manuals for India to decarbonise other sectors, in sync with the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Aayog’s report shows that cement manufacturing, a significant source of carbon emissions, contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e of emissions worldwide in 2023.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions, which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Under the decarbonisation strategy, as suggested by the roadmap, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13tCO₂e per tonne by 2070.To enable deep decarbonisation in this sector, the roadmap proposes to prioritise the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scale-up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme.Similarly, the decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies a three-phase solution: transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC), enhanced grid connectivity in the short term and adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The report reveals that production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023.",Niti aayog has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors.

WhatsApp security under lens: Elon Musk and Telegram CEO Pavel Durov criticizes WhatsApp as Meta faces lawsuit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-says-have-to-be-braindead-to-believe-whatsapp-is-secure/articleshow/127595598.cms,"Elon Musk criticizes Meta's WhatsApp

Head of WhatsApp Will Cathcart’s response to the allegations

Lawsuit filed against WhatsApp

What Meta said





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has said that an individual has to be “braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure”. The Russian billionaire’s comments come amid a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned WhatsApp in San Francisco, accusing it of accessing users' messages, contradicting end-to-end encryption (E2EE) promises. “You’d have to be braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure in 2026. When we analyzed how WhatsApp implemented its “encryption”, we found multiple attack vectors,” Pavel Durov wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter).In the post, Durov cited Telegram's internal analysis revealing unspecified ""attack vectors"" in WhatsApp's encryption implementation, though no public details have emerged, while WhatsApp's Signal Protocol has undergone independent audits confirming default E2EE.Telegram CEO was joined by Elon Musk in criticizing the instant messaing app. The Tesla CEO shared a post on X writing ""WhatsApp is not secure. Even Signal is questionable. Use X Chat."" Musk was responding to a post by DogeDesigner that quoted Bloomberg report about the lawsuit against Meta.WhatsApp head Will Cathcart took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share his response on the allegations. He wrote, ""This is totally false.WhatsApp can’t read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don’t have access to them. This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials.""As reported by Bloomberg, an international group of plaintiffs has filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for Northern California. It challenges Meta’s marketing of E2EE feature, a security standard which the company claims protects the messages on the app and ensures only the sender and recipient can read a message.The lawsuit claims that Meta’s privacy claims are false as the company WhatsApp “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users’ purportedly ‘private’ communications”. The plaintiffs represented users from India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and South Africa. It also alleges that the company retains the ability to decrypt and review the substance of messages for data analysis and internal monitoring.Calling the allegations “frivolous” and “absurd,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone confirmed that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs’ counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false.

From college student to social media star

A fresh start with a new look

Alix Earle has quickly become one of the most talked-about names in American pop culture. Known first for her viral TikTok presence and later for her high-profile relationship with NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios, the 25-year-old influencer is now back in the spotlight after being linked to Tom Brady. As curiosity grows, here is a closer look at who Alix Earle is and how she reached this moment.Alix Earle rose to fame while she was a student at the University of Miami. Her candid “Get Ready With Me” videos where she spoke openly about acne, dating, and college life, struck a chord with young audiences. Within months her following exploded across TikTok and Instagram, turning her into one of the most recognisable faces in influencer culture.Unlike many creators who focus on perfection, she built her brand around honesty. She often spoke about insecurities, breakouts, and mental health, which helped her build a loyal fan base. By 2024, she had become a regular on fashion week guest lists and a favourite for beauty and lifestyle brands.Earle’s personal life entered the spotlight when she began dating Braxton Berrios. She referred to him as “NFL Man” in several posts, and the couple appeared regularly in her content.However, fans noticed Berrios was absent from many major moments, including her run on Dancing with the Stars in 2025, where she reached the finals. In December 2025, reports confirmed the two had quietly split after nearly two years together.Days later, Earle addressed the breakup in an emotional TikTok video, admitting she felt “weird” being alone for the first time in a long while. She called it a period of growth, even as she admitted to feeling sad and unsettled.After the breakup became public, Earle debuted a new hairstyle with “wispy bangs” during Paris Fashion Week. Fans quickly read the change as a symbol of a fresh chapter. She attended major shows, drew attention for her fashion choices, and appeared more focused than ever on her career.At the same time, she opened up about family struggles, revealing that her mother was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. The update showed a more vulnerable side of the influencer, earning her widespread support.In recent weeks, her name has been linked to Tom Brady after the two were reportedly spotted in the same social circles. While neither has confirmed a relationship, the rumours alone have sparked major interest.The idea of the former NFL superstar being connected to one of social media’s biggest influencers has kept fans guessing. For now, Earle has stayed silent, choosing not to address the speculation publicly.Whether or not the Tom Brady rumours prove true, Alix Earle’s rise is already remarkable. From college TikToks to global fashion events and headline-making relationships, she has built a career that goes far beyond who she dates.","Alix earle rose to fame while she was a student at the university of miami.

India-EU Free Trade Agreement : India–EU FTA almost sealed: How much cheaper luxury cars could become,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/cars/indiaeu-fta-almost-sealed-how-much-cheaper-luxury-cars-could-become/articleshow/127605284.cms,"'Mother Of All Deals': PM Modi Signals New Global Trade Order As India And EU Seal Historic Pact

Discover everything about the automotive world at Times of India.

India’s long-pending free trade agreement with the European Union is close to being announced, Reuters reported. This deal could bring significant relief for buyers of imported luxury cars. According to the report, the deal will see India sharply reduce import duties on cars from EU countries, a move that could make premium models from brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen far more affordable over time.At present, India imposes import tariffs on fully built cars, with duties ranging from 70 percent to as high as 110 percent. Under the proposed India–EU FTA, these peak duties are expected to be brought down to 40 percent initially.As per a Reuters report, India has proposed cutting duties to 40 percent for up to around 200,000 internal combustion engine vehicles imported annually from the EU. The final quota is still under discussion and could be revised before the agreement is formally signed. Initially, the lower duty is likely to apply only to fully built cars priced above 15,000 euros, which is roughly Rs 16.3 lakh.Over the longer term, the agreement could lead to even deeper cuts.However, the benefits will not extend to electric vehicles in the early years. As per the report, EVs will be excluded from the reduced duty structure for at least the first five years, as the government looks to safeguard investments made by domestic manufacturers in the electric mobility space. Similar concessions for electric cars are expected to be considered at a later stage.The timing of the announcement is also significant. The proposed tariff cuts come as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is on a four-day visit to India, during which summit-level talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected.","India’s long-pending free trade agreement with the european union is close to being announced.

Meta denies allegations, calls lawsuit 'frivolous fiction'

Elon Musk , Paul Durov question WhatsApp's security claims





Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu has weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding WhatsApp's encryption claims, pointing to a fundamental conflict of interest in Meta's advertising-driven business model.His comments come after a lawsuit was filed in a US district court in San Francisco on Friday, accusing Meta of misleading billions of WhatsApp users about their privacy. The plaintiffs, from countries including Australia, India, Mexico, and South Africa, claim the company's end-to-end encryption is essentially a facade.""As a general principle, when you rely on ads based on user habits, privacy can never be the first priority. The conflict of interest is real and serious,"" Vembu wrote on X. He added that when public market pressure demands ever-greater profits to justify ""astronomical valuations,"" it becomes ""naive to assume that these companies will put user privacy first.""Meta has pushed back hard against the accusations. Communications director Andy Stone called the claims ""categorically false and absurd,"" stating that WhatsApp has used Signal protocol encryption for a decade.The company warned it plans to seek sanctions against the plaintiffs' lawyers.The lawsuit cites unnamed whistleblowers who allegedly reveal that Meta employees can request access to user messages through an internal system. According to the complaint, workers need only submit a task request to the engineering team, which grants access ""often without any scrutiny at all.""The controversy has drawn reactions from across the tech industry. Elon Musk warned users against WhatsApp, calling it insecure and even questioning Signal's reliability. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was characteristically blunt: ""You'd have to be braindead to believe WhatsApp is secure in 2026."" He claimed that Telegram's analysis of WhatsApp's encryption implementation revealed ""multiple attack vectors.""The 51-page lawsuit alleges that once Meta workers gain access, they can view messages in real-time through a widget, with no separate decryption required. Messages reportedly appear commingled with content from unencrypted sources, accessible from the moment users first activated their accounts.Vembu's critique stands out because it doesn't focus on technical specifics. Instead, he highlights the structural problem: a company that makes money by tracking user behaviour will always face pressure to prioritise data collection over privacy. His own company, Zoho, operates on a subscription model without advertising.The lawsuit is seeking class-action status and damages. Meta, meanwhile, has not issued a formal public statement beyond calling the legal action a ""frivolous work of fiction.""","Zoho ceo sridhar vembu questions whatsapp's privacy claims, citing meta's ad-driven model as a conflict of interest.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel taylor, 20, from rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iphone 17 pro max through giffgaff, with delivery handled by dpd.

(The writer was in Helsinki at the invitation of the Finnish govt)





Nokia taught a generation how to connect, Angry Birds became a national timepass, and KONE quietly lifts millions of Indians every day in offices and apartment towers. Now, the same country that once drove our everyday tech habits is pitching something bigger - a place to study, build and work in fields such as AI and deep tech. According to industry voices, Finland's need for skilled professionals - supported by govt policies seen as favourable for work mobility and startups - has opened up roles for the Indian youth in various fields, be it data science, machine learning, computer vision or generative AI.Laura Lindeman, senior director of 'Work in Finland' at Business Finland, says the country is not just hiring youths with experience in AI, but also investing to scale up its R&D. ""Finland is in the process of attracting top deep tech researchers and specialists in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, microelectronics, photonics, imaging and health tech. In addition to excellent opportunities for professional and personal development, experts working in Finland benefit from a strong national commitment to R&D. The country already invests 3.2% of its GDP in research and development, and govt aims to increase this share to 4% by 2030.For Indian candidates from these fields, this means more opportunities to access world-class research infrastructure and build careers in companies and universities that play a key role in driving global innovation,"" she adds.The message also came through at a recent AI summit in Turku, where the Finnish govt underlined its ambition to be a serious player in the global AI race, keeping international collaboration at the centre. PM Petteri Orpo described it as a strategic imperative. ""Europe must lead, not follow, in the AI revolution,"" he said.At the summit, discussions were also undertaken on how the Finnish market requires diverse skillsets, from technical to creative problem-solving expertise. For Indian students and professionals, the subtext was clear - Finland wants talent, and it wants it now.But the opportunities are not limited to those looking for jobs alone. For those interested in startups, Finland's ecosystem provides a fertile ground, characterised by a dynamic startup culture and high levels of innovation in AI research, doctoral roles, and advanced computing facilities like LUMI supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers located in Kajaani.For students too, Finland's latest push in R&D means availability of globally recognised AI courses that are closely linked with industry projects.
