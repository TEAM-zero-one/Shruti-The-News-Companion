"Fresh H-1B row as Walmart slashes 1500 tech jobs, Indian-origin CTO Suresh Kumar blamed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fresh-h-1b-row-as-walmart-slashes-1500-tech-jobs-indian-origin-suresh-kumar-blamed/articleshow/121369413.cms,"US tech workers claim Walmart is firing 1500 people to accommodate fresh H-1B hirings.

Poll Do you believe the layoffs at Walmart are linked to the H-1B visa program? Yes, definitely No, not at all









Walmart's standoff with Trump



Is Walmart firing linked with H-1B?







The H-1B row and India hatred on social media got fresh fuel after Walmart announced that it is set to lay off approximately 1,500 employees. The affected departments will be Walmart's technology unit, e-commerce fulfilment center and the advertising segment named Walmart Connect.US tech workers fuming over H-1B programs linked the firing with the H-1B and said it was strategically done to hire foreign nationals in those posts. ""Oh, guess what? The large layoffs today at Walmart are from its technology team. You know, the kind of US worker who's replaced by H1B,"" one wrote. Another user questioned, ""1500. Wow, that's a bloodbath. How many H-1Bs are they bringing in next year?""Some social media users suggested the move came a few weeks after Walmart was granted 3800 H-1B visas, though there is no evidence for the claim.One viral post shared the photo of Suresh Kumar, the Global Chief Technology Officer of Walmart and said that it's no coincidence that over 40 per cent of Walmart's IT department is H-1B hiring from India.A debate started whether Indians were also laid off as one Indian took to LinkedIn claiming that she had been impacted in the recent Walmart Global Tech restructuring. Social media users claimed that there must be a few Indians among the 1500 losing their jobs.The job cuts at Walmart come at a time when the retail major is locked in a battle with Trump over tariffs. Trump accused Walmart of taking advantage of customers and rebuked the for passing on the tariff to shoppers. ""Eat the tariff,"" Trump told Walmart asking them to absorb the impact of the tariffs.Walmart employs 1.6 million people in the country and more than 2.1 million globally. According to experts, H-1B could be one of the factors but AI is another. Walmart said it is cutting jobs in a bid to reduce expenses and streamline decision making. H-1B allows companies to hire foreign nationals for some skilled roles but they get less wages.","Us tech workers claim walmart is firing 1500 people to accommodate fresh h-1b hirings.

Trump threatens Apple with a 25% tariff if it doesn’t build iPhones in America

US President Donald Trump said on Friday (local time) Apple is free to build factories in India, but warned that if it does so, the company will face tariffs when selling its products in the United States.Trump made these comments on Friday while signing executive orders related to nuclear energy in the White House's Oval Office. He referred to a conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook. ""...But I had an understanding with Tim (Cook) that he wouldn't be doing this. He said he's going to India to build plants. I said, 'That's okay to go to India, but you're not going to sell into here without tariffs.' And that's the way it is,"" Trump said.He added, ""We're talking about the iPhone. If they're going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States.""Trump threatened not only Apple but also other smartphone manufacturers with a 25 per cent tariff unless their devices are built in the United States.Trump initially said the tariff would apply only to Apple -- an unusual move to single out a specific company in trade policy. However, he later expanded the threat to include all smartphone makers.""It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn't be fair,"" Trump told reporters in Washington, adding that the new tariffs would take effect by the ""end of June.""Earlier the same day, Trump posted on social media about the issue, saying iPhones sold in the US should be made domestically. He also warned of a 25 per cent tariff if Apple does not follow this.""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he said in the post.This is not the first time Trump has spoken about Apple’s production plans. During his recent trip to Doha, he said he had asked the Apple CEO not to expand manufacturing in India and to focus instead on building in the US.""We have Apple, as you know, that's coming in, and I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,"" Trump said in Doha while addressing business leaders.""I said to him, 'Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You're coming here with USD 500 billion but now I hear you building all over India. I don't want you building in India. You can build in India if you want to take care of India because India is the highest, one of the highest tariff nations in the world. It's very hard to sell into India. And they've (India) offered us a deal where, basically they're willing to literally charge us no tariff,'"" he said.Meanwhile, earlier in May, Cook had said during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call that existing tariffs are determined by the country where the product is made.","Us president donald trump said apple is free to build factories in india, but warned that if it does so, the company will face tariffs when selling its products in the united states.

A second chance at ownership that was never offered the first time

What owning her full catalog could mean for Taylor Swift's empire

In a surprising twist in one of music’s most infamous feuds, Taylor Swift may be on the verge of reclaiming the master recordings that defined the first decade of her career. According to a new report from Page Six, Scooter Braun—the very figure she accused of ""stripping"" her of her life's work—is now reportedly facilitating a potential deal to return the rights to Swift.Back in 2019, Taylor Swift ignited a cultural firestorm when she revealed that she was blindsided by the sale of her original masters to Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings. Despite her repeated attempts to buy them herself, she claimed she was never given the opportunity. “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” Swift wrote in a viral Tumblr post. “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it. ”Braun later sold those masters to Shamrock Capital for $300 million. Now, just six years later, the estimated value of those recordings has ballooned to somewhere between $600 million and $1 billion. And this time, the decision to bring Swift into the conversation may finally be in motion. “The team at Shamrock want to make sure that Taylor has knowledge that they are trying to put this deal to her, as they are not sure that she was ever offered them the first time around,” a source told Page Six.With a current net worth estimated at $1.6 billion, Swift could realistically afford to repurchase her original masters outright. Doing so would make her the sole owner of both her re-recordings—branded “Taylor’s Version”—and the original versions of albums like Fearless, Red, 1989, and Reputation.This unprecedented control would give Swift a rare dual-stream revenue model, allowing her to license both sets of recordings for publishing, commercials, film, and streaming—further solidifying her as one of the most powerful artists in music history.While fans love seeing her support her NFL boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who recently gushed, “I just listen to Taylor’s music… she has something for everything,” Swift is clearly focused on something far more permanent: protecting and preserving her legacy.Also Read: “Thankfully, I don't have to deal with that”: Kirk Cousins takes a jab at Travis Kelce’s body hair and Taylor Swift’s tolerance of it Should the deal go through, it would mark a full-circle moment in a saga that reshaped the industry—and a powerful victory for artists’ rights everywhere.","Taylor swift may be on the verge of reclaiming her master recordings.

iPhone's US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company. By this fall, Ives believes Apple ""could manufacture 60% to 65% of its smartphones in India,"" citing his ""high level of confidence"" that the iPhone maker is accelerating its manufacturing transfer to the South Asian country.The prediction comes amid escalating tensions between Apple and the Trump administration over the company's India operations. During a business event in Qatar, Trump revealed he confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him... I don't want you building in India.""Despite presidential pressure, Ives suggests Apple retains strategic options. The company ""could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy,"" he noted, with actions dependent ""on the tariff situation and deal negotiations.""Apple has reportedly reassured the Indian government there will be ""no change"" in its investment plans, even as Trump publicly urged the company to increase US. production. The tech giant manufactured approximately $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, representing a 60% increase from the previous year.However, Ives dismisses the possibility of significant American iPhone production, stating there is ""no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US. in the near term."" The analyst warns that US.-manufactured iPhones would cost consumers around $3,500 due to supply chain complexities and manufacturing costs.Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn continues expanding its Indian operations with a $1.5 billion investment, planning to produce 25-30 million iPhones at its India plants in 2025, more than doubling last year's output.","Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iphones in india by fall 2025, an analyst predicts.

The Indian-American engineer Vaniya Agrawal who disrupted Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations in April this year again created disorder at another high-profile Microsoft event. In the latest incident, she disrupted Microsoft's ongoing developer event, Build 2025. Microsoft Build is the company’s annual developers conference. Vaniya Agrawal, along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr, shouted at Microsoft’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.Haiby was co-hosting a Build session on best security practices for AI, alongside Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s head of responsible AI, when these two former Microsoft employees disrupted the talk to protest against the company’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government. This is the third day in a row that the Microsoft Build 2025 conference has been disrupted by Pro-Palestine protests.On Monday (May 19), shortly after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stage for his keynote address at the Build 2025 conference, an employee interrupted the speech. The employee started shouting “Free Palestine” and demanded accountability from the CEO for the company’s work with the Israeli government.Next day, on May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh's keynote presentation, marking the second consecutive day of pro-Palestine protests at the event. ""Jay! My people are suffering!"" the protester shouted at Parikh, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of CoreAI, during his presentation on Azure AI technology. ""Cut ties! No Azure for apartheid! Free, free Palestine!"" Security personnel quickly escorted the demonstrator from the venue as he continued calling for Microsoft to end its contracts with the Israeli government.Earlier this year, Agrawal disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security.Microsoft has reportedly Blocked emails with certain words. According to a report in The Verge, ""Microsoft employees have discovered that any emails they send with the terms “Palestine” or “Gaza” are getting temporarily blocked from being sent to recipients inside and outside the company.""A software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, Vaniya Agrawal publicly shared her resignation email last month. She sent the email to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and thousands of Microsoft employees following her protest at the company's 50th anniversary celebration on April 4. In the company-wide email, she wrote that she has been working with the company for over one-and-a-half years.Agrawal was fired shortly after the event. She was asked to go with immediate effect, without completing her two-week notice. The other protester, Ibtihal Aboussad, too was terminated for ""acts of misconduct"" following similar disruptions at the Microsoft Anniversary event.Vaniya Agrawal has been constantly sharing photos of protests around Microsoft Build 2025 venues.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey! Anyway I could get you in a video? 👀” he said in a post on X.","Jimmy donaldson, also known as mrbeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with celebrity net worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19.

This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel.

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs 2025: over 61,000 jobs cut as microsoft, google, amazon, and crowdstrike reshape workforce.

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.In a related news, Musk shared a 15-second clip of the US Vice President in conversation with Joe Rogan, where Vance said “You can say a lot of things about Elon Musk, but you can't say he's a dumb**s”. The two burst into laughter, as Rogan quipped, “You get dunked on by one of the smartest guys alive.”Musk shared the clip on his X timeline, responding with, ""Lmao,"" short for (Laughing My A** Off).",Tesla ceo elon musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the us federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

Scott Galloway, a leading US marketing academic, criticised Elon Musk 's implementation of severe government cutbacks in Trump's administration and described it as “one of the greatest brand destructions” ever.During the Friday edition of his co-hosted Pivot podcast, Galloway explained that Musk had distanced Tesla's core electric vehicle customers while building ties with Trump supporters, who typically show little interest in electric vehicles He referenced data showing Tesla's reputation plummeting from eighth position in 2021 to 95th place, Guardian reported.“He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway remarked. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.”Galloway highlighted Tesla's declining sales across Europe: France (-59%), Sweden (-81%), Netherlands (-74%), Denmark (-66%), Switzerland (-50%) and Portugal (-33%).Musk's recent involvement in European politics, including commentary on Germany's federal election and UK grooming gang discussions on X, his social media platform, has affected Tesla's European market position.BYD, Tesla's Chinese rival, achieved higher European sales in April, according to Jato Dynamics' industry analysis.“This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway said to his co-host, veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. “Tesla was a great brand.“He’s alienated his core demographic.”Musk's role leading the department of government efficiency (Doge) under Trump's second presidency began in January, following his super PAC's $200m campaign contribution in November.Polls indicate public dissatisfaction with Musk's government role, particularly regarding federal employee treatment through Doge's job reductions.By April's end, Tesla reported 71% lower profits.
