Isro develops world’s largest vertical propellant mixer for rocket sold propellants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-develops-worlds-largest-vertical-propellant-mixer-for-rocket-sold-propellants/articleshow/118370967.cms,"NEW DELHI: In its quest for self-reliance within the space sector, Isro has announced the successful development of a 10-tonne ‘vertical planetary mixer’, the largest of its kind for solid propellants globally. This innovative equipment has been designed and manufactured in collaboration with the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) in Bengaluru.Solid propulsion plays a crucial role in Indian space transportation systems and vertical mixer is one of the critical equipment in production of a solid motor of a rocket. “Solid propellants are the backbone of rocket motors, and their production requires precise mixing of highly sensitive and hazardous ingredients,” Isro said, adding “the 10-tonne vertical mixer is the world’s largest solid propellant mixing equipment”.The formal handover of the 10-tonne mixer took place on Feb 13 at CMTI, Bengaluru, where the director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, received the mixer from the CMTI director in the presence of Isro chairman V Narayanan. The new system is expected to play a crucial role in advancing India’s spaceflight capabilities.“Department of Space has undertaken multiple initiatives towards indigenous development of critical technologies, materials and machinery as part of ‘atma-nirbharata (self reliance)’ in space. Realisation of indigenous 10-tonne vertical mixer is a true testament to India’s growing technological prowess, self-reliance and unwavering commitment to innovation,” the space agency said.Solid rocket motors require precise mixing of sensitive and hazardous ingredients. The new vertical mixer will improve the efficiency and safety of this process. The mixer weighs about 150 tonnes with a length of 5.4 m, breadth of 3.3 m & height of 8.7 m. The development involves collaboration with academia and industries and has successfully completed factory-level acceptance tests.Isro said the mixer will significantly improve productivity, quality and throughput in heavy solid motor production.",Isro has announced the successful development of a 10-tonne ‘vertical planetary mixer’ it is the largest of its kind for solid propellants globally.

"India's first microbiological nanosat, developed by students, to find ways to keep astronauts healthy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-first-microbiological-nanosat-developed-by-students-to-find-ways-to-keep-astronauts-healthy/articleshow/118370934.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's first microbiological nanosatellite RVSAT-1, which was launched on board Isro’s PSLV C-60 last December as part of the SPADEX/POEM-4 mission, has been designed and developed by a team of students of Bengaluru-based RV College of Engineering in order to explore the growth of the gut bacterium in space.For the students’ group Team Antariksh, RVSAT-1 is more than a student project: “It is a leap into the future of space exploration”. Success at each stage of tests of the nanosatellite bolstered the team’s confidence and brought the team closer to their dream of sending their work into space. And it was finally realised when RVSAT-1 was launched into space on Dec 30 last year from Sriharikota.Gut bacteria plays an important role in our health by helping control digestion and benefiting our immune system and many other aspects of health. To know how the gut bacteria functions in space will help Isro find ways to keep Indian astronauts healthy during space missions.H Nandish, a third-year aerospace student of the college who is engaged in RVSAT-1 project, told TOI, “Our satellite mission was only for three days. We collected a lot of data soon after the launch. The study was to measure the growth of gut bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, in space and how it behaved in zero gravity. Study of data will not only help in space medicine but will also provide clues for applications on Earth, such as advanced waste recycling systems and combating antibiotic resistance. Data will also help Isro find solutions to keep astronauts healthy for a long space journey.”“We will publish a research paper after finding results from our nanosatellite data and put the report in public domain for its use by Isro, academia and others,” Nandish said, adding “data will basically help in astronaut health, waste management and antibiotic development.”On growth of gut bacteria, Aditi Arun, project manager, who is also engaged in the satellite project, said, “The bacterial growth curve is plotted utilising optical density measurement. This gives a quantitative measure of the variation of growth patterns in space.”The journey of RVSAT-1 has been challenging. Miniaturising complex lab equipment like incubators and spectrophotometers into a 2-U nanosatellite was a daunting challenge for Team Antariksh. Its innovative design incorporated a state-of-the-art microfluidic set-up and a precise optical system.The payload's unique experiment, combining bacterial growth analysis with prebiotic supplementation, promises groundbreaking insights into maintaining astronaut gut health. RVSAT-1's development faced moments of uncertainty. The rigorous testing phase demanded the highest standards of precision and performance. Each test-thermal vacuum (T-VAC), vibration, 1,500g shock test, and electromagnetic interference and compatibility — simulated the harsh conditions of space, pushing the payload to its limits.Beyond the technical achievements, RVSAT-1 symbolises the power of collaboration and the boundless possibilities of student innovation.","India's first microbiological nanosatellite rvsat-1 was launched on board isro’s pslv c-60 last december.

These include most central ministries, their departments and several private establishments.The chief commissioner of persons with disabilities (CCPD) proposes to impose higher penalties on the establishments that fail the compliance review to be held after Feb 28. The establishments have been asked to deposit the penalty amount in the National fund for Persons with Disabilities.CCPD had sought access audit reports as stipulated by law from all ministries and wanted to know if 'access auditors' had been appointed. The letter sent out by the court shows that only 20 establishments appointed an access auditor for verifying if the websites and apps comply with accessibility standards that aim to enable blind, deaf and deaf-blind persons to access the online mode. Only six establishments have been able to submit access audit reports.

"Chandrayaan-4 will have 5 modules, need multiple dockings; work on Lupex Marches on",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chandrayaan-4-will-have-5-modules-need-multiple-dockings-work-on-lupex-marches-on/articleshow/118367218.cms,"Status & mission sequence



Lupex marches on

BENGALURU: Chandrayaan-4 India’s planned lunar sample return mission that aims to soft land near the Moon’s south pole, collect samples from the lunar surface, and return them to Earth for analysis will have a mass of approximately 9,200kg compared to Chandrayaan-3’s 3,900kg.Since Isro ’s current capability to lift payloads to geotransfer orbit (GTO) is limited to about 4,500 kg, the mission will require two separate launches: Two modules will be launched in one stack, three modules will be launched in another stack. These launches will be conducted using the LVM-3 vehicle with a one-month gap between them.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Isro chairman V Narayanan explained how multiple dockings will be carried out, and also gave details on Chandrayaan-5 , the joint mission with Japan, also called Lupex (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission).“We have completed the configuration design and now the design of various subsystems is ongoing,” Narayanan said, adding that the mission architecture involves multiple docking and undocking manoeuvres in both Earth and lunar orbits.According to Narayanan, after the two launches, the initial docking of modules will occur in Earth orbit. A propulsion module will then transport the spacecraft to lunar orbit (separating at around 1-lakh-km from Moon). In the lunar orbit, four modules will remain after propulsion module separation and two modules, including the ascending module will separate and land on Moon.After sample collection, one module will return and dock with the remaining modules in lunar orbit, the sample will be transferred to a re-entry module and the re-entry module will return to Earth with the samples.“The mission requires development of new technologies, including a high-capacity propulsion system, specialised payloads, and robotic arms for sample collection. Work on all of this is going on,” Narayanan said.Elaborating on Lupex, which India will designate as Chandrayaan-5, Narayanan said the landing mass of the spacecraft will be 6,200kg and the rover on Lupex will weigh 350-400kg compared to Chandrayaan-3’s 26kg.For Lupex, Japan will be responsible for the development and operation of the launch vehicle and rover, while India will be responsible for the development and operation of the lander. Aside from Indian and Japanese instruments, Lupex will also carry American, and European instruments.“After the project was approved, configuration study has been completed, and teams are now working on hardware design and development,” Narayanan said. TOI had reported earlier that Lupex will need Isro to work on a heavier lander engine, which Narayanan confirmed. He said work had already begun on that.In the first week of Feb, Jaxa, Japan’s space agency updated its mission page on Lupex to add details about the rover payloads. As per Jaxa, the rover will carry seven main payloads.The first payload, Resource Investigating Water Analyser (REIWA) will have the Lunar Thermogravimetric Analyser (LTGA), Triple-reflection Reflectron (Triton), Aquatic Detector using Optical Resonance (ADORE) and Isro Sample Analysis Package (Isap).The other six payloads are: Advanced Lunar Imaging Spectrometer (Alis), Neutron Spectrometer (NS), Exospheric Mass Spectrometer for Lupex (EMS-L), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Mid-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (MIR) and Permittivity and Thermophysical Investigation for Moon's Aquatic Scout (Prathima).","Chandrayaan-4 india’s planned lunar sample return mission will have a mass of approximately 9,200kg.

EE warns users about rising scam risks on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ee-warns-users-about-rising-scam-risks-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118272199.cms,"Representative image

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

Vietnam's strict new social media regulations strangle free speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/vietnams-strict-new-social-media-regulations-strangle-free-speech/articleshow/118357094.cms,"Representative image

BANGKOK: New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them, according to an analysis released Tuesday.Vietnam's authorities implemented ""decree 147"" in December, tightening regulations on social media companies like Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok in a bid to further stifle criticism, said Ben Swanton, one of the authors of the report by The 88 Project, a group focused on human rights and free speech issues in Vietnam.""Any challenge to the government and the Communist Party, any significant challenge to their official narrative of events, is perceived by them as a situation that is getting out of control,"" he said in an interview from Thailand.Among other things, the decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national ID cards that must be provided to the government upon request, and for the social media companies to store their data in Vietnam.It also prevents social media users from engaging in citizen journalism or posting information about suspected government wrongdoing, and requires companies to remove posts deemed illegal within 24 hours. The decree requires companies to allow authorities access to their internal search engines so that it can identify offending content.Social media companies have until late March to be in compliance, and it is not yet clear whether they will try to push back. TikTok and Facebook refused to comment on their plans, while X and Google, which owns YouTube, did not return emails.Already, however, researchers have noticed a decline in political posts, Swanton said.""In the last several years Hanoi has imprisoned or forced into exile the country's most prominent independent journalists, reformers, human rights activists, and dissidents. This has had a chilling effect that encourages people to engage in self-censorship,"" he said. ""Decree 147 is designed to turn this chilling effect into an icy stranglehold on free speech.""Vietnamese authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the Project 88 analysis or the intent behind the new decree.Authorities tighten the screws on critical reportingAbout 65 million Vietnamese have Facebook accounts, roughly two-thirds of the population, and some 35 million have YouTube accounts. About half of Vietnam's people say they get most of their news from social media.Already, the government frequently insists critical posts from outside the country be geo-blocked so they cannot be accessed inside Vietnam and it has moved quickly to censor posts it deems unacceptable, like a video of a top minister eating a gold-encrusted steak in London in 2021 while Vietnam was on Covid-19 lockdown.In October, a prominent Vietnamese blogger was sentenced to 12 years in prison for articles and videos exposing the corruption of government officials, and in January, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts criticising the country's former top judge.Project 88 researchers said the new decree will also give authorities better tools to go after those who just read or watch social media posts as well.They noted a case last June in which police in one province went through the profiles of 13,328 members of a Facebook group that had information deemed ""hostile to the state"" and identified 20 people in their province, went to their homes and demanded they leave the group.""If implemented as intended, decree 147 would likely make it less time consuming to identify members of groups like this and ensure that groups with anti-state content will be blocked in the country,"" the report said.It urges social media companies and others affected to refuse to comply with provisions of the decree that violate free expression rights, and for the United States and United Nations to pressure Vietnam to repeal the measure.","Vietnam's authorities implemented ""decree 147"" in december, tightening regulations on social media companies.

Lenskart IPO plans

Lenskart IPO : Lenskart aims to double its valuation to $10 billion for its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO), as indicated by informed sources. The eyewear company plans to submit its draft documentation in May.Numerous startups spanning ecommerce, B2B and fintech sectors are preparing for public listings this year. Firms like Zepto, Groww, Bluestone, PharmEasy, Oyo, Ather Energy and Zetwerk are at various phases of their IPO groundwork.Despite optimistic outlook from banking professionals, these organisations will align their offering prices with prevailing market dynamics during listing, particularly those yet to achieve profitability, following last year's pattern.Recent discussions between Lenskart CEO Peyush Bansal and principal investors with IPO bankers have focused on the valuation for the $1-billion public offering. However, the final execution depends on market conditions at the time of launch.""Work is underway to file the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) by May so it can… get listed this calendar year,"" a source told ET. ""Internally, some feel even more aggressive about the valuation, but that may not be in sync with current market conditions and one has to leave money on the table for incoming IPO investors.""""The firm, along with stakeholders, is now ready to go public,"" another source indicated to the financial daily, noting limited time remains for a pre-listing round. ""That's the big change in stance now on the IPO.""While investors had previously discussed public market opportunities over the past year due to Lenskart's growth and profitability, Bansal had not confirmed these plans. Instead, significant secondary transactions during the previous two years allowed investors to partially sell their holdings.Also Read | Will banks be open on March 31, 2025? Here’s what the latest RBI direction says Last June, Lenskart completed a $200-million secondary round at a $5-billion valuation, following an earlier primary capital injection at $4.5 billion. Despite secondaries typically trading at lower values, Lenskart shares have remained attractive to both new and existing investors.SoftBank and Temasek-backed Lenskart dominates the eyewear sector, with profitable operations in India and anticipated expansion in Thailand. The company's premium segment includes Owndays, a Japanese brand acquired for $400 million in 2022, according to an informed source.The company, established 15 years ago and recipient of ET Startup Awards, has achieved an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion (Rs 8,400 crore). Their production capacity stands at 25 million frames and 30-40 million lenses yearly.The firm holds a substantial ownership in the French omnichannel eyewear brand Le Petit Lunetier.Also Read| New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: 8 salary perks to save around Rs 1.35 lakh income tax under old regime Lenskart's total funding, including secondary transactions where existing investors sold shares to new investors, amounts to nearly $2 billion since its establishment.In preparation for its IPO, Lenskart has focused on achieving complete profitability, successfully reducing losses while maintaining steady revenue growth.The company's net loss decreased to Rs 10 crore in FY24 from Rs 64 crore in FY23, attributed to technology-enhanced operational efficiencies. A professional associated with Bansal noted, ""They (Lenskart) rely and leverage a lot from technology, which leads to operational efficiency in an omnichannel model.""The operating revenue increased by 43% year-on-year to Rs 5,428 crore in FY24.

NEW DELHI: Tesla has chosen locations for two showrooms in New Delhi and Mumbai, marking a step toward its plan to enter the world's third-largest auto market, according to news agency Reuters, citing sources.This decision comes a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Billionaire Elon Musk in the United States, where they discussed space, mobility, and technology.The American automotive giant Tesla has been scouting for showroom locations in India since late last year to kickstart sales in the auto market, after previously halting its market entry plans in 2022.Tesla has now secured a lease for showroom space in the Aerocity area near New Delhi's international airport, a prime hub featuring hotels, retail outlets, and global corporate offices.In Mumbai, the company has chosen a location in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), a major business and retail district near the city's airport.Both showrooms are expected to span approximately 5,000 square feet, though opening dates have not yet been finalised.The company's strategy involves ""to sell imported EVs in India ... these deals are for showrooms, not service centres,"" a source told Reuters, who also confirmed that Tesla will manage these facilities directly.The Electric car maker has also posted job listings for 13 mid-level positions in India this week, including roles such as business operations analyst and customer support specialist, signaling a potential market entry.According to the company's official website, the vacancies are specifically for the 'Mumbai Suburban' region.The available positions encompass service advisor, parts advisor, service technician, service manager, sales & customer support, store manager, business operations analyst, customer support supervisor, customer support specialist, delivery operations specialist, order operations specialist, inside sales advisor, and consumer engagement manager.Despite intermittent discussions between Tesla and India over the years, the automaker had remained hesitant due to high import duties. Recently, India reduced its basic customs duty on premium vehicles priced above $40,000 from 110% to 70%, according to a Bloomberg report.President Donald Trump last week highlighted India's high vehicle duties but agreed with PM Modi to pursue an expedited trade agreement and address their tariff disagreements.Although India's electric vehicle sector remains small compared to China's, it presents an opportunity for Tesla amidst declining sales, marking its first yearly decrease in EV deliveries in more than ten years. India recorded nearly 100,000 electric car sales last year, while China achieved 11 million.",Tesla has chosen locations for two showrooms in new delhi and mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Canva - one of the world's top graphic design software companies and a key competitor to Adobe - saw as many as 5.3 lakh presentations being made daily in India just in 2024. The usage was equally big when it came to making resumes, social media posts, or even pitch decks.Cameron Adams, co-founder and chief product officer of Canva, says India will be a critical factor as the Australian company - last valued at around $32 billion - looks to move towards its goal of hitting one billion global users . ""India will play a critical role in us getting to a billion users,"" Adams told TOI in an interview. Excerpts:We started in 2012 in Sydney and released our first product the next year, with an idea of empowering the world to design. We realised that design was a superpower that you could give to people that enabled them to do things they couldn't dream of before. It started off slowly and took us a while to build momentum. It grew and grew and grew and we signed up a million people in the first 18 months, and now are at 220 million users that use our product across the world.India is one of our most critical markets. It's recently gone from being our fifth most popular market to being the fourth most popular. It's rising up through the ranks and even growing faster than a lot of the world. That's why we've been keen to invest in India over the last few years. The investment that we put into the team and products here pays dividends.It doesn't particularly concern me about India because this is a pattern that we're seeing around the world. You're increasingly seeing countries and regions like Europe bringing in their own data protection laws and requiring data sovereignty. So, creating the systems where we can do that globally is actually a focus of one of our teams. I don't think it's a problem in India, specifically because once we've got the right infrastructure that we can spin up, we can do that fairly easily across regions.We're definitely looking at the infrastructure mechanisms by how we do that, like how we structure our code, how we have our service set up, how we replicate data across regions, etc. Our engineering teams are looking into it... I can't say specifically about India right now, but we're definitely looking at systems that enable that in different regions around.","Cameron adams, co-founder and chief product officer of canva, says india will be a critical factor as the australian company looks to move towards its goal of hitting one billion global users.

Tatas to inject Rs 500 crore in Mumbai's Breach Candy hospital to boost infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tatas-to-inject-rs-500-crore-in-mumbais-breach-candy-hospital-to-boost-infrastructure/articleshow/118367471.cms,"MUMBAI: Tata Group , India's largest conglomerate, is set to expand its presence in healthcare through a Rs 500-crore contribution to Breach Candy Hospital , a move that will bring the elite 275-bed multi-speciality SoBo hospital within its ambit of influence.The funding will position the $165-bn Tata Group as the hospital's largest financial backer, enabling it to add three representatives to the present 14-member board of trustees. Group chairman N Chandrasekaran will replace veteran banker Deepak Parekh as chairman of Breach Candy Hospital Trust from Oct 1, 2025. The hospital will retain its name, though the Tata brand will be incorporated in some form, with one possibility being ""Breach Candy, a Tata Sons associate"". The funding is expected to support infrastructure and technological improvements at the facility that has traditionally been favoured by the rich and famous, more so by those with 'old money'.Breach Candy managing trustee Uday Kilachand said the ""deep connection"" that Ratan Tata had with the facility has ""now evolved"" and the Tatas have ""formalised"" the association. This is Tata Group's third healthcare project in Mumbai after Tata Memorial Centre in Parel for cancer research and treatment and an animal hospital set up in Mahalaxmi last year.Breach Candy, which introduced India's first MRI facility in 1998, was established in 1946 by European Hospital Trust with financial support from European companies operating in pre-Independence India, such as Unilever, Forbes & Crompton Greaves.These companies have maintained ties with the hospital through their representatives who are on the board.Designed by British architect Claude Batley as a 25-bed nursing home, its ownership transitioned to Breach Candy Hospital Trust, registered under Indian Trusts Act and Section 8 of the Companies Act.Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee was here for his knee surgery. Actor Amitabh Bachchan's admission in July 1982 followed injuries sustained during the filming of Coolie. The facility also witnessed the passing of Reliance Group founder Dhirubhai Ambani in July 2002, 13 days after he suffered a stroke. In Oct 2024, former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away at the hospital due to age-related ailments.""Ratan Tata maintained a deep connection with Breach Candy hospital, both as an admirer and benefactor. He relied on the hospital's doctors and nursing staff for his personal healthcare needs. Through Tata Trusts, he provided financial assistance to the hospital for establishing facilities and acquiring medical equipment, albeit on an informal basis. However, the relationship has now evolved as Tata Sons has formalised its association with the hospital through an official understanding,"" said Kilachand.Parekh will continue as trustee even after Chandrasekaran takes over. Other notable trustees include Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra; Jamshyd Godrej of Godrej & Boyce; Rajashree Birla, mother of Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Birla; M Pallonji Group director and Tata Trusts trustee Mehli Mistry; Pallon Mistry of Shapoorji Pallonji Group; Hindustan Unilever CEO Rohit Jawa; and former TCS CEO S Ramadorai. Ramadorai and Mehli, who serve as independent board members, will not be counted among Tata Group's representatives.Breach Candy CEO Anirudh Kohli outlined that the funding by Tatas would be used to enhance the hospital's infrastructure, including state-of-the-art equipment and technology. The hospital presently comprises three buildings; plans include to construct an additional tower.Tata Group's investment coincides with Adani Group's plans to construct a 1,000-bed hospital and medical college in Kandivli, marking its entry into Mumbai's healthcare sector. It also places Tata alongside other conglomerates like Reliance, Hinduja, Birla, and Raheja in Mumbai's healthcare industry.","Tata group is set to expand its presence in healthcare through a rs 500-crore contribution to breach candy hospital.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds. Racetrack officials, however, said the times were not comparable because the Chinese car was a preliminary version competing in an essentially open category, while the Taycan was a showroom-ready model and ran in a highly regulated category. Regardless, the message was unmistakable. nyt","German automakers that for decades commanded china's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle.
