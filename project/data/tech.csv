"Ethanol Blended Petrol: 20% ethanol blended petrol, SC dismisses PIL against nationwide rollout; Centre defends move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/20-ethanol-blended-petrol-sc-dismisses-pil-against-nationwide-rollout-centre-defends-move/articleshow/123630628.cms,"E27 Fuel Explained: What 27% Ethanol In Petrol Means For Your Car, Mileage & Wallet

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the nationwide introduction of 20 per cent ethanol blended petrol (E20).The plea, filed by advocate Akshay Malhotra, sought directions to the ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to make ethanol-free petrol available at fuel stations. It also urged mandatory labelling of ethanol content on pumps and dispensing units, along with information on ethanol compatibility of vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing.The petition argued that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023, and some BS-VI models, were not designed for high ethanol blends. It claimed that motorists were left with no choice but to buy fuel that could harm their vehicles. ""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing,"" the plea said.According to the PIL, the 20 per cent blend was causing mechanical degradation, loss of fuel efficiency, engine corrosion, and higher repair costs. It also alleged that insurance companies were rejecting claims linked to ethanol-related damage.The petition highlighted global practices, stating that in the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol is still widely available and pumps display ethanol content clearly, giving consumers an informed choice. In contrast, India provides only ethanol-blended fuel without disclosure of composition at the pump, it added.","The plea sought directions to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to make ethanol-free petrol available at fuel stations.

Tom Brady’s newsletter sparked tension with Bündchen

Gisele Bündchen focused on peace and a new chapter with Joaquim Valente



Back in August, headlines swirled once again around Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen — not for their divorce settlement, but because of a newsletter penned by the NFL legend. The retired quarterback, who often used his personal platform to share insights on parenting and discipline, appeared to strike a nerve with his ex-wife. His words, meant to frame himself as a hands-on father, reportedly deepened the rift in their already fragile post-divorce relationship.In his 199th edition, Brady wrote about “being a great father” and insisted that “reading bedtime stories and helping them with homework are not the only ways to be a great parent.” While the remark seemed general, insiders claimed Bündchen interpreted it as a pointed dig. According to one source, the supermodel felt frustrated with the ongoing “narrative that he sacrificed everything for them,” adding bluntly, “he didn’t. She did.”The fallout reportedly shifted their co-parenting dynamic. A separate insider told Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop that there was no “real relationship” left between the two. Their interaction, the source added, had become “strictly logistics” — limited to “drop-offs, pick-ups, school events” for their children, Benjamin and Vivian.While Brady’s comments stirred controversy, Bündchen appeared to be moving forward.By then, she had already welcomed a child with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, in May 2025. The couple’s growing family fueled speculation about wedding plans, with Bündchen sharing glimpses of their happiness on social media, including a tender Mother’s Day post introducing their baby.Also Read: Post-Tom Brady glow?

Why Nestlé sacked its CEO



Who is Philipp Navratil, the new Nestlé CEO?









Swiss food giant Nestlé on Monday sacked its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, with immediate effect after an investigation found he had an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate”, in breach of the company’s code of business conduct.Freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to CEO in September 2024 after leading its Latin America division.Freixe’s exit places him among a growing list of high-profile business leaders forced out over workplace relationships. As per AFP, similar departures include BP’s Bernard Looney in 2023 and McDonald’s Steve Easterbrook in 2019, who were both removed for failing to disclose relationships with colleagues.The company announced that Nespresso chief Philipp Navratil will take over the role.According to news agency AFP, Nestlé’s board launched an inquiry overseen by chairman Paul Bulcke and lead independent director Pablo Isla, supported by external counsel.“The departure of Laurent Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate which breached Nestlé's code of business conduct,” the board said in a statement.Bulcke called the decision “necessary”, adding, “Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service.”As per The Guardian, Freixe replaced Mark Schneider last year in a surprise switch, tasked with reviving sluggish consumer demand. Nestlé has faced challenges, including falling profits and weak spending in China, while also passing on higher raw material costs to shoppers.The company’s shares dropped nearly a quarter in 2024 but closed slightly higher on Monday at 75.49 Swiss francs.Navratil, who began his career with Nestlé in 2001, rose through senior roles in Central America and Mexico before leading the Nescafé and Starbucks brands globally. He became Nespresso CEO in 2024 and joined the executive board in January 2025.According to Axios, the board praised him for “achieving results in challenging environments” and said he would “accelerate efficiency efforts” without altering Nestlé’s current strategy.","Laurent freixe, who joined the firm in 1986, had only been promoted to ceo in september 2024 after leading its latin america division.

Millionaire CEO Piotr Szczerek was unmasked on social media after his video of snatching a hat from a child at US Open went viral. The hat was special as it was signed by tennis star Kamil Majchrzak's and the CEO had no reason to snatch it from the child other than the pure intent of bullying a child.

The moment instantly went viral and sparked widespread outrage. Online sleuths identified Szczerek as the man in the clip, and backlash followed rapidly. Following the incident, Szczerek deactivated his social media accounts amid the public fury. Critics even debated his actions online, calling him “selfish” and demanding accountability.

Taco Bell CTO admits AI cannot work everywhere; says company now reconsidering where and where not to use the AI going forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taco-bell-cto-admits-ai-cannot-work-everywhere-says-company-now-reconsidering-where-and-where-not-to-use-the-ai-going-forward/articleshow/123605121.cms,"Representative Image

What Taco Bell CTO said about using AI in the company’s operations



“Like many people, sometimes it falls short, but other times it really impresses me,”

“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,”

“I can tell you it’s a very active conversation inside Taco Bell in partnership with our franchisees. I think at the end of the day, it’s really, really early. And we feel that. And I think other brands feel that, too,”

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering. This decision from the American fast food chain came after its new voice AI system, which has been installed at over 500 drive-thru locations across the US, received mixed reviews. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews , admitted they are ""learning a lot"" from the experience. The voice AI has been met with social media complaints about glitches, delays, and general customer discomfort. Some users have also been intentionally ""trolling"" the system with unusual orders, such as asking for “18,000 cups of water.”In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mathews described his experience with the technology as inconsistent.he said.He added that he is now considering more carefully when it makes sense to rely on the technology. Using AI at every drive-through may not always be practical, he noted. Matthews also pointed out that in busy locations with long lines, a human staff member could manage the situation more effectively.Mathews added that he plans to work with restaurants to help them navigate the decision.he explained.However, Taco Bell is still refining its plans while reviewing data from over two million customer orders handled by AI.Matthews highlighted.Nearly three years into the generative AI wave, companies are still testing and revising their strategies, unsure of where the technology fits best. However, drive-through voice AI remains a challenge.McDonald’s dropped its IBM trial and is now working with Google Cloud, while Wendy’s is also expanding its FreshAi system built on Google tech. On the other hand, Taco Bell’s parent, Yum Brands, has partnered with Nvidia to explore potential AI applicattions.","Taco bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (ai) for food ordering.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

WhatsApp has said that it uncovered a cyberespionage , or hacking, operation that exploited multiple security vulnerabilities across its platform and Apple devices to conduct targeted surveillance of users, with reportedly civil society activists appearing to be among the primary targets. In a statement issued, the Meta-owned company said that it has plugged the loop holes that hackers used to attack specific users.“Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device,” WhatsApp said in a statement.The Meta-owned messaging service disclosed the security breach in a brief statement, revealing that hackers had discovered and weaponised a chain of vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise both the WhatsApp application and Apple devices in coordinated attacks.“We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users,” the company added, without revealing much about the cyber attack.However, a report by news agency Reuters said that an estimated 200 users worldwide have potentially been compromised during the espionage campaign.Donncha O Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that members of civic organisations appear to be among those affected by the surveillance operation.“WhatsApp has just sent out a round of threat notifications to individuals they believe where targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in past 90 days.

Government spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders,” O Cearbhaill wrote in a post on social media platform X.He noted that the Apple vulnerability was in a core image library, advising people that they should update their devices and enable iOS Lockdown Mode or Android‘s Advanced Protection Mode to help protect against attacks like this.",The whatsapp scam that gives hackers your phone!

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption.

Teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rocket science for Wall Street , leaving SpaceX to join billionaire Ken Griffin 's Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer at just 16 years old. The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Kairan Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.In a Fox Business Network interview, Huang said: ""I don't know that it's 'forced to say yes,' but ultimately, it's in the best interest of the world, of our country, for us to be able to sell in China"" .""So whatever it takes to get it approved for us to be able to sell in China is fine with us,"" he added.",N nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

Kotak Institutional Equities maintained its add rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,555. Analysts said that the company reiterated its earlier target to double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) between FY2022 and FY2027. For organised retail, the company expects 20%+ revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three years while for the FMCG business, it has a five-year ambition of Rs 1 lakh crore revenue. They also said that the company has a long-term ambition of being India's largest FMCG company with a global presence. The company also announced a new JV with Meta and has expanded its partnership with Google cloud.Nomura maintained its buy rating on Ather Energy with a price target of Rs 458. Analysts said that Ather has unveiled EL platform, a new electric scooter platform, and also connected mobility as it continues to strengthen its position as a tech & innovation leader in e2w space. The company is focusing on enhancing the overall rider experience. Analysts are now looking at the success of the next-gen fast-charging rollout and timely commissioning of Ather’s Aurangabad facility.InCred re-initiated its coverage on Delhivery with a reduced rating and a target price of Rs 300.Analysts see headwinds for the company and they feel Ecom Express acquisition may be a damp squib in FY26-27. They also feel Amazon and Flipkart's third-party logistics (3PL) foray to hamper Delhivery. They also pointed out that the company achieved only marginal operating leverage in FY20-25 while its recent performance remains insipid. Analysts feel the upside risks to the stock price lies in higher-than-expected margins.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Torrent Power with the target price at Rs 1,444. Analysts said that the company has a letter of award (LoA) for a 1,600-megawatt thermal power plant in MP. They believe the plant can generate a 15-17% internal rate of return (IRRs), assuming a 70:30 debt-equity ratio. They also estimate capacity charge could be Rs 4.1-4.3/unit. Analysts said Torrent Power’s balance sheet has sufficient headroom for growth.Goldman Sachs has a buy on Uno Minda with the target price at Rs 1,450. Analysts feel the stock price incorporates partial benefit from Uno Minda’s Suzhou Inovance partnership to supply electric car components, starting 1Q27. These components can potentially increase Uno Minda’s car SUV end market kit value from Rs 90,000 per unit presently, to above Rs 2 lakh per unit and should offer operating leverage more visibly in FY28. They said that the company has confirmed one OEM customer for Phase-1 of plant operations, and as more electric car launches flow through over the next 12 months, they see upside optionality.","Kotak institutional equities maintained its add rating on reliance industries with a target price of rs 1,555.

Julia Stewart thought she had done everything right. As president of Applebee’s, she built what she calls a “pretty remarkable” team, doubled the stock price, and put the struggling restaurant chain back on its feet.Confident in her record, she approached the CEO’s office expecting the top job. Instead, she got a blunt “No. Not ever.”That moment, Stewart says, became the turning point of her career.Speaking on the Matthews Mentality Podcast in April 2025, the now–CEO of DineEquity Inc. recalled how the rejection fueled her next big move.“I thought he meant, ‘No, not today,’” Stewart said of the conversation. “But he said, ‘No, not ever.’”The blow was personal. But it didn’t break her. Stewart left Applebee’s and joined IHOP, where she spent five years reviving the brand’s image and performance.Then came the full-circle moment.Stewart led IHOP’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Applebee’s, bringing the chain that once rejected her under her control. “Now, obviously, ultimately, you don’t borrow $2.3 billion for revenge. You just don’t do that. But we did borrow $2.3 billion.We did buy Applebee’s,” she said.One of her first calls? Informing the former Applebee’s CEO, the same one who had denied her the top role, that his services were no longer required.Looking back, Stewart described her business style after that defining chapter: “I became a stone-cold killer.”Her story has since become a corporate legend, proof that sometimes the harshest rejection sets the stage for the most powerful comeback.","Julia stewart was denied the top job at applebee's.

Why Britain is turning to flywheels for grid stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/old-tech-new-power-why-britain-is-turning-to-flywheels-for-grid-stability-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-system/articleshow/123611558.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny





Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out and replaced with renewable energy. Grid operators are increasingly relying on heavy spinning devices called flywheels to provide the inertia once supplied by fossil-fuel power stations, in order to prevent large-scale blackouts.Flywheels, used for centuries in machinery from potters’ wheels to steam engines, can mimic the stabilising effect of turbines in coal and gas plants by responding to sudden fluctuations in electricity supply and demand. Without such rotating systems, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise,"" said David Brayshaw, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. ""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" he told AFP.The challenge was underscored in April, when Spain and Portugal were hit by a major outage after their renewable-heavy grid failed to absorb a sudden surge in voltage. A similar incident in 2019 plunged parts of Britain into darkness and prompted the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to begin contracting grid-stabilising projects.Among the solutions, flywheels and batteries are being deployed to create “synthetic inertia”.According to engineering professor Keith Pullen of City St George's, University of London, steel flywheels could prove more cost-effective and longer-lasting than lithium-ion batteries. ""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, who also leads the startup Levistor.One of the flagship projects is Statkraft’s “Greener Grid Park” in Liverpool, operational since 2023. It uses two 40-ton flywheels attached to synchronous compensators to supply about one percent of Britain’s total grid inertia. ""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft’s head of zero-carbon grid solutions. NESO reports that at least 11 similar projects are already operational across the UK, with more on the way.Despite this progress, concerns remain. ""We aren't building them fast enough to decarbonise the grid,"" Nicholson warned, noting Britain’s target of 95 percent clean energy by 2030. ""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" he added, pointing out that gas turbines are still required to keep the grid stable.The government insists it is working with industry to scale up new stabilisation technologies. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the UK is collaborating with partners to roll out “world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system.”Still, experts say Britain and Ireland remain ahead of continental Europe in adopting such measures. ""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that. I think these things are driven by events. So, the Spanish blackout will drive change.""",Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out.

Why was Princess Diana’s time capsule sealed

Public and historical significance





A rare glimpse into the world of the early 1990s has been unlocked with the opening of a time capsule once linked to Princess Diana. Sealed more than three decades ago, the capsule has unveiled a fascinating collection of cultural artefacts and personal memorabilia that vividly capture the spirit of the era. From music and fashion to everyday consumer objects, the discoveries offer an intimate reflection of the time Diana lived through and the broader cultural landscape of the early ‘90s. The opening of the capsule has not only sparked renewed public curiosity about her life and legacy but also rekindled interest in the social history of a decade still fondly remembered today.The capsule’s contents painted a vivid picture of the early 1990s. Among the most striking discoveries was a Kylie Minogue CD, reflecting Diana’s well-known interest in contemporary music and her connection with pop culture. A small pocket-sized television symbolised the rapid shift in consumer technology at the time, when portable gadgets were becoming increasingly popular. Old newspapers preserved inside offered insights into the political and social debates of 1991, while glossy magazines highlighted the fashion trends that Diana herself helped popularise.Each artefact collectively recreated a snapshot of an era when Diana stood at the centre of both royal life and international celebrity culture.The creation of the time capsule was intended to preserve the essence of the moment for posterity. By capturing artefacts from 1991, the capsule became a curated window into Diana’s world—a year that marked both personal challenges and public triumphs for her. Historians suggest it was designed to reflect not only her personal interests but also the broader social and cultural context that defined the early 1990s. At a time when Diana was reshaping the image of the monarchy through her openness and relatability, the capsule stands as a symbolic act of remembrance, preserving tangible fragments of a rapidly changing world. Its opening now allows both fans and historians to connect more personally with Diana’s life and the era she influenced.The opening of the capsule has generated fascination far beyond royal enthusiasts. For the public, the contents stir nostalgia for a decade often remembered with fondness and curiosity. For historians, the capsule provides a rare cultural archive, bridging the gap between Diana’s personal story and broader historical currents. Newspapers and magazines inside the capsule act as valuable primary sources, allowing future generations to study not only Diana’s era but also the everyday concerns, entertainment, and technology of the time. It highlights how deeply Diana was embedded in the cultural fabric, not as a distant royal figure but as someone closely tied to global popular culture.The capsule has once again brought Diana’s enduring influence to the forefront. While the items inside may appear ordinary at first glance, their rediscovery has reminded the world of how extraordinary Diana’s presence was during her lifetime.
