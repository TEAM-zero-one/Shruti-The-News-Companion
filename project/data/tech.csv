Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver













The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the san francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

Iran Stuns Israel, Fires Hypersonic Missile Fattah-1 At Tel Aviv | Trump Demands Tehran's Surrender

Iran has reportedly went for a near-total Internet Blackout Tuesday (June 17) as conflict with Israel deepened. According to a report by NBC News, the drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran’s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. The report quotes Kentinc and Netblocks, the two companies that track global internet connectivity. According to NBC News, quoting these companies, Iran’s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians’ ability to access and share information with the outside world.The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks (VPNs) used to access foreign sites. Data published by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, reportedly said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.Iran’s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. In 2019, the country implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, reportedly said that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. He further said that app stores of Google and Apple -- Google Play Store and App Store -- had been blocked in Iran.A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran.What is not blocked in IranThe report said that Iran’s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran. As internet services are restricted in the country, some people have called for Elon Musk’s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in, the way it has in many parts of the world.","Iran has reportedly went for a near-total internet blackout tuesday (june 17) as conflict with israel deepened.

This move is part of CEO Lip-Bu Tan's restructuring efforts to cut costs and streamline operations amidst financial struggles and intense market competition.

No severances for fired employees, will be selected based on performance evaluations

Intel's factory layoffs add to CEO Tan's restructuring plans

Third major layoff round in just one year

Intel is preparing to lay off between 15% and 20% of its Intel Foundry workforce beginning in July, marking one of the largest job cuts in the semiconductor giant's history. The layoffs are expected to affect more than 10,000 employees worldwide, representing roughly one-fifth of the company's manufacturing division.""These are difficult actions but essential to meet our affordability challenges and current financial position of the company. It drives pain to every individual,"" Intel Manufacturing Vice President Naga Chandrasekaran wrote in an internal memo to employees over the weekend, as seen by The Oregonian.The cuts will impact Intel's foundry division across 15 wafer fabrication plants at 10 locations globally, affecting roles ranging from factory floor technicians to researchers developing next-generation microprocessors. Unlike previous layoffs, Intel will not offer voluntary buyouts or early retirement packages, instead selecting workers based on performance evaluations and strategic priorities.""These reductions will be based on a combination of portfolio changes, level and position elimination, skill assessment for remaining positions, and some hard decisions around our project investments,"" Chandrasekaran explained in the memo. ""We are also taking into consideration factory operations impact.""The foundry layoffs represent an acceleration of cost-cutting measures announced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan , who took over the company back in March this year. In April, Tan revealed plans to cut over 20% of Intel's total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring aimed at eliminating bureaucracy and rebuilding the company's engineering-focused culture.The 65-year-old executive has repeatedly emphasized the need to streamline operations and reduce management layers. ""I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan stated in an April memo to employees.Intel's workforce has steadily declined from nearly 125,000 employees in 2023 to approximately 109,000 by the end of 2024. The company reported an $821 million loss in the first quarter of 2025, continuing a pattern of financial struggles that have plagued the chipmaker.These cuts represent the third major layoff round in the period of one year. Intel first eliminated 15,000 jobs in August 2024 under former CEO Pat Gelsinger , which represented over 15% of its workforce at the time. Those layoffs included buyouts, early retirement offers, and voluntary departures as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Earlier this year, new CEO Tan announced additional workforce reductions of over 20% as part of his turnaround strategy.The latest restructuring comes as Intel faces intense competition in PC and data center markets while struggling to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom that has benefited rivals like Nvidia. The company has also grappled with delays in federal CHIPS Act funding, with much of its promised $7.9 billion subsidy package remaining uncertain under the Trump administration's review of ongoing awards.Key technical roles, including engineers working on advanced process technologies and technicians managing critical lithography equipment, are expected to be largely protected from the cuts, while positions made redundant by automation may face elimination.","Intel is set to implement significant layoffs, impacting 15% to 20% of its intel foundry workforce starting in july.

NEW DELHI: India has officially fired the starting shot in its race to develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet, inviting Indian aerospace firms to help build prototypes of the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a project billed as a major leap in indigenous defense capabilities.The Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), the design and development arm under the ministry of defence, has issued an expression of interest (EOI) to shortlist Indian companies for constructing five prototypes of the AMCA – a fifth-generation, twin-engine stealth fighter with deep-strike capabilities.The AMCA is expected to be a cornerstone of the Indian Air Force alongside the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft, with plans to eventually replace aging fleets and reduce dependence on foreign military aircraft.According to the ADA, only Indian-owned and -controlled companies are eligible. Single companies, joint ventures or consortiums with a proven track record in aerospace and defense manufacturing are being encouraged to apply. The selected firm will also be required to establish facilities capable of scaling into full-scale production once the prototype phase is complete.“This is not just about building prototypes,” the ADA said in its official communication.“It’s about identifying a long-term industrial partner capable of absorbing AMCA’s design and preparing for future series production.”The agency has set a strict timeline: all development, testing, and certification of the AMCA must be completed within eight years from the contract’s effective date.The AMCA project is central to India’s push for self-reliance in defense manufacturing. Once completed, the aircraft is expected to match the capabilities of other fifth-generation fighters like the US F-35 or China’s J-20, boasting stealth technology, advanced avionics, and supercruise capability.","The aeronautical development agency has issued an expression of interest to shortlist indian companies for constructing five prototypes of the amca.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI. While acknowledging that AI will inevitably transform roles and that humanity is undergoing a shift even greater than the Industrial Revolution, Demis Hassabis remains optimistic about human adaptability. He believes AI will lead to the emergence of ""new very valuable jobs,"" particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""Demis Hassabis's primary concern regarding AI lies not in job loss, but in its potential misuse by malicious actors. He stresses the urgent need for global regulation and an international framework to govern AI, likening it to a ""digital Geneva Convention,"" to prevent powerful AI systems from falling into the wrong hands.",Anthropic ceo dario amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Poll Do you believe US companies are adequately prepared for potential cyberattacks from Iranian-linked actors? No, they need to improve their defenses. Yes, they are well-prepared.

Two prominent US cybersecurity organizations , the Information Technology — Information Sharing and Analysis Center ( IT-ISAC ) and the Food and Agriculture Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Food and Ag-ISAC), have issued an urgent warning to American businesses across the country about a potential surge in cyberattacks from Iranian-linked actors. The alert comes as tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about cyber retaliation targeting US companies.In a joint statement released recently, the ISACs cautioned that Iranian state-sponsored hackers, pro-Iran hacktivist groups, and financially motivated cybercriminals have historically launched attacks against US organizations during periods of heightened conflict. The groups urged businesses, particularly those in critical infrastructure sectors, to bolster their cybersecurity defenses immediately.“Preparedness is critical to resilience,” the statement emphasized, calling on companies to assess their cybersecurity posture, familiarize themselves with Iranian-affiliated threat actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and enhance monitoring for suspicious activity. The ISACs also stressed the importance of employee training to recognize and report phishing emails and malicious links.The warning highlighted the risk of collateral damage, noting that cyberattacks aimed at Israeli targets could inadvertently disrupt US companies due to the interconnected nature of global digital networks. “Even attacks not directly targeting the US could have indirect effects,” the statement said.Both organizations are actively monitoring the situation and providing real-time intelligence to their members through tools like adversary attack playbooks and secure collaboration channels. They encouraged non-member companies to join their information-sharing networks to strengthen industry-wide cyber defenses.The Food and Ag-ISAC, established in 2023, supports the food and agriculture sector with threat intelligence and incident response resources. As global tensions rise, the ISACs underscored the need for heightened vigilance to protect critical infrastructure from potential disruptions.","The alert comes as tensions escalate between iran and israel, raising concerns about cyber retaliation targeting us companies.

Alcatel V3 Ultra Unboxing & Hands-on | Dual Display Mode, Sleek Design & More!

YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced. Speaking at a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival, Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless”. He was joined by creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution,” Mohan added.YouTube currently uses an earlier version of Veo in its Dream Screen feature, which creates AI-generated backgrounds. Veo 3 marks a major upgrade, offering more advanced video creation tools. Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts.Mohan said the new tool will “open new creative lanes” for Shorts creators, helping them experiment with content formats. YouTube Shorts, launched in 2021, now sees over 200 billion views per day, according to Mohan. Its growing popularity puts it in direct competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels.Mohan emphasized the role of creators in shaping modern entertainment. “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he said.“Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens.

Bill Gates warns: Alzheimer's treatment progress at risk without public funding

This is exactly when investment is most needed.

Government grants support large-scale clinical trials and early-stage science that private philanthropy cannot support on its own.

Scaling up biotech instruments such as blood tests and treatments necessitates infrastructures which only governments can develop and sustain.

“If we pull back now, all this progress could grind to a halt—and no private initiative can fill that gap,”

Gates’s vision: A future free from Alzheimer’s tragedy



Early detection technologies detect the disease years before symptoms arise.

Targeted treatments halt or slow the disease, maintaining quality of life.

Funding and public support fuel a massive research pipeline.

Five years ago, Bill Gates experienced one of the most severe personal losses of his life: seeing his father, William H. Gates Sr., suffer through the heartless advance of Alzheimer's disease. In a stunning new essay on Gates Notes, the Microsoft co-founder vividly remembers,That experience has since driven his dedication to fighting this ruinous condition, not only through philanthropy, but through sheer technological and scientific push.On the cutting edge of Alzheimer's research today, Bill Gates finds reasons for real hope. Following his visit to Indiana University's School of Medicine in 2024, he was invigorated by what he described as ""the latest breakthrough"": blood tests that could diagnose Alzheimer's years before signs of the disease show up. Combined with recently approved medications that slightly slow the march of the disease, Gates feels the world is moving closer to a day when no one will have to suffer the agony of losing a loved one. As he states,Alzheimer's is not only a health or numerical problem for Bill Gates—it's personal. More than 7 million Americans have Alzheimer's today, including almost 1 in 9 individuals aged 65 and older. And although treatment advances have seemed glacial, Gates's path has been a witness to love-driven perseverance. Spurred on by his father's pain and his call to action, Gates has emerged as one of the most vocal voices urging more money, improved tools, and increased urgency in Alzheimer's research.When Gates visited IU's School of Medicine, he discovered a revolution in the making for Alzheimer's care: blood tests to diagnose Alzheimer's. The tests quantify the amount and ratio of amyloid plaques and tau proteins—Alzheimer's signatures in the brain, years before full-blown symptoms emerge.Gates calls these advances a ""game-changer""—not only for researchers, but also for families and caregivers who have felt helpless against the advancement of the disease.Encouraging therapy isn't confined to diagnosis. In the past few months, the US Food and Drug Administration has licensed two novel Alzheimer's medications that have been demonstrated to moderately decelerate disease exacerbation. Though not cures, these medications constitute a significant turning point—from symptom treatment to addressing core pathology.Gates's enthusiasm is palpable:Despite advances in science, Gates warns of an impending crisis: dwindling public funding. Over the past few months, budgets for the National Institutes of Health and connected research agencies have been trimmed, just when momentum is gaining steam.He argues:Gates writes.Over the past few years, Alzheimer's seemed like a black hole of despair—until now. Gates spotlights some of the reasons why the tide is turning:For Bill Gates, fighting Alzheimer's is not about making headlines—it's about saving families the emotional anguish he suffered personally. He dreams of a world where:In his most passionate sentence, Gates pleads: “We are on the cusp of turning the tide against dementia.” But he also warns that urgency must be followed by action—more money, more research, more courage in science.","Bill gates' fight against alzheimer's is deeply personal.

Sales teams face heaviest impact at Microsoft

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined to sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.","Microsoft plans to cut thousands of jobs in july, primarily targeting its sales division.

What makes Indian Creek so special

Bezos effect: Indian Creek real estate hits $105 million and rising

Future of ‘billionaire bunker’: More tech, more fortresses

Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!

In a record-setting real estate transaction that has sent ripples through Miami’s luxury property market, a vacant 1.84-acre lot on Indian Creek Island has sold for a staggering $105 million, as per Forbes reports. This isn’t just any neighbourhood. Indian Creek, often dubbed the “billionaire bunker,” is a hyper-exclusive, man-made island that’s home to some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy figures, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and NFL legend Tom Brady. With just 41 properties and its private police force, the island offers the kind of privacy, security, and prestige that attracts the elite.The seller, German developer Mikhail Peleg, originally purchased the land for $27.5 million in 2018. The recent all-cash deal marks a near fourfold return on his investment, setting a new price record for the island and raising the bar on what land, let alone a developed mansion, can fetch in one of America’s most secretive enclaves. This high-stakes, high-tech neighbourhood is now squarely on the radar of both real estate watchers and Silicon Valley insiders.The $105 million sale smashes the island’s previous record set just a year ago in May 2024 when Jeff Bezos paid $87 million for his third property on Indian Creek. Peleg’s lot, which faces Biscayne Bay to the west, shares borders with two of Bezos’ neighbouring parcels, which the Amazon founder acquired for $68 million and $79 million, respectively, in 2023.Initially listed for an eye-popping $200 million in late 2024, the plot saw immediate attention from ultra-high-net-worth buyers around the world. By the first day of listing, multiple offers poured in, many hovering close to the $100 million mark, according to listing broker Ilya Reznik.“Strategically, it’s the best piece of land in Miami,” Reznik said. “You’re not just buying dirt. You’re buying access to a world most people don’t even know exists.”Mikhail Peleg had once intended to build a dream home on the lot, but shifted plans after deciding not to move to the US The surging real estate values on Indian Creek were a compelling reason to sell.“He’s a savvy investor. The timing was right,” said Daniel Rudoy, Peleg’s attorney. “When you’re sitting next to Bezos’ compound and demand is this hot, you don’t wait around.”To finance the original purchase, Peleg took out a $20 million mortgage, later refinancing and expanding it to $41 million. Interestingly, the refinancing was tied to a business entity connected to British billionaires David and Simon Reuben, adding another layer of intrigue to the deal among the billionaire community.Indian Creek isn’t just about property, it’s about power, privacy, and presence. The island is patrolled by its police department, surveillance boats circle its shores, and no one gets on or off without notice. Air surveillance adds another layer of protection.“It’s like a fortress,” Rudoy explained. “There’s no place like it in the US, maybe not even the world.”Unlike sprawling estates in Beverly Hills or Manhattan’s penthouses, Indian Creek offers complete isolation with immediate water access, giving its residents the ability to sail in and out without setting foot on public roads. It’s no coincidence that the richest man in the world chose this island for his escape.Indian Creek’s real estate prices have skyrocketed in the past two decades. In the early 2000s, waterfront homes on the island were selling for single-digit millions. By the 2010s, prices were averaging above $30 million. But the arrival of Jeff Bezos, along with a wave of tech executives and hedge fund magnates, has redefined the ceiling.“Bezos changed everything,” said Dina Goldentayer, a luxury real estate agent at Douglas Elliman. “When you see that kind of capital pouring in, suddenly $100 million doesn’t seem outlandish anymore.”With Peleg’s record-setting sale, other property owners on Indian Creek are likely to adjust their expectations and their listing prices accordingly.“Now, anyone with a house is going to say, ‘If the dirt is worth $105 million, what’s my estate worth?’” Goldentayer added.The Indian Creek sale signals a broader trend: the convergence of extreme wealth, technology, and geographic retreat. In a post-pandemic world shaped by security concerns, remote work, and digital empires, high-profile figures are increasingly drawn to controlled environments like Indian Creek.“Buyers call me and say, ‘I want in on Indian Creek. What’s the entry point?’” Goldentayer shared. “Sometimes the price doesn’t even matter; it’s about access.”This trend is mirrored across global elite enclaves from London’s Billionaires’ Row to the Hamptons, but Indian Creek’s complete privatisation and proximity to Latin America’s wealth corridors give it a uniquely strategic edge.","A vacant 1.84-acre lot on indian creek island has sold for a staggering $105 million, as per forbes reports.

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey hinton, the “godfather of ai,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

The official said that imports will be allowed for industrial and manufacturing sectors, including electronics, electrical and specialised chemical industry against an import authorisation, thereby addressing the need of the domestic industry without disruption for actual use.In a separate notification, the Directorate said that the import of palladium, rhodium and iridium alloy consisting of gold more than 1% by weight is restricted. This measure expands upon the existing restriction on the import of platinum to bring uniformity in the import policy governing precious metals and their alloys. agencies",Colloidal precious metals are suspensions of gold or silver nanoparticles dispersed in liquid.
