NEW DELHI: A preliminary probe into the June 12 AI-171 crash finds no ""mechanical or maintenance issues"" with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft and its engines, and also no fault with fuel quality and ""medical status"" of the pilots, according to the airline's CEO Campbell Wilson.In his first internal note to employees since the report's release, Wilson acknowledged the findings but cautioned against speculation. ""The preliminary report identified no cause nor made any recommendations,"" he wrote Monday. ""I urge everyone to avoid drawing premature conclusions as the investigation is far from over.""Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's initial report concluded that ""all mandatory maintenance tasks had been completed"" and ""no mechanical or maintenance issues"" were detected. Fuel quality and take-off roll were cleared, as were pilot breathalyser and medical checks.The report has raised eyebrows within aviation circles - not for what it reveals, but for what it omits. Released in India nearly two days after being shared with sections of western media, the report has triggered new rounds of speculation, including a disputed suicide theory strongly denied by the pilot community.""There was no issue with quality of fuel and no abnormality with the take-off roll,"" Wilson said.""The pilots had passed their mandatory pre-flight breathalyser and there were no observations pertaining to their medical status.""India's first wide-body aircraft disaster in decades has shaken public confidence in Air India. The airline has since cut multiple flights, both on wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, as it works to stabilise operations.""Despite the shared grief, I could not be prouder of the togetherness, compassion and resilience that you have all shown,"" Wilson wrote to Air India's staff. ""We must remain focused on our task and be true to values that have powered Air India's transformation - integrity, excellence, customer focus, innovation and teamwork.""Wilson said preliminary findings bring ""greater clarity"" but also open ""additional questions"". He underscored the psychological toll of the crash on staff and the broader aviation community, especially amid unfounded theories.To reassure passengers, Wilson said that ""out of an abundance of caution and under oversight of DGCA, every Boeing 787 aircraft operating in our fleet was checked within days of the accident and all were found fit for service"".","Preliminary probe finds no ""mechanical or maintenance issues"" with the boeing 787-8 dreamliner aircraft.

Tom Brady’s rumoured romance with Sofia Vergara is the talk of the town ever since the two were spotted at Jeff Bezos’ wedding in Venice.

It seems their age might be a reason why Sofia Vergara won’t proceed any further with the NFL legend.However, neither Tom Brady nor Sofia Vergara have confirmed such speculations and continue to be silent about their rumoured romance.Apart from being linked with the Modern Family star, Tom Brady has also been linked with Hollywood actress and 27 year old Euphoria actress, Sydney Sweeney.

The source said, “She went into the trip with very high hopes — she knew Tom Brady was invited and she has a huge crush on him.

In an aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore), highlighting the fierce talent war in AI recruitment today. Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world, even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning. Meta is reportedly in talks with several more prominent figures in AI research and robotics, indicating further expansions to the Superintelligence Lab. Zuckerberg's vision now goes beyond just algorithms. It encompasses building infrastructure, supercomputers, and even AI-native hardware to support future breakthroughs. The message is clear: Meta is betting its future on superintelligence.","Meta ceo mark zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new superintelligence lab.

How this one simple habit became Sengupta’s superpower



Why founders need mental clarity now more than ever



Inner stillness as the new startup strategy



Also Read |

In today’s high-octane startup world, where billion-dollar valuations can vanish overnight and hustle culture dominates, surviving the chaos requires more than grit, strategy, or even funding. According to Caesar Sengupta , co-founder and CEO of the digital wealth platform Arta Finance, and former Google Pay executive, entrepreneurs need something surprisingly simple yet profoundly powerful: stillness. Sengupta believes that daily meditation—not constant motion—is his ultimate superpower. And as neuroscience begins to validate this approach with compelling research, the message is clear: in the noisy, demanding world of startups, mental clarity, mindfulness, and emotional resilience might be the most underutilized, discover-worthy competitive edge for today’s ambitious entrepreneurs seeking sustainable success and peak performance.Before launching Arta Finance in 2021,a fintech company now backed by over $92 million in funding, including support from Sequoia Capital India and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta spent 15 years at Google. He helped build ChromeOS and co-founded Google Pay, which now serves more than 150 million users across 30+ countries.Despite his impressive resume, Sengupta admits the transition from corporate stability to startup chaos was mentally jarring. “There are days where you feel 100%, and there are days where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what did I just do?’” he confessed. Startups, he explained, can consume founders entirely—damaging health, relationships, and emotional well-being.His solution wasn’t found in a productivity hack or another to-do list app. It was far simpler: five to ten minutes of meditation a day. “I wish three years back, somebody had sat me down and said: ‘Dude… just meditate,’” as reported by CNBC. That small window of silence became his daily anchor, offering mental space amidst a storm of decisions, investor meetings, and constant uncertainty.While Sengupta calls mindfulness his ""superpower,"" neuroscience is catching up to the claim. A recent study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, reported by Neuroscience News, found that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation significantly enhanced focus and reduced distractibility across all age groups.Using eye-tracking technology, researchers observed improved reaction times and sustained attention—especially linked to changes in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system, a brain center critical to focus, memory, and cognitive resilience. As postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim put it, “Mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed — it can literally change the way your brain handles attention.”Founders today are under immense pressure navigating product launches, investor meetings, sleepless nights, and the ever-looming threat of failure. In such an environment, the ability to filter signals from noise isn’t just helpful, it's essential for survival.Sengupta also turns to cycling as a form of meditative movement. “It’s one of the only times where no one can reach me,” he says. This physical form of stillness helps him mentally recharge and stay grounded amid the chaos of building a high-stakes startup.As mindfulness gains ground in scientific and executive circles alike, Sengupta’s approach is emerging as more than just a personal quirk—it’s a strategic advantage. While others burn out chasing every opportunity, he’s choosing calm over chaos. And it’s working.“Ultimately,” he says, “it’s about how you confront the ups and downs of life.” For today’s entrepreneurs, Sengupta’s journey offers a profound lesson: in a world obsessed with speed, stillness may be your sharpest edge.","Former google executive caesar sengupta finds startup life more chaotic than expected. He believes that daily meditation, not constant motion, is his ultimate superpower. As neuroscience begins to validate this approach, the message is clear: mental clarity, mindfulness, and emotional resilience might be the most underutilized competitive edge for today’s ambitious entrepreneurs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122400266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20944,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N nvidia finished trading on july 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion.

Role of Indian food and culture



On caste identity







Indian-Americans are leaning more towards their Indian identity than before and they feel they are equally Indian and American, though they are born in the US, a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace revealed. The report based on the 2024 Indian-American Attitude Survey revealed that 86 per cent of US-born Indian-Americans said being Indian is an important party of their upbringing, while the figure was 70 per cent in 2020. The proportion of respondents identifying as “Indian American” dropped, while the proportion identifying as “Asian Indian” rose, the report said.The survey was conducted online over 1206 Indian-American adults by polling firm YouGov including both US citizens and non-citizen respondents.“The idea of being both Indian and American is becoming stronger,” the report said.""Noncitizens had the greatest degree of personal, ongoing connection with India, but both U.S.-born and naturalized citizens did exhibit significant cultural connections with their Indian roots. For instance, in aggregate, eight in ten Indian Americans reported eating Indian food in the month prior to the survey,"" the report said.65 per cent watched Indian television or movies in the past month when the survey was done, while 38 per cent engaged with Indian dance, music, or art in some form or fashion in the past six months. Only 7 per cent of respondents reported engaging in none of these cultural practices.The report said 32 per cent of survey respondents reported that they did not identify with any caste. 46 per cent identified as General or Upper caste. The overwhelming majority of Indian American respondents supported measures to formally outlaw caste discrimination. ""One in two respondents reported experiencing discrimination in the past one year, the most common form of which was biased treatment based on skin color. Indian Americans perceived discrimination against Muslims to be especially common,"" it said.","86 per cent of us-born indian-americans said being indian is an important party of their upbringing.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann watson, a former citigroup employee, was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with indians.

Wizz Air, the Hungary-based low-cost airline, has announced it will suspend all operations under its Abu Dhabi-based subsidiary,, by September 1, 2025. The decision marks the end of a five-year push to establish a low-cost aviation hub in the Gulf region and brings its partnership with the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company () to a close.The move will result in the cessation of all Wizz Air flights operating from Zayed International Airport (AUH) after August 31, 2025, effectively eliminating Wizz Air’s operational presence in the Gulf. The airline confirmed that passengers with bookings beyond August 31 will be contacted and offered refunds or alternative travel arrangements. Customers who purchased tickets through travel agents or third-party platforms have been advised to coordinate directly with their point of purchase.Wizz Air’s joint venture with ADQ, launched in 2020, was designed to support Abu Dhabi’s broader aviation diversification goals, and the carrier had originally planned to expand to a fleet of 100 aircraft in the region over a 15-year period. However, a combination of economic and operational headwinds forced a strategic rethink.The company cited several critical challenges behind its decision to exit the market:In fact, CEO József Váradi had previously stated that the airline would reduce operations in “hot and harsh environments,” as these conditions cause accelerated engine wear.These same maintenance challenges were among the key reasons the airline chose to pull back from Abu Dhabi.“The operating environment has changed significantly. Supply chain constraints, geopolitical instability, and limited market access have made it increasingly difficult to sustain our original ambitions,” said József Váradi, CEO of Wizz Air.He added:“While this was a difficult decision, it is the right one given the current market dynamics. It will help Wizz Air focus on its core markets and initiatives that improve the airline’s customer proposition and build shareholder value.”Wizz Air assured its customers that bookings made for travel after August 31 will be addressed either through refunds or alternative travel solutions. The company emphasized that the suspension affects only flights operated by Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, and that other operations across the broader Wizz Air group, such as Wizz Air Malta and Wizz Air UK, will continue as normal.The exit from the Abu Dhabi market also signifies the end of Wizz Air’s ambitions to use the UAE capital as a gateway to destinations in Asia, Africa, and Central Europe. Since its establishment in late 2020, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi faced significant obstacles that limited route expansion and stifled plans for broader connectivity.Despite the airline’s original plan to scale rapidly, constraints on market access, regional red tape, and limited airspace availability made scaling up nearly impossible. With these compounded issues, the operation remained limited to a small number of destinations, far short of its original vision.Following the wind-down in the Gulf, Wizz Air will intensify its strategic focus on its core markets in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as on selected Western European countries including Austria, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The airline sees these regions as offering greater long-term potential for sustainable growth and profitability.“This strategic realignment to core markets will enable the Company to redeploy resources to regions with greater long-term potential for sustainable growth and profitability,” the airline said in its official statement.Wizz Air currently operates a fleet of 237 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft and served 63.4 million passengers in fiscal year 2025. The company expects this realignment to optimize its resources and enhance shareholder returns, while reinforcing its footprint in the European market, where it sees stronger demand and fewer regulatory complications.In closing, CEO Váradi acknowledged the contributions of the airline’s Gulf-based employees and partners, stating:“We are grateful to our employees in the UAE and partners in Abu Dhabi for their commitment to building the Wizz Air brand in the region.”All flights will end after August 31, 2025.You’ll receive a refund or alternative travel option.Due to engine issues, regulatory limits, and geopolitical factors.No, it only impacts Wizz Air Abu Dhabi operations.You should contact them directly to manage your booking.","Wizz air has announced it will suspend all operations under its abu dhabi-based subsidiary, by september 1, 2025.

FAQs

Q1. How can I tell if a Wi-Fi network is a honeypot?

Q2. Is using a VPN enough to stay safe on public Wi-Fi?

Q3. What should I do if I suspect I’ve connected to a fake Wi-Fi hotspot?





When you travel abroad, connecting to free Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, or cafés seems harmless. It’s fast, easy, and usually part of the plan. But that free internet can come with hidden dangers you might not expect. Many UAE residents don’t realize that cybercriminals can use these networks against them.Hackers create fake Wi-Fi networks that look legitimate. These traps are called honeypots. They trick users into connecting so hackers can steal sensitive data like passwords, emails, or even banking details. Unlike a visible virus or attack, this kind of threat is silent. You might never know you’ve been targeted.Even real public Wi-Fi isn’t always safe. Many lack strong security, making it easier for hackers to eavesdrop or push malware to your device. The UAE Cyber Security Council warns travelers to be cautious and protect their digital lives.A honeypot is a fake Wi-Fi network set up by hackers. It looks like a normal public network, think “Airport_Free_WiFi” or “Hotel_Guest.” But when you connect, your data can be intercepted. Hackers can watch your online activity, steal passwords, or even access your private messages.These fake hotspots are dangerous because they don’t require passwords or verification. They are designed to be attractive so you’ll join quickly, without thinking twice.This is one of the most common ways hackers steal your data on public Wi-Fi. Imagine you’re talking to a friend, but someone else secretly listens in and can even change the conversation. That’s a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers can insert themselves between your device and the website you’re visiting. They can capture your login info, credit card numbers, or private messages. And since it happens quietly, you usually won’t notice until it’s too late.Public Wi-Fi networks, even real ones, usually don’t use strong encryption. Encryption is like a lock for your data. Without it, anyone nearby can listen to your internet traffic. Hackers can inject malware or redirect you to fake websites designed to steal your information.Also, many public networks require you to agree to terms and conditions before connecting. These agreements sometimes give the network permission to track your location, monitor your browsing habits, or collect personal data. Most people click “” without reading, unknowingly giving up privacy.Here are simple steps to protect your data when using public Wi-Fi abroad:It’s hard to tell just by the name. If the network name looks generic or suspicious, or if it doesn’t require a password, be cautious. Ask staff to confirm the official network.A VPN greatly improves your security by encrypting your data. But you should still avoid risky activities like banking or sharing sensitive info on public networks.Disconnect immediately. Change your passwords, especially for important accounts. Run a malware scan on your device and monitor your accounts for unusual activity.","Hackers use fake wi-fi hotspots called honeypots to steal data.
