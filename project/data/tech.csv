From access to agency: Uplifting India’s marginalised,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-access-to-agency-uplifting-indias-marginalised/articleshow/122239110.cms,".

.

India’s empowerment journey is at a critical inflection point. While its developmental story often showcases soaring GDP figures and rising global stature, this progress masks a more complex reality. For millions on the margins, advancement remains a distant promise. Caste, gender, disability, religion, and sexuality frequently intersect, forging layers of exclusion that persist despite legislative guarantees.It’s in these invisible trenches that the real battle for empowerment is unfolding — quiet, yet transformational. At the heart of this shift is a recalibration of what empowerment means.No longer is it just about delivering benefits. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and feminist scholar Naila Kabeer argue, empowerment must expand people’s capabilities and life choices. That means not merely giving marginalisedcommunities access to goods and services, but enabling them to exercise voice, agency, and dignity.India has, in recent years, initiated an array of legal and policy instruments to address entrenched inequities. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016), Forest Rights Act (2006), and Transgender Persons Act (2019) are emblematic of this shift.Schemes like MGNREGA and the Ujjwala Yojana have brought work and clean fuel to rural doorsteps. Yet implementation reveals uneven outcomes, especially among Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and women with disabilities.Bihar’s Viklang Sashaktikaran Yojna and Telangana’s Aasara pension scheme are examples of state-level adaptations that attempt to bridge local gaps. Civil society networks like Wada Na Todo Abhiyan monitor and pressure govts to fulfil promises, adding a layer of accountability. Meanwhile, institutions such as NITI Aayog ’s SDG coordination centres are beginning to integrate community voices in planning and monitoring processes.But real change hinges on more than schemes. It requires systems that understand complexity. A tribal woman with a disability, for instance, doesn’t just need a wheelchair ramp. She needs coordinated entitlements, accessible communication, and community support that acknowledges the multi-layered nature of her exclusion.Corporate India, too, is stepping in with purpose. CSR is evolving beyond cheque-writing. Projects like ITC’s Mission Sunehra Kal, which has mobilised over 3.5 lakh women into self-help groups, or HUL’s Project Shakti, empowering over 1.3 lakh rural women with entrepreneurship and hygiene training, are crafting new templates for inclusive growth. Vedanta’s Nand Ghar and NTPC’s Girl Empowerment Mission are weaving nutrition, education, and health into holistic empowerment.These initiatives are not without limitations. Intersectional targeting is still nascent. While SC/ST inclusion has improved, a closer look reveals gaps in addressing compounded vulnerabilities—say, for transgender persons with disabilities or religious minorities in remote areas.CSR interventions must therefore move from outcome counting to impact mapping, using tools like storytelling, community audits, and life histories to understand what change looks like from the ground. International partnerships add momentum. UNDP-supported projects like the Gender Seal for Development are institutionalising gender equity across health systems and skilling programmes like SMILE.A major structural reform is the govt’s push for third-party evaluations of centrally-sponsored schemes, undertaken by the Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO). These assessments are unearthing the gaps and successes that often escape attention.The convergence of law, policy, civil society, and corporate commitment offers an unparalleled opportunity. But the real test lies in embedding intersectionality — in seeing the individual not just through one identity marker but through all that shapes their lived reality. Welfare delivery must give way to systems of recognition, redistribution, and representation.Only then will India’s growth story be truly inclusive, not just in charts and numbers, but in lives changed, voices heard, and futures reimagined.","India has initiated an array of legal and policy instruments to address entrenched inequities.

Startups to giants: India rides the AI wave to sustainability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/startups-to-giants-india-rides-the-ai-wave-to-sustainability/articleshow/122238919.cms,"India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence (AI) with sustainable development. As the world faces mounting climate challenges, the country’s businesses, ranging from IT behemoths to climate-tech start-ups, are weaving AI into the fabric of their green goals, making India one of the most AI-active nations in sustainability initiatives.A striking 64% of Indian companies are now actively deploying AI to boost the impact of their sustainability efforts — the highest proportion among surveyed countries, according to IBM’s 2024 sustainability readiness study. This isn’t just a sign of technological enthusiasm, but of a maturing mindset that places environmental responsibility at the heart of corporate strategy.India’s journey is as much about economic transformation as it is about ecological conscience. In 2022–23, the digital economy accounted for nearly 12% of the national income, underlining the country’s success in harnessing tech for green growth.Take Infosys, for instance. The IT giant achieved carbon neutrality in 2020 — well ahead of global targets — by using AI and digital tools to drive energy efficiency, adopt renewables, and run offset projects that also benefit rural communities. The company was also the first Indian firm to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity.But it’s not just industry titans making waves. India’s climate-tech ecosystem now boasts over 800 operational start-ups, which have collectively raised more than $3.6 billion between 2014 and 2024.Among them is Alt Carbon, a venture leading the charge in carbon removal technologies. The company combines geochemical innovation, environmental data platforms, and scientific validation to sequester CO 2 through enhanced rock weathering and soil improvement on farmland. With its cutting-edge platform ‘Atlas’, Alt Carbon can monitor soil chemistry, water dynamics, and ecosystem health at high resolution, and aims to remove 5 million metric tons of CO 2 by 2030. AI and other emerging technologies like IoT (internet of things), 5G, and blockchain are transforming how Indian enterprises think about sustainability. From resource-efficient smart grids to traceable, ethical supply chains and real-time emissions monitoring, digital tools are offering tangible solutions to previously intractable problems.This momentum is also evident in platforms such as EY’s ESG Compass, which supports businesses in navigating ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance) goals through data automation, risk analytics, and benchmarking tools. Such solutions are helping organisations make more informed, sustainable decisions while increasing transparency for stakeholders.Yet, as PM Narendra Modi recently reminded the world at the AI Action Summit 2025, sustainable AI must not merely be powered by clean energy, but also be efficient by design—light on data, lean on compute power, and accessible to the broader developer community. “After all,” he said, “the human brain can compose poetry and design spaceships while using less power than most light bulbs.”Indeed, while AI tools are proving their worth, there are pressing concerns that must be addressed — particularly around data privacy, interoperability, and ethical design. Most current sustainability-driven AI tools focus on energy emissions during training, often ignoring emissions during the deployment and inference phases. Moreover, many are tailored for highly skilled developers, limiting access for users relying on APIs or nocode platforms.As The Times of India Social Impact Summit approaches, the conversation is expected to pivot around these very themes: how to scale tech-enabled ESG and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) efforts, ensure inclusive adoption, and drive measurable impact.With diverse stakeholders converging, the summit presented by Malabar Gold & Diamonds — Ernst & Young is knowledge partner — aims to serve as a crucible for collaboration and future-ready sustainability solutions. It is being held on July 11 and 12, 2025, in Mumbai.","India is fast becoming a global vanguard in marrying artificial intelligence (ai) with sustainable development.

NEW DELHI: The social media accounts of several Pakistani actors and cricketers remain blocked after it was reported that certain celeb accounts were now accessible to Indian users.On Wednesday, Instagram accounts of certain Pakistan actors, including Mawra Hocane, Saba Qamar, Ahad Raza Mir, Yumna Zaidi, and Danish Taimoor, briefly appeared to be accessible to the Indian audience. This sparked outrage. However, as of Thursday morning these accounts continue to be withheld in country.Upon searching for their accounts, users can see a message: ""Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content."" However, YouTube channels of Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar and entertainment channels like Green TV are still available for viewing in India.However, prominent Pakistani actors, such as Fawad Khan, Mahira Khan, and Hania Aamir, are still not accessible to Indian users on Instagram, as their accounts remain blocked.India had banned social media of several Pakistani actors and cricketers after they reportedly spewed anti-India content after Operation Sindoor , which was launched on May 7 in response to a terror attack in Pahalgam that claimed 26 lives.Earlier in April, India had announced a ban on 16 Pakistani YouTube channels for spreading provocative and communally sensitive content and misinformation against India, its Army and security agencies in the backdrop of Pahalgam attack.The significant action followed recommendations of ministry of home affairs (MHA). These channels were found to be disseminating false and unverified information related to India's national security, foreign relations, and public order.","Instagram accounts of certain pakistan actors briefly appeared to be accessible to the indian audience.

"10 state-of-the-art Isro techs transferred to Indian firms, says IN-SPACe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/10-state-of-the-art-isro-techs-transferred-to-indian-firms-says-in-space/articleshow/122236034.cms,"NEW DELHI: The country’s space regulator-cum-promoter Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) on Thursday said it facilitated the transfer of 10 state-of-the-art technologies developed by Isro to six Indian companies.The tripartite technology transfer agreements, signed among NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), six companies and IN-SPACe at the regulator’s headquarters in Ahmedabad, will give private players the opportunity to access developed technologies available with Isro, enabling them to use space-related technology for commercial applications in space as well as other sectors. The technologies that foster satellite launch, ground station infrastructure and geospatial applications are expected to deepen industry participation, enable indigenisation and reduce dependency on foreign technologies.Two advanced inertial sensors — Laser Gyroscope and Ceramic Servo Accelerometer — developed by Isro’s inertial systems unit for potential use in satellite launch vehicles have been transferred to Hyderabad-based Zetatek Technologies, which has over 25 years of expertise in inertial navigation system (INS) testing, calibration and QA/QT equipment. Three technologies related to ground station operations — S/X/Ka tri-band dual circular polarised monopulse feed, tri-axis antenna control servo system and Ku/C/L and S Band Cassegrain feed — have been transferred to Avantel and Jisnu Communications, Hyderabad-based companies specialising in end-to-end communications solutions for space and defence platforms.These technologies, currently sourced from foreign vendors, will enable self-reliance in critical ground station infrastructure.Reacting to the development, IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said, “Transfer of these technologies marks yet another significant step towards empowering the private sector to harness and commercialise space technologies. Isro has a flourishing repository of R&D in space technologies, and it is time we leverage that to the optimum to strengthen India’s space industrial ecosystem, and in that, industry-led innovation will play a key role. ”Further, two geospatial models developed by Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre of Isro for pest forewarning and semi-physical crop yield estimation were transferred to Ahmedabad-based Amnex Info Technologies, to be deployed in agricultural decision-making and crop protection. A compact, multi-parameter, portable bathymetry system developed by Isro’s National Remote Sensing Centre has been transferred to Jalkruti Water Solutions, Ahmedabad, to enable UAV-based integration for water resource monitoring.Further, Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre’s ceramic-based flame-proof coating technology, which was originally developed for launch vehicle applications, has been acquired by Ramdev Chemicals, Ahmedabad, for wider industrial applications.","The technologies foster satellite launch, ground station infrastructure and geospatial applications.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae cervantes worked as an engineering technician at tesla's gigafactory in nevada for seven years.

Caitlin Clark’s $150M sneaker hype grows ahead of 2026 signature shoe launch



Caitlin Clark is one of the most well-known figures in women's basketball. Due to her popularity, many brands want to work with her. Her fame helped her sell her signature shoes. Industry insiders estimate that her first signature sneakers could be worth up to $150 million. Earlier this year, she signed a contract with Nike. Now, fans are waiting for her first signature shoe to be released, which will likely come out in 2026.Days after being chosen by the Indiana Fever as the first overall pick, WNBA player Caitlin Clark signed an eight-year, $28 million contract with Nike in April 2024. Since then, a lot of Clark-branded jerseys, hoodies, T-shirts, and hats have been sold by Nike. However, her official signature shoe is still expected to launch next year.Recently, Nike dropped a special ""Caitlin Clark"" edition of the Kobe V Protro. The shoe, featuring midnight navy, bright crimson, and university gold colors, sold out within minutes after its release.These Clark-themed sneakers have now flooded resale platforms and are being listed for nearly $400 on sites like eBay. Sneaker expert and journalist Nick DePaula talked about this on a recent episode of Front Office Sports Today. He said:“I think when Caitlin’s shoe comes out it can be a $150 million business… It could become a top five signature franchise across basketball.”Given that Nike normally takes two years to create signature models, Caitlin Clark's signature shoe is anticipated to debut in the spring of next year. Nick DePaula further claimed that the company is taking its time and being methodical in the process. He said: “They want to get it right.”At the moment, the WNBA legend is sporting custom Kobe exclusives during games. However, excitement around her signature line continues to build.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation .

The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future. Meta’s new superintelligence team is just the latest proof that without immigration, there is no AI revolution.Previously at OpenAIMaster of Science (M.Sc.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel ceo lip-bu tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

How Dubai residents with Dh15k-20k salary can now buy a Dh1 million house with 'first home' initiative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-dubai-residents-with-dh15k-20k-salary-can-now-buy-a-dh1-million-house-with-first-home-initiative/articleshow/122233462.cms,"Backed by 13 developers and 5 banks, the initiative helps Dubai residents earning Dh15,000 to Dh20,000 buy a home with up to 10% discounts and affordable mortgages (Representative image)

Step 1: Determine Affordability and Choose the Right Property

30% of Dh18,000 = Dh5,400

This means that, ideally, your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed Dh5,400.





Step 2: Mortgage Breakdown and Affordability

Loan Amount: Dh900,000 (after taking the full 10% discount for estimate on the original property price of Dh1,000,000).





Interest Rate: 3.5% per annum





Loan Tenure: 18 years









Step 3: Plan for Upfront Costs and Financing

Initial Investment: Dh200,000





Discounted Property Price: Dh900,000 (after 10% discount)





Loan Amount: Dh700,000





Monthly original Payment: Dh5,544

Savings: If you’ve been saving for a while, now is the time to use those funds for your home purchase.





Employer Assistance: Some companies offer home loan assistance or partnerships with financial institutions that may help with the down payment.





Personal Loans or Support: If necessary, you might consider a personal loan to cover part of the down payment, though this should be done carefully to avoid over-leveraging.

Step 4: Maximize Program Benefits and Get Expert Support

Choose the Right Property: Stay within the Dh1 million price range to keep your mortgage payments manageable (under 30% of your salary).





Leverage Discounts: Use up to 10% discounts on property prices. For instance, if a home is priced at Dh900,000, you’ll only finance Dh810,000, reducing monthly payments.





Use Flexible Payment Plans: Opt for flexible payment plans on off-plan units that let you pay part of the cost upfront and spread the rest over time.





DLD Fee Benefits: Take advantage of the option to pay Dubai Land Department (DLD) registration fees in interest-free instalments, easing your upfront costs.





(DLD) registration fees in interest-free instalments, easing your upfront costs. Work With the Right Broker: Partner with a licensed broker to find properties that match your budget and eligibility criteria.





Get Pre-Approved for Financing: Secure pre-approval from a participating bank to understand what you can afford and streamline the home-buying process.

Disclaimer: The figures provided are rough estimates, meant to illustrate how the First-Time Homeownership Initiative can make homeownership more accessible. Actual costs, discounts, and mortgage terms may vary based on factors such as bank policies, property specifics, and developer offers.





For many Dubai residents earning between Dh15,000 and Dh20,000 per month, owning a home has long seemed out of reach, especially with property prices frequently surpassing Dh1 million. However, Dubai's new First-Time Homeownership Initiative, aimed at making homeownership accessible to first-time buyers, offers support for properties priced up to Dh5 million. Backed by 13 developers and 5 major banks, the program provides significant benefits, including priority access to new off-plan units, preferential pricing, and direct discounts of up to 10% on property prices.Additionally, the initiative offers flexible mortgage payment plans with better rates from participating banks, making homeownership more affordable. DLD registration fees can also be paid in interest-free instalments, easing the upfront financial burden.So, if you’re eyeing that Dh1 million home, here’s how you can plan your strategy, estimate your costs, and make the most of these benefits to bring your dream of homeownership closer to reality. With this initiative, even moderate-income earners can turn the goal of owning a home into a viable possibility.Let’s say you’re earning Dh18,000 per month, placing you comfortably within the program’s targeted salary range.The First-Time Homeownership Initiative aims to make homeownership a reality for people like you, with homes priced up to Dh1 million eligible under the program. According to the common mortgage lending rule, banks typically recommend that no more than 30% of your monthly income should go towards housing costs (including both the mortgage repayment and associated property costs like maintenance and insurance).Here’s how we calculate this:Now, let’s consider the mortgage options available through this program. With 18-year loan tenures on offer, the total amount you can borrow will depend on the interest rate, which is among the lowest available to first-time buyers under this initiative.Now, let’s see how the First-Time Homeownership Initiative supports this.The program offers competitive interest rates, making homeownership more accessible for residents earning Dh15,000 to Dh20,000 per month. While typical mortgage rates in Dubai range from 3.5% to 4.5%, this initiative, backed by major banks and developers, provides below-market financing options. A 3.5% interest rate is realistic and competitive, ensuring affordable monthly payments for first-time buyers in the mid-income range.Assuming an interest rate of 3.5%, which is reasonable given the program's supportive nature, here’s how the numbers break down for a Dh1,000,000 home:Using the standard mortgage calculation formula, the estimated monthly payment comes out to be around Dh5,544 (precise), which is just slightly above the 30% salary rule. With Dh18,000 per month in salary, the monthly payment of Dh5,544 still remains manageable, offering a solid financial foundation for first-time buyers.While the program offers numerous benefits, it’s important to keep in mind the upfront costs, including the down payment and closing costs. As is typical in Dubai’s property market, you will generally need to make a 20% down payment on the purchase price. In case this requirement remains 20%, even with the initiative's benefits, we've used this figure for a safe estimate. For a Dh1,000,000 property, this means a Dh200,000 down payment.If you're able to make the upfront payment of Dh200,000, your loan amount will reduce to Dh700,000, bringing the monthly payment down to approximately Dh4,314 per month.Though the down payment may seem steep, there are several ways to manage this:To make the most of the First-Time Homeownership Initiative, consider these tips:","Dubai's new first-time homeownership initiative aims to make homeownership accessible to first-time buyers.

Planning for Growth: Infrastructure and Technology in Sync

The Push for Non-Road-Based Mass Transit

Comparisons with Other Emirates





As Abu Dhabi’s population is projected to rise to 5.4 million by 2040, concerns about potential traffic chaos might seem inevitable. However, transport experts say the emirate has not only prepared for this growth but could actually see less traffic congestion over time, thanks to its proactive planning.Speaking to local media outlet Khaleej Times, Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, offered an optimistic outlook. According to Edelmann, Abu Dhabi has demonstrated “a very, very good understanding of how to deal with increased traffic, which is a consequence of increased population.”He pointed to global congestion ranking data released in January by INRIX, a traffic analytics company, which supports this view. The report revealed that in 2023, the average driver in Abu Dhabi spent just 19 hours in traffic for the entire year, making it one of the least congested cities worldwide. In comparison, drivers in Dubai spent 71 hours in traffic over the same period.“So, Abu Dhabi is doing a great job so far,” he said.Edelmann explained that congestion is not just an urban problem, it’s a measurable outcome of urban planning, and Abu Dhabi has consistently proven itself capable of aligning infrastructure growth with future demand.“They will align the efforts of growing the road infrastructure, of growing the technology that’s applied. They have proven that in the past, they will continue doing that,” he said.A key part of Abu Dhabi’s strategy is the integration of smart technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in urban planning. By running AI-powered simulations, planners can predict where new housing will be built and how that will impact traffic flow.“Artificial intelligence in this context certainly plays a big role in urban planning,” Edelmann noted. “So, simulations will be run to understand where the emirate will build and expand the housing infrastructure. And as a consequence, traffic streams will be basically showcased, and they will be taken into consideration to plan and expand the existing road infrastructure.”While the current system performs well, public appetite for mass transportation that doesn’t depend on roads is growing rapidly.“The ongoing expansion of the public transportation system, the public mass transportation system, which ideally should not be road-bound, is on top of the wish list of the UAE road users,” Edelmann explained.Commuters are increasingly looking for rail-bound options such as metros and trains to ease road traffic. Although Abu Dhabi does not currently have a metro system, there have been previous discussions about introducing rail services that would complement its existing bus and taxi network.This ambition aligns with the broader UAE vision of reducing car dependency and investing in sustainable and efficient public transit options.While Dubai and Sharjah often make headlines for traffic issues, Edelmann believes Abu Dhabi stands apart.“Abu Dhabi is blessed in a way. We have data that was published not so long ago about the traffic. It is one of the safest capital cities in the world. You know the bottlenecks in the UAE, and Abu Dhabi is not one of them. So, I don't foresee any impact,” he said.He concluded with a firm endorsement of the emirate’s transport management:“It is very fair to assume that they will be on top of developments. I think there's a very strong message of the Abu Dhabi authorities really having a very, very good grip of what's happening, what has happened in the past and also in the future.”","Abu dhabi’s population is projected to rise to 5.4 million by 2040.

As Soham Parekh emerged as the 'Me Too' moment for US tech world, a US-based Indian-origin entrepreneur, Pritika Mehta, broke down the mystery and decided that the truth of Soham Parekh was pretty simple. Paresk cleared interviews as he was good with that, then he had junior people working for him like a small dev shop.The curious case of Soham Parekh broke the Internet after a US-based AI founder, Suhail Doshi, outed him on X claiming that Parekh has been moonlighting for years, which means he has been working for several software companies at the same time, and he is not even in the US. His resume went viral though his credentials are now disputed as he has been accused of fraud.Another Indian-origin CEO Mihir Deo said Soham Parekh;s story did not surprise him at all. ""That's just how it goes with a lot of the Indian engineering market, straight up. Some people are shocked by this, but if there's anyone who knows the Indian engineering market, the Soham Parekh stuff is like: ""yeah, of course they do that"","" he wrote.""I explored starting a business in India in the past. But the lack of trust that I had in people dissuaded me.People overpromise (and aren't afraid of overpromising) and often stab you in the back to get their lunch. It's a dog eat dog world out there. I decided against starting a company in India because I determined I wasn't thick skinned enough (e.g. also too rigorously honest as well) to play that game,"" Mihir Deo wrote.While US tech workers have been complaining about Indians eating up their jobs, the news of one Indian taking so many jobs in the US raised questions over the hiring and the management of these startups.Tech influencer Deedy Das suggested Parekh is “just the tip of the iceberg,” pointing to a broader trend of “overemployment” in remote work, with a Reddit community discussing similar cases.","Soham parekh's resume went viral after a us-based ai founder, suhail doshi, outed him on x. indian-origin entrepreneur, pritika mehta, broke down the mystery and decided that the truth was pretty simple.
