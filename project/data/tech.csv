Elon Musk's X sues Centre for using IT Act to 'block' content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elon-musks-x-sues-centre-for-using-it-act-to-block-content/articleshow/119250608.cms,"Elon Musk (File photo)

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to the news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny. The lawsuit claims this is yet another government attempt to regulate online discourse without judicial oversight.","Elon musk-owned x filed a case against the central government on thursday for allegedly using the it act to block content on the micro-blogging site.

A notable absence from Meghan Markle 's Netflix programme was observed as her long-standing friend and Soho House founder Markus Anderson did not make an appearance. Anderson, previously described as the ""second most important man in her life"", has been a significant figure in her social circle.Anderson and the Duchess of Sussex developed their friendship during her time in Toronto whilst she filmed Suits. Although he wasn't responsible for introducing her to Prince Harry , he facilitated their relationship by arranging private meetings at Soho House and coordinating a visit to Babington House in Somerset.Their close relationship was evident through his attendance at her royal wedding and her previous blog posts on The Tig, where she referred to him as ""my loving, supportive, and endlessly fun friend"". Despite other friends such as Abigail Spencer and Delfina Blaquier appearing in With Love, Meghan, Anderson was conspicuously absent. Their last public sighting together was at a friend's baby shower in December.The Daily Mail reported that Anderson's absence from the show is attributed to his extensive business travel commitments. A source indicated that he prefers to avoid publicity, stating: ""He just really is not comfortable in the spotlight... it's not his thing.""Despite receiving harsh critiques, Meghan's Netflix programme is scheduled for a second series later this year. The show, With Love, Meghan, was considered crucial for the Sussexes' Netflix partnership, established in 2020. Their most impactful production remains their Harry & Meghan documentary, which included contentious claims about the royal family.Netflix chief Ted Sarandos recently defended Meghan in an interview with Variety. The 60-year-old executive highlighted her cultural impact, noting how the Harry and Meghan trailer sparked extensive media analysis. He mentioned the immediate sell-out of her featured clothing and accessories, including a Hermes blanket.Meghan is set to launch a new podcast titled Confessions of a Female Founder. On Instagram, she expressed enthusiasm about the project, describing it as ""candid conversations"" with ""amazing women"" about their business journeys. She shared that recording was both ""eye-opening, inspiring...and fun!"" and mentioned incorporating these insights into her own business ventures.","Markus anderson did not make an appearance in with love, meghan.

How You Can Protect Yourself from Toll Scam Messages

Stay ahead of scammers with these precautions:

There has been a barrage of unsolicited text messages flooding Americans’ phones in recent months, falsely claiming they owe unpaid tolls and E-ZPass bills. Experts speaking to NBC News reveal this is the work of a sophisticated online syndicate of Chinese-speaking scammers . These criminals sell cybercrime kits on Telegram, designed to steal credit card details and personal information. The scam typically involves a text stating the recipient missed a toll payment, owes a small fee that could increase if unpaid, and includes a link to a fraudulent payment site. Authorities in states like New York, Virginia, Maryland, and Indiana have issued warnings, while the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center has logged over 60,000 reports of this scam. Despite the scale, U.S. officials have not pinpointed the source, with some, like Jennifer Givner of the New York State Thruway Authority, admitting they’re unsure who’s behind it, only that it’s persistent and evolving.Smishing, short for SMS phishing, uses fake text messages to trick people into believing they owe toll fees. These texts often link to counterfeit payment portals that appear legitimate. Clicking the link and entering personal details can lead to financial loss, malware installation, or identity theft. The danger lies in their sophistication—scammers replicate official toll agency branding, use urgent wording like ""Pay now or face penalties,"" and even spoof phone numbers to seem authentic.The toll scam has exploded, with federal agencies like the FTC and FBI raising alarms. Reports of these fraudulent messages have spiked since early 2024. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) notes that the 60,000+ complaints likely underrepresent the issue, as many victims don’t report small losses or fail to recognize the scam. Cybersecurity experts suggest the true number of affected people could be far higher.* Digital Tolling Systems Dominate: Cash toll booths are fading, and digital payments are now the norm in many states.* Trust in Mobile Transactions: People increasingly manage finances via phones, making them more receptive to urgent toll alerts.* Refined Scammer Tactics: Organized crime groups send mass messages from international numbers, complicating efforts to trace them.* Using Real Agency Names: They reference familiar brands like E-ZPass or SunPass.* Crafting Near-Identical URLs: Bogus sites mimic official ones, often with subtle differences like an extra letter.* Creating Urgency: Phrases like ""Final Notice!"" or ""Act now to avoid fines"" pressure victims into quick action.* Avoid Clicking Links: This prevents malware or data theft.* Verify Directly: Visit your toll agency’s official website to check your account.* Report It: Send the text to 7726 (SPAM) and report it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.* Block the Sender: Stop further messages by blocking the number.Enable Spam Filters: Use your phone’s built-in tools to block suspicious texts.","Smishing, short for sms phishing, uses fake text messages to trick people into believing they owe toll fees.

""Smart Indian-American children, whose parents work in engineering or tech, are moving to High Finance. This mirrors what smart Americans have done for well over a generation -when I got my PhD from Princeton in 1994, a former engineer from silicon valley, who moved to a Wall Street job, tried to persuade me to join their quantitative analysis and trading team and I instead took a lower paying job as an engineer at Qualcomm. I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing - probably my father's admonition from childhood.

Recently I have noticed that smart well-educated Indians are gravitating to Finance. This is not good.

We need to apply our talents to solve hard engineering and tech problems, hard urban and rural infrastructure problems, hard health care problems and so on.

Making money on money feels easy but a finance-driven economy would destroy society. This is ancient wisdom, and we must pay heed.""

‘Wise advice…’ commented users

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has a word of caution for the children of Indian-Americans working in the technology industry. In a post on Twitter, Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance, warning of the risks of an economy overly dependent on financial systems. Vembu said that he has observed a growing shift among Indian-American youth, particularly those from engineering or tech backgrounds, towards high finance—echoing a pattern seen in the United States for decades.Drawing from his own life, he shared how he was once encouraged to join a Wall Street trading team after earning his PhD from Princeton in 1994 but opted for a lower-paying engineering role at Qualcomm instead. ""I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing—probably my father's admonition from childhood,"" he noted.He expressed concern that educated and talented individuals are increasingly choosing finance over sectors like technology, infrastructure, and healthcare, where their skills could have a more tangible and positive impact on society. ""Making money on money feels easy, but a finance-driven economy would destroy society,"" Vembu cautioned, adding that this is ""ancient wisdom"" that should not be ignored.The post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in discussions about the implications of finance-centric policies on societal well-being. “Basically, the essence of engineering in engineers must not fade. Wise advice ! But for grads with liabilities like 1st house, car, & marriage, how do they prioritize their love for engineering over higher-paying jobs? Not yet in college but would love to know your view,” commented one user.“Completely agree with the sentiment. Unfortunately solving hard engineering problems doesn’t pay high money. Something we’ll have to look at the incentives and compensation structures and the ecosystem. Ppl shouldn’t find it an aversion as they have to go through hoops to get the resources to work in hard engg problems. Some abundance mindset needed by capital allocators,” said another user.","Sridhar vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'smart indian-american children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance.

"Ancient Europeans had dark skin until 3,000 years ago: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ancient-europeans-had-dark-skin-until-3000-years-ago-study/articleshow/119254233.cms,"AI generated image

Inference of Human Pigmentation from Ancient DNA by Genotype Likelihood

A DNA study has challenged long-held beliefs about the skin colour of early Europeans, revealing that dark skin was widespread across the continent for far longer than previously thought.The study examined 348 ancient human genomes from individuals who lived between 45,000 and 1,700 years ago, was conducted by researchers at the University of Ferrara in Italy.The study titled """" was conducted by Silvia Perretti, Maria Teresa Vizzari, Patrícia Santos, Enrico Tassani, Andrecite Thema Benazzo, Silvia Ghirotto, and Guido Barbujani.The results of the study show that pale skin did not become common among Europeans until around 3,000 years ago, during the Iron Age. While some genetic traits linked to lighter skin began to emerge around 14,000 years ago, the transition to pale skin was much slower than anticipated, published in Archaeology News Online Magazine.One of the most striking revelations of the study is that for much of the time period covered by the DNA samples, around 63% of ancient Europeans had dark skin, while only 8% had light skin.Even during the Copper and Iron Ages, which spanned from 5,000 to 3,000 years ago, half of the individuals examined still had dark or intermediate skin tones. This gradual shift suggests that lighter skin may not have offered immediate survival advantages, as previously believed.The findings also cast doubt on the traditional theory that Europeans quickly developed lighter skin after migrating from Africa.According to the study's lead researchers, geneticist Guido Barbujani and evolutionary biologist Silvia Ghirotto, early European hunter-gatherers maintained dark skin for tens of thousands of years.While UV light, necessary for vitamin D production, tends to be less intense in northern regions, early Europeans likely obtained sufficient vitamin D from their diets, which could explain why dark skin persisted for so long.In addition, anthropologist Nina Jablonski from Pennsylvania State University pointed out that the rise of agriculture, beginning around 10,000 years ago, may have contributed to the prevalence of lighter skin. As farming communities consumed fewer foods rich in vitamin D, the ability to synthesize it through lighter skin may have provided a survival advantage.Forensic techniques were used to reconstruct physical characteristics and extract DNA from ancient bones and teeth. The results revealed that nearly all Europeans had dark skin during the Paleolithic period (45,000 to 13,000 years ago). However, in the Mesolithic period, which began around 13,000 years ago, the first signs of lighter skin and blue eyes appeared in certain regions, notably Northern Europe.Among the most interesting findings was the discovery of a 12,000-year-old Swedish hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes. This raised the possibility that eye colour could have evolved independently of skin pigmentation. Additionally, Ötzi the Iceman, who lived about 5,300 years ago, was found to have darker skin than modern Southern Europeans.During the Bronze Age (approximately 4,000–3,000 years ago), the study noted a significant rise in lighter skin tones. Individuals from areas such as England, Hungary, Estonia, and the Czech Republic exhibited a combination of light skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair.One of the study's key findings is that the transition from dark to light skin was neither linear nor uniform across Europe. The researchers also proposed that some Neanderthals may have had pale skin before modern humans arrived in Europe, suggesting that skin pigmentation evolved in a more complex manner than previously believed. While lighter skin offered an advantage in vitamin D synthesis, other factors, including sexual selection and genetic drift, likely played a role in the development of traits such as blonde hair and blue eyes.","Study examined 348 ancient human genomes from individuals who lived between 45,000 and 1,700 years ago.

Jameis Winston joins the New York Giants: What it means for the Quarterback room



What Winston brings to the Giants



What this means for Aaron Rodgers and the Giants



The New York Giants have made a significant move at the quarterback position, though it may not be the one many anticipated. The team has secured the services of veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million, as reported by NFL Media. Winston himself confirmed the signing on social media, signaling a fresh chapter in his career with Big Blue. However, the signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the Giants' long-term plans at quarterback and how this impacts their potential pursuit of Aaron Rodgers.While adding Winston provides the Giants with much-needed experience under center, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks. NFL Media has indicated that New York remains open to acquiring additional talent, whether through free agency—where Rodgers is still available—or via the upcoming NFL Draft, where Shedeur Sanders is a strong candidate for the No. 3 overall pick.If the Giants do decide to draft a quarterback, Winston could serve as a transitional figure, helping to mentor a rookie and providing a stabilizing presence as they adjust to the NFL. This signing also reflects the Giants' ongoing search for a veteran signal-caller after missing out on other targets, such as Matthew Stafford, who opted to stay with the Los Angeles Rams.Despite Winston’s experience, his contract suggests that he is not necessarily being viewed as the long-term solution. At $8 million over two years, the financial commitment is relatively modest, positioning him more as a bridge quarterback rather than the definitive starter. Before this signing, Tommy DeVito was the only quarterback on the Giants’ roster, highlighting the team’s urgent need for additional depth at the position.Winston, 31, brings a wealth of experience to the Giants' locker room. Having entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he has started 87 regular-season games throughout his career. His career statistics include 24,225 passing yards, 154 touchdowns, and 111 interceptions, with an 86.4 passer rating. Last season, Winston made seven starts for the Cleveland Browns, where he completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,121 yards, throwing 13 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.His experience as a starter makes him a viable short-term option for the Giants, particularly if they draft a young quarterback. While he may not possess the same ceiling as elite quarterbacks, his presence ensures the team has a competent signal-caller who can step in and lead the offense if needed.The timing of Winston’s signing is particularly interesting, as it coincided with Aaron Rodgers’ visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Giants have long been rumored as a potential destination for Rodgers, and some speculated that bringing in Winston might signal a shift away from those plans. However, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Winston’s signing does not affect the Giants' pursuit of Rodgers. ""Winston is nothing more than a veteran for the QB room,"" Breer reported, emphasizing that the team’s interest in Rodgers remains unchanged.Rodgers, who remains the highest-profile quarterback on the free-agent market, left his visit with the Steelers without a deal. That leaves open the possibility that New York could still make a push for him. If the Giants were to sign Rodgers, it would likely alter their draft strategy, making it less urgent to select a quarterback early.Alternatively, if the Giants opt not to sign Rodgers, Winston could hold the starting job temporarily while a rookie quarterback develops. This approach aligns with how other teams have managed young signal-callers, easing them into the starting role rather than throwing them into the fire immediately.The signing of Jameis Winston provides the New York Giants with a veteran presence at quarterback, but it does not offer a definitive answer to the team’s long-term plans. While Winston is a capable starter with extensive experience, his arrival does not rule out the possibility of adding another quarterback, either through free agency or the draft.Also Read: ""Because I caught it early, we were able to treat it”: Erin Andrews encourages regular doctor visits after cervical cancer battle With Rodgers still available and the Giants holding the No. 3 pick in the upcoming draft, the quarterback landscape in New York remains fluid. Whether Winston ultimately becomes the starter or serves as a mentor for a young quarterback, his presence ensures that the Giants are better prepared at the position heading into the 2025 season. However, until Rodgers makes a decision or the Giants finalize their draft-day plans, the question remains: who will be leading the team under center when the season kicks off?","The new york giants have signed veteran quarterback jameis winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million. The signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the giants' long-term plans at quarterback. While adding winston provides the giants with much-needed experience, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119326774,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.

Boeing lays off up to 180 at engineering unit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boeing-lays-off-up-to-180-at-engg-unit/articleshow/119318281.cms,"NEW DELHI: Boeing has laid off up to 180 employees at the Boeing India Engineering Technology Center (BIETC) in Bengaluru as part of the global downsizing being undertaken by the troubled American aerospace major. Boeing senior VP & president of Boeing Global, Dr Brendan Nelson, has confirmed this to TOI.“We are right sizing the company. As part of that, 150-180 Boeing employees in India (have been laid off),” he said. It is learnt that of the 7,000 employees Boeing in India, almost 6,500 are at BIETC in Bengaluru and Chennai. The centres in these two metros “undertake complex advanced aerospace work and support Boeing’s global engineering growth,” says the company’s website. Boeing’s wholly owned engineering and technology campus in Bengaluru, one of the largest Boeing investments outside the US, had opened in Jan 2024.“Because we're downsizing, our total workforce (globally comprising 47 nationalities) is going to 162,000. About 15% of our workforce is outside the United States, which has the largest number of employees. So we've got about 24,000 employees outside the US and more than a quarter of those are in India. We've got 7,000 Indian employees here in the country and this is the biggest footprint that we have outside the US,” Nelson, a former politician who was Australia’s defence minister about two decades back, said, adding, “Combining the 7,000 employees with our about 320 supply chain partners, the total employee count in India is 14,000.”“The company overall downsized 10%. So that's about 17,000 employees across the entire company that have worked very hard. And the reason for that is because we've got to have the right size for the company, to make sure it's consistent with the financial and economic challenges that we face as we come out of that. There has been a reduction in the Indian workforce,” Nelson said.Boeing says India is key to its revival plans and that sourcing from here will increase as aircraft production goes up — something that airline customers like Air India Group and Akasa are keenly awaiting as they are not getting planes at the promised pace. As production picks up pace, the headcount may hopefully go up again. Kelly Ortberg, who took over as Boeing president & CEO last August when the company was in a freefall, has set “execution of delivery; of stabilising the company, whether it’s the balance sheet or the production lines, and then thinking about the future” as his priorities while ensuring safety.“In our very first meeting (with Ortberg), he said, ‘Brendan, I need to go and see what we're doing outside the US’,” Nelson said, who asked him to visit India among the first three countries, with the other two being Australia and Japan. Ortberg was in India on his first overseas trip as Boeing president. “That is a reflection of his commitment to globalising our company and to India specifically. And I said to him after we'd finished the trip in relation to India, ‘is there anything that you're concerned about, anything you think we should be doing, that we're not doing?’ He was most impressed with everything he saw in India, especially the people and the quality & the complexity of the work being done here,” he said.","Boeing has laid off up to 180 employees at the boeing india engineering technology center (bietc) in bengaluru.

The expansion is also poised to have a significant impact on employment, with startups contributing to both direct and indirect job creation across key sectors..The report added the startup ecosystem is projected to create 50 million jobs by 2030, with startups driving a surge in both direct employment and the gig economy. Of these, 4-5 million will be direct white-collar jobs, another 9-10 million in the gig economy, and 35-40 million indirect jobs across sectors. ""A significant portion of these jobs will emerge from newer startups rather than just expansion in existing companies. As India moves from 120 unicorns today to an expected 280 by 2030, most of the employment growth will come from companies that are scaling up rapidly in emerging sectors like AI, SaaS, clean tech, and fintech,"" Rohit Srivastava, senior partner, Longhouse said.The report also highlighted a fundamental shift in the startup founder demographic. Between 2020 and 2024, 40% of unicorn founders had 10-15 years of prior work experience, up from 26% in the 2008-2013 period. Additionally, 55% of unicorn founders held leadership roles before launching their ventures, underscoring the increasing role of domain expertise and industry networks in creating a successful business.The share of unicorn founders with over 20 years of experience also peaked at 30% in recent years, signalling a move towards seasoned entrepreneurs replacing the younger, early-stage founders who once dominated India's startup boom.""Founders today are entering entrepreneurship with deeper industry expertise. The days of fresh-out-of-college unicorn builder are giving way to more seasoned cohort,"" Srivastava added.The study pointed to key industry trends shaping the future of startup landscape. While fintech and enterprise tech continue to dominate the list, AI-led innovation, deeptech, and sustainability-focused startups are gaining investor interest. AI is expected to drive growth across sectors, not only through new startups but also by transforming existing businesses. SaaS is emerging as a strong contender, with more Indian startups scaling into global markets.""AI is both job creator and disruptor. While automation may replace certain routine jobs, it is opening new opportunities in AI development, enterprise transformation, and specialised services.

Tesla has issued a recall for nearly all Cybertrucks on the road due to a potential safety hazard involving an exterior panel that can detach while driving.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced on Thursday that more than 46,000 Cybertrucks, covering model years 2024 and 2025, are affected by the recall, which marks the eighth for the vehicle since deliveries began in late 2023.As per the news agency AP, the issue involves a stainless-steel panel known as the cant rail assembly, located between the windshield and the roof on both sides. The panel is attached using a structural adhesive, which the NHTSA found to be vulnerable to “environmental embrittlement.”If the panel comes loose while the vehicle is in motion, it could pose a serious hazard to other drivers, increasing the risk of collisions. Tesla will offer a free fix by replacing the adhesive with a more durable version and adding reinforcements.Tesla became aware of the defect in early 2025 and has since received at least 151 warranty claims potentially linked to the issue, according to a report filed with the NHTSA. However, the company has stated that it is ""not aware of any collisions, fatalities, or injuries that are or may be related to the condition,"" as reported by The New York Times.Tesla owners will be notified by mail starting May 19, and the company has assured them they can continue driving their Cybertrucks until they receive a service appointment for the necessary repairs.Meanwhile, videos have gone viral on social media showing people easily pulling the panels off Cybertrucks with their hands, drawing further criticism of the vehicle’s design.The recall is the latest setback for Tesla, which has faced multiple safety issues with the Cybertruck. In the past 15 months, the vehicle has been recalled for problems including a stuck accelerator pedal, loss of drive power, and faulty windshield wipers.Tesla previously recalled the Cybertruck in November 2024 due to an electric inverter issue that could cause the wheels to lose power.Beyond the recall, Tesla has been struggling with declining stock value and increased scrutiny over its CEO Elon Musk’s involvement in government policy.According to The New York Times, Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly 42% this year, driven partly by backlash over Musk’s role in federal spending cuts under the Trump administration. Some Tesla owners have responded by selling their vehicles, while others have engaged in more extreme protests, such as vandalising Tesla cars and showrooms.As per AP, recent attacks on Tesla properties have included Molotov cocktails thrown at dealerships and charging stations being set on fire.In Colorado, a woman was charged last month for allegedly attacking Tesla dealerships, while in South Carolina, a man was arrested for setting fire to Tesla charging stations.","Tesla recalls over 46,000 cybertrucks over safety risk as panel detachments raise concerns.
