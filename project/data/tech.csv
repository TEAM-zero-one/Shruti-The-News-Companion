NEW DELHI: In a significant effort to speed up diagnosis of serious infections - a move that experts say could also help reduce unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and mitigate the risk of anti-microbial resistance - Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test capable of detecting multiple infections simultaneously.Patients arriving at hospitals with fever, breathlessness or severe illness are often subjected to a cascade of tests - dengue, influenza, Covid and typhoid - as doctors rule out infections one by one. Each negative report delays diagnosis and treatment, sometimes with serious consequences.To change this, ICMR has drawn up a plan to develop multiplex molecular diagnostic tests that can identify several infections in a single run, sharply cutting diagnostic delays and improving clinical decision-making.Currently, hospitals rely largely on symptom-based provisional diagnosis. ""Once a patient comes to a hospital with a suspected infectious cause, samples are sent for testing based on the provisional diagnosis,"" said Dr Hitender Gautam, professor of microbiology at AIIMS. ""If the test is positive, definitive diagnosis is made and treatment started. But if it is negative, testing for other pathogens follows - and this often leads to delay in diagnosis and delay in correct treatment. ""ICMR has flagged that this step-by-step approach not only raises costs, but also risks missing the actual cause, as many infections present with overlapping symptoms. The planned single-test model is intended to screen for priority pathogens in one go, allowing clinicians to move faster from suspicion to confirmation.The diagnostic delays have wider clinical consequences. While test results are awaited, doctors often initiate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. ""Empirical antibiotic therapy is started during the provisional diagnosis phase and broadly covers many microorganisms,"" Gautam said. ""If this continues for long without a positive report, it increases the chances of antimicrobial resistance,"" he said.Concerns over this trend are reflected in the ICMR-Antimicrobial Resistance Research & Surveillance Network (AMRSN) annual report 2024, which shows that several routinely used antibiotics are rapidly losing effectiveness against bacteria most frequently isolated from hospitals.Faster, syndrome-based diagnosis could help reverse this pattern by enabling an early shift to targeted therapy, which carries a much lower risk of resistance. ICMR has also linked quicker diagnosis to stronger outbreak surveillance, citing lessons from Covid, when delayed detection allowed early silent transmission.The proposed tests will be tailored to India's disease burden, using national surveillance data. ICMR will support Indian manufacturers and research institutions to develop, validate and scale up these kits, including rapid production during outbreaks and future pandemics. Proposals are due by Jan 25.","Indian council of medical research (icmr) has moved to develop a single diagnostic test capable of detecting multiple infections simultaneously.

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from swiss pharma major novartis.

Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner's net worth stability and diversification from 2021 to 2026

The husband-wife duo of Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner leveraged their combined wealth through Stoner's championship-caliber MotoGP career and deliberately kept the majority of their finances private following Casey's retirement. The couple’s combined net worth in 2026 is estimated between $20 and $25 million based on their reported racing salaries, championship bonus payments, and endorsement deals, as well as Casey's post-retirement roles. As the couple has not disclosed precise numbers for many reasons, including privacy concerns, the estimated amounts are purely industry estimates.According to MotoGP official profiles, Casey Stoner's early retirement from MotoGP is one of the primary influences on how he and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner have maintained and increased their wealth. They prioritized long-term stability over continued exposure in commercial ventures.According to Forbes Australia's athlete earnings coverage , the couple had an estimated combined net worth of between $18 and $20 million by 2016. As a result of Casey's championship-winning seasons with Ducati and Honda, he was able to sign multi-million dollar contracts annually and received performance bonuses.Adriana's role as a stay-at-home mother and their mutual reluctance to pursue any high-visibility endorsement opportunities resulted in only certain limited commercially available products being endorsed by the couple's names.Their ultimate source of supplemental income included a few ambassador positions, limited media appearances, and manufacturer relationships. This allowed them to continue to maintain the value of their current position, but without aggressive growth.Between 2021 and 2023, Casey Stoner continued to maintain a selective involvement in motorsport through ambassador positions, casual media appearances, and consulting. According to Motorsport.com , by managing previous income, they have kept their estimated combined net worth between $20 and $22 million over this time period.Casey and Adriana's financial situation was stable from 2024 to 2026, rather than explosive. According to Idol Net Worth, the financial analysts project the couple's total combined net worth to be between $20 and $25 million in 2026. Therefore, while they have not obtained competitive new contract earnings through their respective careers, their continued commitment to the professions and the preservation of previous income has resulted in maintaining their current financial status quo, with modest post-retirement income.The financial history of Casey Stoner and Adriana Tuchyna Stoner illustrates a unique story in elite sport of an athlete followed by the intention to withdraw from the public eye, with a commitment to family, health, and long-term financial security, rather than increasing commercial success post-retirement.Also Read: Casey Stoner was bewildered by the marshalls who stopped him from rejoining the German MotoGP race after a last-lap crash","The husband-wife duo of casey stoner and adriana tuchyna stoner leveraged their combined wealth through stoner's championship-caliber motogp career.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon musk, tesla, spacex, and x’s ceo, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

Chase Carter’s Role in the Spotlight

Fan Reaction and What Comes Next

Cody Bellinger’s free agency has dragged into mid-January, and with little public movement from teams, fans have been searching for signs that something is finally happening. That sign, at least for many, came from Instagram rather than a front office update.Bellinger’s wife, Chase Carter, posted a short story that quickly caught attention. The timing, paired with stalled talks between Bellinger and the New York Yankees, was enough to spark fresh speculation across MLB circles.Chase Carter shared a photo of herself and Cody Bellinger raising their glasses together. The caption read, “My dry January has turned into a very, very wet January.”On its own, the line looks like a joke about giving up the popular no-alcohol challenge. Fans, however, quickly read into it. Many took “very, very wet January” as a hint that something has changed behind the scenes, possibly related to Bellinger’s contract talks.This is not the first time social media activity connected to Bellinger’s personal life has fueled rumors. Similar posts in the past led to speculation about interest from other teams, keeping fans alert to even the smallest clues.Cody Bellinger remains unsigned after turning down the Yankees’ most recent offer.That proposal was reportedly a five-year deal worth more than $30 million per season. While strong, it did not meet what Bellinger’s camp is aiming for in either length or annual value, with expectations closer to a longer deal in the $36-37 million range.There is still interest on both sides. Meetings have taken place, and the Yankees continue to view Bellinger as a key addition to their outfield. Even so, the former Chicago Cubs standout remains without a team as January moves on.Chase Carter, a model, has been open about the difficult start to her career, including early rejections from agencies that criticized her appearance when she was just 13. She met Bellinger in 2020, the couple got engaged in 2023, and they are now married.They share two daughters, Caiden, born in 2021, and Cy, born in 2023. As Bellinger’s free agency continues, Carter’s online presence has added a personal angle to an otherwise quiet and tense negotiation period.Yankees fans have reacted with a mix of hope and impatience, with many calling for a deal to be completed before spring training. Media coverage has focused on how a single Instagram post managed to restart conversation around a stalled situation.For now, nothing has been confirmed. Until a contract is signed, every small detail will continue to be examined. Bellinger’s free agency remains unresolved, and one short caption has become part of the story.","Cody bellinger’s free agency has dragged into mid-january.

Career stability and leadership of Chris Bassitt

Financial growth timeline from 2016 to 2026

Chris Bassitt was never a high draft pick in his career, but he turned his consistent, predictable climb into being a Major League starter at the end of the decade. Bassitt entered pro ball without the hype of a top prospect, but worked his way up through the ranks by being reliable, versatile, and an innings-eater on teams both in transition and in playoff contention.That reliability had secured them financially by the mid 2020s. Across arbitration years, a couple of one-year contracts, and rounding it all out with a big multi-year deal, Bassitt’s arc provides an obvious illustration of how veteran stability and mentorship help generate long-term profits in the modern MLB.A resume for Bassitt that tells the story of a pitcher who survived early career uncertainty and turned into a rotation regular beginning in 2016. He bounced back from Tommy John surgery early in his career and became a reliable workhorse of a starter with Oakland. In New York, that reputation came with him and was a part of a formidable Mets rotation in 2022.Beyond his stats, Bassitt was a clubhouse presence. His preparation and ability to adjust during a game were traits that younger pitchers often mentioned striving to mimic. Those qualities are only becoming more valued by teams, particularly as rotations turn over via injury and untested arms.Bassitt did a lot to reinforce himself as a trusted veteran who would help stabilize pitching staffs during playoff pushes.Bassitt's ascension is also reflected in his financials. His earnings from 2016 to 2020 were relatively modest because he was paid league minimum for most of the time and then saw small raises. His salary soared into the high single-digit millions, a considerable step up for the arbitration years, especially with the Mets.Bang in the middle of his financial timeline was December 2022, when Bassitt inked a three-year, $63 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. It was a deal that was clearly a show of faith in his durability and consistency, and pulled his career earnings into the tens of millions. Most estimates by the mid-2020s have his worth in the low double-digit millions, all guaranteed rather than a risky incentive.Also Read: Teoscar Hernandez net worth timeline (2016 to 2026): How the elite outfielder built his fortune, MLB star","Chris bassitt entered pro ball without the hype of a top prospect.

Budget 2026 expectations: Deloitte calls for customs duty overhaul; seeks higher allocations for exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-deloitte-calls-for-customs-duty-overhaul-seeks-higher-allocations-for-exports/articleshow/126510650.cms,"Representative image

Rationalising import duties and stepping up budgetary allocations in the upcoming Union Budget could give a strong push to domestic manufacturing and exports, Deloitte India said on Tuesday.The consulting firm said the Budget for 2026-27, which is scheduled to be presented on February 1, should build on the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen manufacturing at home and improve India’s export competitiveness.It argued that a more balanced customs duty structure would improve export competitiveness.“A key measure would be to further rationalise the customs duty structure,” said Gulzar Didwania, Partner at Deloitte India, as quoted by news agency PTI.He suggested lowering duties on parts and components in sectors where India has already built adequate manufacturing capacity, while increasing duties on finished goods.According to him, this would discourage imports of fully-made products, promote domestic value addition and create a stronger base for exports.Deloitte also pitched for reforms to the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) regime to improve competitiveness and reduce disputes.These include allowing domestic supplies on a duty-forgone basis, easing sub-contracting rules and exempting value addition from customs duty. The firm also suggested a limited customs amnesty scheme to help cut down litigation, as per PTI.Didwania further said the Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP), which has shown positive results in sectors such as mobile phones and electronics, should be extended to other priority manufacturing areas.He added that higher budgetary support for research and development, along with technology upgradation, would help India move up the value chain and export finished products.The firm also called for higher allocations and an extension of the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme to strengthen export promotion bodies and help Indian exporters expand their presence in global markets.India’s merchandise exports during April–November 2025-26 rose 2.62 per cent to $292.07 billion, while imports increased 5.59 per cent to $515.21 billion, taking the trade deficit to $223.14 billion.",Deloitte: budget for 2026-27 should build on government's efforts to strengthen manufacturing at home.

Nick Fuentes aims to boost presence on Kick with Adin Ross’ help





A controversial online personality, Nick Fuentes, recently made the news for announcing that he wouldthe online streaming platform Kick and even reaching out to popular streamer Adin Ross for help. In a recent online clip going viral on various social media platforms, Fuentes can be spotted proposing his strategy tothe content landscape on the online platform, including potentially getting the help of streamer Adin Ross, who seems to be one of the biggest figures on the online platform.Fuentes has been or had been barred on most major platforms because of his controversial statements and support of extreme ideologies, and there are still efforts to get his views across through other means. Through attacking Kick and trying to connect with Ross, it’s clear that Fuentes plans to get himself a foothold on a platform with many viewers. Ross, with his large number of followers and popular stream views, holds the key to helping Fuentes with his intentions.In the video that went viral, it is evident that the intention of Fuentes is not limited to being featured occasionally on Kick but to become one of the key influential users on the platform. He presented his appeal to Ross as partnering with him in the quest to acquire deals that will boost his presence and impact. From the perspective of Fuentes, by partnering with Ross, he will manage to tap into many people in a short period and establish his presence in the world of controversy that the platform, Kick, represents.Adin Ross’ presence could be the game-changer that Fuentes needs due to the fact that Ross has been hosting Fuentes on his streams before, which generated quite a buzz. Hosting someone on streams has been shown to mean a tremendous amount to the person being hosted, due to the impact they may create. The video has fueled conversation, highlighting the significant role of online influencers in shaping trends.At this stage, it is not known whether Ross plans to cooperate with Fuentes in his activities, but the video has already caused a lot of debate. Many fans are waiting to see what happens in this situation, while others are speculating about what the outcome could mean for Kick’s content. In either event, Ross’s attempt at influence demonstrates how influencers are seeking to influence the sites that feature them.Also Read: Popular hunting YouTuber Ryan Lampers faces felony charges over alleged illegal kills","Nick fuentes, a controversial online personality, recently made the news for announcing that he would be joining the online streaming platform kick.

Budget 2026: COAI seeks cut in telecom licence fee; flags GST burden and ITC pile-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-coai-seeks-cut-in-telecom-licence-fee-flags-gst-burden-and-itc-pile-up/articleshow/126509594.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: ANI)

India’s telecom industry body COAI has asked the government to reduce regulatory levies and ease Goods and Services Tax (GST) norms in the upcoming Union Budget, arguing that high statutory payments continue to strain the sector’s finances.The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), whose members include Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, has proposed lowering the licence fee to 0.5–1 per cent from the current 3 per cent, saying the existing structure places a heavy burden on telecom operators, reported news agency PTI.At present, the licence fee comprises a 3 per cent levy on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), along with a 5 per cent contribution to the Digital Bharat Nidhi.“The licence fee, which is a combination of the licence (three per cent of AGR) and Digital Bharat Nidhi Contribution (five per cent of AGR), is a huge financial burden for the licensed telcos,” COAI said in its submission.The association argued that a reduced levy of 0.5–1 per cent would be sufficient to cover administrative costs.COAI has also urged the Department of Telecommunications to pause further contributions to the Digital Bharat Nidhi until the existing unutilised corpus is fully used.The industry body said such steps would help reduce financial stress and allow operators to invest more in network expansion and next-generation connectivity, in line with the government’s ‘Viksit Bharat’ vision.On GST-related issues, COAI flagged concerns over rising input tax credit (ITC) accumulation in the sector. It recommended a special GST exemption on regulatory payments such as licence fees, spectrum usage charges (SUC), and spectrum acquired through auctions, reported news agency ANI.As an alternative, the association suggested cutting the GST rate under the Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) on these payments to 5 per cent from the current 18 per cent.COAI said this would be revenue-neutral for the government while offering liquidity relief to telecom operators and helping reduce ITC pile-up, as per ANI.COAI director general Lt Gen Dr SP Kochhar said the current levy framework continues to impose a significant financial burden on licensed telecom operators.The association also proposed allowing the use of existing ITC balances to discharge GST liabilities under RCM on licence fees and SUC, a move it said would reduce cash outflows and improve credit utilisation.Emphasising the sector’s wider role, COAI said telecommunications is no longer a standalone vertical but a “horizontal value-added enabler” supporting multiple industries.In this context, it has called for a broader recalibration of spectrum pricing and assignment models to reflect the sector’s strategic importance in India’s digital economy.",The cellular operators association of india (coai) has proposed lowering the licence fee to 0.5–1 per cent from the current 3 per cent.

During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations.

At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-pens-the-year-2026-note-says-thing-i-am-most-upset-about-is-/articleshow/126450754.cms,"Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Here’s Bill Gates annual 2026 letter in full

Optimism with footnotes

As we start 2026, I am thinking about how the year ahead will set us up for the decades to come.

I have always been an optimist. When I founded Microsoft, I believed a digital revolution powered by great software would make the world a better place. When I started the

Gates Foundation

, I saw an opportunity to save and improve millions of lives because critical areas like children’s health were getting so little money.

In both cases, the results exceeded my expectations. We are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago. I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization. My answer is this:

I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.

But these days, my optimism comes with footnotes.

The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under 5 years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.

This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.

The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools. Yet I remain optimistic about the long-term future. As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.

I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.

The key will be, as always, innovation. Consider this: An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence. Today, thanks to revolutionary treatments, a person with HIV can expect to live almost as long as someone without the virus. By the 2040s, new innovations could virtually eliminate deaths from HIV/AIDS.

Budget cuts limit how many people benefit from lifesaving tools, as we saw to devastating effect last year. But nothing can erase the fact that for decades we didn’t know how to save people from HIV, and now we do.

Breakthroughs are a bell that cannot be unrung. They ensure that we will never go back to the world in 2000 where over 10 million children died from preventable causes every year—and they form the core of my optimism about where the world is headed.

But as I mentioned, there are footnotes to my optimism. Although the innovation pipeline sets us up for long-term success, the trajectory of progress hinges on how the world addresses three key questions.

1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?

The “golden rule” precept is more important now than ever with the record disparities in wealth. This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.

Through the Giving Pledge, I get to work with a number of incredible philanthropists who set a great example by giving away substantial portions of their wealth in smart ways. However, more needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

More needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

Turning to aid budgets for poor countries, I am worried about one number: If funding for health decreases by 20 percent, 12 million more children could die by 2045. I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1 percent of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding. The foundation’s Goalkeepers report lays out what is at risk and how the world can best spend the aid it gives.

I will spend much of my year working with partners to advocate for increased funding for the health of the world’s children. I plan to engage with a number of communities, including health care workers, religious groups, and members of diaspora communities to help make this case.

2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?

Some problems require doing far more than just letting market incentives take their course.

The first critical area is climate change. Without a large global carbon tax (which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable), market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions.

Yet only by replacing all emitting activities with cheaper alternatives will we stop the temperature increase. This is why I started Breakthrough Energy 10 years ago and why I will continue to put billions into innovation.

The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40 percent. But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation. Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need.

If we don’t limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world’s poorest people.

Since even in the best case the temperature will continue to go up, we also need to innovate to minimize the negative impacts.

This is called climate adaptation, and a critical example is helping farmers in poor countries with better seeds and better advice so they can grow more even in the face of climate change. Using AI, we will soon be able to provide poor farmers with better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.

The foundation has committed $1.4 billion to supporting farmers on the frontlines of extreme weather.

I will be investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead while also continuing to give more to children’s health, the foundation’s top priority. The need to ensure money is spent on the most important priorities was the topic of a memo I wrote in the fall.

A second critical area where the world must focus on innovation-driven equality is health care.

Concerns about healthcare costs and quality are higher than ever in all countries.

In theory, people should feel optimistic about the state of health care with the incredible pipeline of innovations. For example, a recent breakthrough in diagnosing Alzheimer’s will revolutionize how we test for—and ultimately prevent—this disease, saving billions of dollars in costs. (Funding Alzheimer’s research is a particular focus for me.)

There’s similar progress on obesity and cancer, as well as on problems in developing countries like malaria, TB, and malnutrition.

Despite so much progress, however, the cost and complexity of the system means very few people are satisfied with their care. I believe we can improve health care dramatically in all countries by using AI not only to accelerate the development of innovations but directly in the delivery of health care.

Like many of you, I already use AI to better understand my own health. Just imagine what will be possible as it improves and becomes available for every patient and provider. Always-available, high-quality medical advice will improve medicine by every measure.

We aren’t quite there yet—developers still have work to do on reliability and how we connect the AI to doctors and nurses so they are empowered to check and override the system.

But I’m optimistic we will soon begin to scale access globally. I am following this work so the Gates Foundation and partners can make sure this capability is available in the countries that need it most—where there aren’t enough medical personnel—at the same time it is available elsewhere.

We are already working on pilots and making sure that even relatively uncommon African languages are fully supported.

Governments will have to play a central role in leading the implementation of AI into their health systems.

This is another case where the market alone won’t and can’t provide the solution.

A third and final area I will mention briefly is education. AI gives us a chance for the kind of personalized learning to keep students motivated that we have dreamed of in the past. This is now a focus of the Gates Foundation’s spending on education, and I am hopeful it will be empowering to both teachers and students. I’ve seen this firsthand in New Jersey, and it will be game changing as we scale it for the world.

All three of these areas—climate, health, and education—can improve rapidly with the right government focus. This year I will spend a lot of time meeting with pioneers all over the world to see which countries are doing the best work so we can spread best practices.

3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?

Of all the things humans have ever created, AI will change society the most. It will help solve many of our current problems while also bringing new challenges very different from past innovations.

When people in the AI space predict that AGI or fully humanoid robots will come soon and then those deadlines are missed, it creates the impression that these things will never happen. However, there is no upper limit on how intelligent AIs will get or on how good robots will get, and I believe the advances will not plateau before exceeding human levels.

The two big challenges in the next decade are use of AI by bad actors and disruption to the job market.

Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing. We’ll need to be deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed.

In 2015, I gave a TED talk warning that the world was not ready to handle a pandemic. If we had prepared properly for the Covid pandemic, the amount of human suffering would have been dramatically less. Today, an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon.

We’ll need to be deliberate about how AI is developed, governed, and deployed.

The second challenge is job market disruption. AI capabilities will allow us to make far more goods and services with less labor. In a mathematical sense, we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone. As AI delivers on its potential, we could reduce the work week or even decide there are some areas we don’t want to use AI in.

The effects of this disruption are hard to model. Sometimes, when a game-changing technology improves rapidly, it drives more demand at lower cost and, by making the world richer, increases demand in other areas. For example, AI makes software developers at least twice as efficient, which makes coding cheaper while also creating demand elasticity for code. (Computing is a good historical example where lower costs actually caused the overall market to grow.

)

Even with this complexity, the rate of improvement is already starting to be enough to disrupt job demand in areas like software development. Other areas like warehouse work or phone support are not quite there yet, but once the AIs become more capable, the job disruption will be more immediate.

We’re already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years. Even if the transition takes longer than I expect, we should use 2026 to prepare ourselves for these changes—including which policies will best help spread the wealth and deal with the important role jobs play in our society.

Different political parties will likely suggest different approaches.

By including these footnotes, particularly the last one, some readers may find my continued optimism even more surprising. But as we start 2026, I remain optimistic about the days ahead because of two core human capabilities.

The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other. Throughout history, you can always find stories of people tending not just to themselves or their clan or their country but to the greater good.

Those two qualities—foresight and care—are what give me hope as the year begins. As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has written his annual letter for 2026, expressing a rare and “upsetting” shift in global progress. While maintaining long-term optimism, Gates revealed that a critical metric of human health has moved backward: child mortality. Gates noted that the trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.In his annual letter titled, “Optimism with footnotes”, Gates highlighted that for the first time since 2000, the number of deaths for children under the age of five increased, rising from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025. He also noted that while AI-driven innovation in health and climate is accelerating, the “trajectory of progress” is currently under threat by multiple factors: dwindling generosity, climate and health equality and AI disruptions.Gates remains confident that the “innovation pipeline” will eventually spark a new era of progress.","Gates: i believe the world will keep improving, but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time. Gates: the thing i am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress. Gates: will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126450746,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1409239,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
