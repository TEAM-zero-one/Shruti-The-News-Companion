Daniel Keene, a business owner of Texas, who posted a video of a Ganesh Chaturthi procession and said he wanted to raise his kids in America and not India, had to pay a huge price for his rant which he deleted but refused to apologize. “We have to cancel the H-1Bs. I want my kids to grow up in America. Not India,"" his post, along with the video of the procession, read. It went viral and his family members were subjected to doxxing and threats. He said there was even an extortion attempt from someone claiming to represent millions of Indian-Americans demanding $20,000.His shop Boundaries Coffee received false reviews, his gym canceled his membership and then his church gave him an earful asking him to express repentance for the hateful post; and then removed him.Keene toldthat he does not regret what he posted against Indians, as he claimed that he did not hate Indians. ""It's not about skin color or anything. It's about what kind of country do you want to leave your kids, and do you have the right to object to the policies that are seemingly affecting my children?

I did not want to get death threats,"" he said.Keene said that The Trails Church asked him to leave the congregation after deliberating on the content of his post. He said he was hammered for hours and then asked to apologize for what he said about Indian immigration. Keene said he was ready to put out a post clarifying what he meant or speak with anyone offended but was not ready to take back his words. ""That's the policy position I stand behind,"" he said.The church elders told him that he was on ""the path of discipline"" which means they could remove them from membership if he refused to repent. Keene said it was a serious issue as they thought that he was not a Christian anymore because he did not repent the sin that he claimed he was not clear about.The church authorities toldthat they discussed with Keene on the gospel mandate to ""love our neighbors as Christ has loved his church"" and asked them to consider whether they could joyfully continue as members of the church.

The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders see a life-changing raise after years of fighting for fair pay

The new pay reflects the Cowboys’ brand power and public influence

For decades, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have been known as more than just sideline entertainers, they’ve been cultural icons, ambassadors of the franchise, and symbols of American sports glamour. Now, for the first time in years, their compensation is finally catching up with their star power.After years of discussion about fairness and visibility, members of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders received a staggering 400% pay increase ahead of the 2025 NFL season. While official salary figures remain undisclosed, reports indicate that a veteran cheerleader now earns around $150,000 per year, a major step forward from previous rates. However, despite the raise, the cheerleaders still do not receive health insurance from the team.The news was revealed by team veteran Megan McElaney, a four-year member from Oceanside, California, during the hit Netflix series America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. “Our efforts were heard and they wanted to give us a raise,” McElaney shared. “And we ended up getting a 400% increase, which is like, life-changing.”This raise follows years of gradual advocacy for better pay. Back in 2019, the cheerleaders’ per-game rate doubled from $200 to $400. Former member Kristin Westbrook also shed light on the earlier pay structure, revealing that during her time, cheerleaders earned “$15/hour” for practice, along with “flat fees for appearances – $100 (x # of years on the team).”The Cowboys’ cheerleaders have long been an integral part of the team’s identity, a brand recognized far beyond the gridiron. From global appearances to Halloween costumes inspired by their iconic uniforms, the cheerleaders symbolize both tradition and excellence. Their visibility has only grown with Netflix’s behind-the-scenes docuseries, which gave fans a closer look at the hard work behind the glamour.Also Read: “So embarrassing”: Dallas Cowboys cheerleader sparks viral debate after revealing surprising pom-pom rule behind the glamour While disparities between NFL players and cheerleaders remain, this pay raise marks a major cultural shift.

Friendship whispers resurface after Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

How Travis Kelce fits into Taylor Swift’s redefined circle



As Taylor Swift continues her global domination with The Life of a Showgirl, fans are now shifting their attention from her chart-topping music to her rekindled friendships and perhaps even her relationship balance with NFL star Travis Kelce . The latest whisper comes from Deuxmoi, where insiders claim Swift and her longtime friend Blake Lively may have quietly reunited after months of rumored distance.According to Deuxmoi’s October 9th Deux/U podcast, a discreet source revealed that Taylor Swift and Blake Lively “may have allegedly seen each other in the last few weeks.” The insider described the encounter as “not strained, rather friends just being friends.” The rumor comes months after Lively’s public “It Ends With Us” lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni, which narrowly brushed against Swift’s name.While details remain private, the speculation has sparked excitement among fans who feared the pair’s friendship had fizzled. Observant Swifties also pointed out that Swift was recently spotted wearing a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet—the same one Lively wore to the It Ends With Us London premiere in 2024. Was it a subtle nod of support, or just another of Swift’s famous Easter eggs?Adding another layer, Swift’s track “CANCELLED!” from her new album has stirred conversation for its apparent empathy toward a friend facing public backlash. Many believe the song was inspired by Lively’s experience, a move that would mark Swift’s quiet show of loyalty rather than shade.As Swift navigates her increasingly public relationship with Travis Kelce, some fans wonder whether her time in Kansas City and her global tour life have naturally distanced her from Hollywood friends. Yet, if reports of a Lively-Swift reunion are true, it could signal that the pop star is rebalancing her worlds, one where the NFL and Hollywood coexist peacefully.Also Read: “Shape of a….”: Taylor Swift’s ‘Wood’ sparks chaos as fans uncover steamy new hidden tour detail and Travis Kelce reacts Swift, who is the godmother to Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ children, seems unlikely to let that bond fade completely.

The Donald Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, going beyond the initial shock of the $100,000 fee that is now mandatory for all companies that want to file H-1B petition to hire staff from foreign countries. The proposals, formally listed in the Federal Register under the title of 'Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program' include several technical aspects which will impact the hiring of Indians.Department of Homeland Security, in its proposed draft, said: “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”This modifies the softening that was done by the Biden administration to mean that there must be a logical connection between the degree and job duties. The Trump administration emphasizes direct relation, instead of mere logical connection. This would restrict who can be hired for which role.DHS plans to review and potentially narrow which employers and positions are exempt from the annual cap, affecting nonprofit research organizations, universities, and health care institutions that currently benefit from exemptions, Newsweek reported.Companies that place H-1B workers at other firms’ worksites, a common practice in the technology and consulting sectors, will come under more scrutiny.More scrutiny of companies that previously violated wage or labor condition rules.This may stop employers use the O-1A visas and national interest waivers to hire high-skilled foreign nationals. O-1A visas are for individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry).The visa fee hike threw the IT companies into disarray initially, as companies rushed to call back all H-1Bs to the US. But the administration later clarified that it was for new petitions and now the fee has got legally challenged. Tech startups will have to hire American graduates as they cannot possibly pay $100,000 for foreign hirings but companies like Nvidia will not have much difficulty. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company will keep sponsoring H-1Bs and bear all related costs.","Trump administration is working on new immigration restriction rules.

Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai. Mahindra revealed that he has downloaded the app ‘with pride’.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification. He noted that the working environment such as McDonald’s expose young people to real world challenges such as managing time, dealing with customers and working as part of a team.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

“This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video game pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future,”





GTA 6 is expected to generate more revenue at the standard $70 price point than at a higher $100 price, a new analysis claims. A study by MIDiA Research (seen by IGN) suggests that pricing the highly anticipated game at $100 would deter potential buyers and ultimately result in lower overall earnings for developer Rockstar.said Perry Gresham, co-author of the report and Head of Data at MIDiA Research. “A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table,” he added.The study also indicates that raising the game’s price beyond $70, which it describes as an “optimum” point, could lead to lower revenue due to fewer people buying GTA 6.said co-author and Games Analyst at MIDiA, Brandon Sutton.Sutton added.According to the survey results from over 2,000 US consumers, 60% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase the game at $69.99. To compare, 35% said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy it at $99.99.The study also found that only 16% of consumers would buy the game at $149.99, while 79% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase it at $49.99.Rockstar is expected to announce the game’s official price closer to its release date, which is set for May 26, 2026.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right?

Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm ceo rene haas suggested that intel could face challenges in matching tsmc’s position as a major chip foundry.

Mira Murati’s growing influence in Silicon Valley’s AI ecosystem





Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, Angela Jiang. According to a Business Insider report, Jiang – an early OpenAI product manager has started a startup called Worktrace AI. The publication claims to have reviewed documents which reveal that Worktrace AI was in talks this summer to raise $10 million in seed funding at a $50 million valuation.Jiang, who joined OpenAI as its third product manager, played a key role in developing the GPT models that powered ChatGPT’s viral success in late 2022. She later worked on OpenAI’s policy team before leaving in December 2024.Worktrace AI joins a growing list of startups founded by OpenAI alumni — including Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, and William Fedus’s Periodic Labs — that have quickly attracted billion-dollar valuations before releasing a commercial product.Mira Murati’s involvement in Worktrace AI follows her own major project, Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion in seed funding earlier this year and reached a valuation of $12 billion. Her growing role as a backer of emerging AI companies signals her influence in shaping the next generation of artificial intelligence research and enterprise solutions.Like Murati’s venture, Worktrace AI is focused on bringing advanced automation to large enterprises.According to its website, the company helps businesses “find and automate repetitive tasks by observing employees.”Worktrace AI has attracted funding from several prominent OpenAI figures, including Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT; Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer; and Joanne Jang, who helped define ChatGPT’s behavior, according to a job listing. The company is also backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, along with venture capital firms 8VC and Conviction.Despite having an active website and LinkedIn profile, the company has not made any public announcements about its launch.","Mira murati, former openai chief technology officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (ai) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, angela jiang.

Gen Z pushes back against fast furniture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/gen-z-pushes-back-against-fast-furniture/articleshow/124508006.cms,"DW photo

The rise of fast furniture

Forests under pressure

Gen Z's secondhand surge





Every item of furniture in Daniel Santos' Berlin apartment comes with a story. There's the desk that took him deep into the city's former Soviet suburbs, the bed frame he hauled with the help of five housemates, and the nearly century-old dresser he brought back to life with glue and nails.Santos says it's ""crazy"" to think the pale-yellow antique he bought from a grandson parting with his family's heirlooms ""has survived until now.""""Actually a few days ago, I sent him pictures of it in my room, and he was happy to see that it was living on,"" he said.Santos is part of a younger generation of decor scavengers, increasingly aware of furniture's massive carbon footprint and therefore happy to shop secondhand. They don't want to buy things that will be dumped a little further down the line.Globally, researchers estimate at least 51 million tons of furniture are consumed every year with more than 95% of it discarded. That high buy-to-landfill ratio is partially a consequence of ""fast furniture,"" a cousin of""fast fashion"" — cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability.On the rise in recent years, fast furniture's ever-changing styles encourage people to toss furnishings before the end of their natural lifecycle.One study found that British consumers redecorate their homes every one to five years. In a push to ""to stay in style, they turn to inexpensive and disposable furniture that can easily be replaced when their decor changes,"" the authors wrote.And items are often not made to be recyclable. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs — all fused with laminates, resin and glues — which makes them very hard to separate and repurpose.In the United States alone, 12.1 million tons of furniture waste was generated in 2018 with less than 0.5% of it recycled. That's an almost sixfold increase over 1960 levels.Chicago furniture designer CoCo Ree Lemery says the explosion in fast furniture is partially driven by cheap new materials.IKEA's ubiquitous Billy bookcase is a case in point. When it first appeared in the IKEA catalog in 1979, it was made with a wood veneer finish. Since then, it has been redesigned with contact paper, making it cheaper than the original but harder to repair. Today, the company claims to sell a new Billy bookcase every five seconds.Lemery says the influence of fast-fashion brands on home decor design has been another key factor pushing the uptake of cheap furniture.Spanish fast-fashion giant Zara launched its home division in 2003, followed by Swedish rival H&M in 2009. They both helped normalize quick-turn seasonal trends such as rustic wood tables for fall or velvet chairs for winter in home goods stores.Buying trends shows a greater emphasis on cheap, trendy furniture, Lemery said. ""So, a lot of designers and manufacturers and large companies are in fact following that data, despite it not being good for the long run.""As demand for cheap furniture has increased, it's placed pressure on the supply chain and resources.IKEA is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested for industrial purposes each year, the company said.Environmental group Greenpeace has accused the company of felling ancient forests in areas of Romania's Carpathian Mountains that it says should be protected for their high biodiversity value.The furniture giant told DW it had reviewed the Greenpeace report and could confirm that ""the wood used in IKEA products from these forests fully complies with applicable laws."" And with standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) — a global nonprofit that certifies timber production.""Wood from protected old-growth forests is strictly prohibited in our supply chain,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""Nevertheless, we have asked FSC Romania to consider the potential need for further protection following our review.""Flat-pack giants and fast-fashion retailers may be losing sway with first-time furniture buyers.According to research from e-commerce comparison website Capital One Shopping, over a billion people visit the Facebook Marketplace digital classified service every month. An estimated 491 million buy something there. Meanwhile, a trend report from social media platform Pinterest recently said searches for ""secondhand kitchens"" have skyrocketed by 1,012% and ""secondhand decor"" by 283%, with Gen Z users making up half of the site's base.Deana McDonagh, professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says younger consumers are turning to secondhand shopping for a number of reasons: sustainability, frequent moves, tight budgets, limited transport, and also the emotional connection they form with an acquired piece.""With this old furniture, these old chairs, you have to invest in refreshing it,"" McDonagh said, which draws it into a person's story.Santos can relate to that, insisting he wouldn't dream of dumping the dresser he fixed up.Sustainability advocates say reuse is one of the clearest antidotes to fast furniture's environmental toll.""The more that you can source inside your bubble, the better off you're making the world,"" Lemery said","""fast furniture"" is cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs. Ikea is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124508005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",Eu demands digital giants including snapchat and youtube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.

Building sovereign space capabilities in the UAE

Roadmap for UAE space propulsion: Infrastructure and innovation

Scaling to larger engines for heavier spacecraft and payload missions

Development of regenerative cooling systems for sustained engine performance

Transitioning to cryogenic propellants, a complex but vital technology for deep space operations

UAE joins global league of liquid propulsion nations





In a historic leap for its sovereign space ambitions, the UAE has successfully designed, built, and test-fired its first liquid-fuelled rocket engine. Developed entirely in Abu Dhabi by the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), this 250-newton-class engine marks a crucial step in building the country’s independent space propulsion capability and advancing its roadmap for orbital and deep-space missions.The Technology Innovation Institute (TII), the applied research arm of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council, has announced the successful ignition of the UAE’s first liquid-fuelled rocket engine, a technical and strategic breakthrough in the nation’s expanding space programme.The engine, a 250-newton-class liquid rocket thruster, was completely designed and constructed in the UAE. It is capable of producing a thrust equivalent to lifting 25 kilograms on Earth. Thrusters in this category are primarily used for small satellite propulsion, orbital manoeuvres, and attitude control, all of which are critical for in-space mobility and stability.The engine was tested through over 50 hot-fire firings, reaching 94% combustion efficiency, a benchmark typically associated with well-established global space programmes. These performance metrics validated its design reliability, combustion precision, and consistency, key prerequisites for advanced space missions, including orbital operations, satellite station-keeping, and future lunar and Martian missions.Dr. Najwa Aaraj, CEO of TII, emphasised that the engine’s successful operation is not only a technological achievement but a platform for future capability. “This engine is the foundation for building the capability that will empower the UAE to design, test, and deploy propulsion systems supporting a wide range of future missions,” she said.The Liquid Rocket Engine Programme, spearheaded by TII in Abu Dhabi, was designed with a dual focus: to develop local propulsion technologies and to build a skilled Emirati-led space engineering workforce. Nearly half of the core engineering team behind the engine were Emirati nationals, responsible for critical tasks such as thermal and structural simulations, injector design, and test protocol development.“This is a moment of national pride,” said Dr. Elias Tsoutsanis, Chief Researcher at TII’s Propulsion and Space Research Centre. “It represents the starting point of a broader journey towards an ambitious space future led by the people of the UAE.”Despite the absence of permanent testing infrastructure in the country, the team overcame significant logistical and technical challenges. They custom-built cold-flow testing rigs in Abu Dhabi and collaborated with Airborne Engineering in the UK to conduct the live hot-fire tests.Dr. Tsoutsanis acknowledged the scale of the challenge: “The most significant hurdle was the absence of dedicated test infrastructure in the UAE. We solved this by developing deployable systems and performing the live firings abroad.”Work is now underway to establish the UAE’s first static-fire rocket engine testing facility, which is expected to be operational by 2026 in Abu Dhabi. This facility will be capable of supporting engines up to five times more powerful than the current 250-newton model.The first 1-kilonewton-class engine firing on Emirati soil is also slated for 2026, signalling the UAE’s commitment to bringing space research infrastructure home.TII’s propulsion roadmap includes:“These plans reflect Abu Dhabi’s determination to play a meaningful role in global space exploration,” said Dr. Tsoutsanis. “Our aim is not just to build engines, but to enable the UAE to access space independently, repeatedly, and sustainably.”With this successful milestone, the UAE enters an elite group of countries with verified liquid propulsion design capabilities — including the United States, China, Russia, India, Japan, and members of the European Space Agency.The UAE’s progress showcases not only its technical capability but also its strategic vision to cultivate local expertise, reduce dependence on foreign technologies, and inspire the next generation of Emirati space innovators.For the engineers involved, especially the Emirati team members who grew up watching space launches from afar, this achievement is deeply personal. “Seeing our own design ignite is something we’ll never forget,” said one engineer.“This engine is more than a technical success — it’s the start of a journey,” said Dr. Aaraj. “It reflects the UAE’s evolving capability in space, led by its own people and driven by a long-term vision.”","The 250-newton-class liquid rocket thruster was completely designed and constructed in the uae.

This virtual tracking method eliminates the need for traditional tracks, allowing for greater flexibility in routing and significantly reducing construction time and cost.Originally reviewed on November 3, 2024, by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, the Trackless Tram is a major part of the RTA’s Main Roads Development Plan for 2024–2027. The RTA confirmed that the system is expected to be deployed across eight locations in Dubai, marking a substantial expansion of the emirate’s surface transport capabilities.This fully electric and autonomous tram represents a sustainable alternative to existing modes of transport. It offers a seamless integration with Dubai’s existing smart transport network, which includes the Dubai Metro — one of the world’s most efficient driverless metro systems, and the Dubai Tram, which was the first outside Europe to be powered by a ground-based electric supply.Key specifications of the Trackless Tram:By deploying this tram, RTA aims to not only improve transport efficiency but also make strides in urban sustainability, reduce emissions, and align with the emirate’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2030 — which aims to make Dubai a global model in AI-powered infrastructure.GITEX Global 2025 continues to be a key destination for governments, startups, and corporations showcasing how technology is transforming cities and lives. More than just a tech expo, it’s a platform for exchanging ideas on real-world applications of innovation — from public safety to urban mobility.RTA’s pavilion at GITEX this year reflects this spirit. Beyond the Trackless Tram, the authority is unveiling 11 innovative products and platforms, each aligned with its mission to create an intelligent, integrated, and sustainable transport ecosystem. These projects demonstrate how AI, automation, and smart infrastructure can collectively support Dubai’s ambition to become a globally recognised digital capital.In addition to the Trackless Tram, RTA is showcasing the following key initiatives:","The trackless tram features three carriages, carries up to 300 passengers, operates at speeds up to 70 km/h, and runs on virtual tracks. The world’s first urban aerial taxi, currently in local trials, will cut travel time from dubai international airport to palm jumeirah to just 10 minutes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124499394,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
