Elon Musk’s Tesla robotaxis face federal investigation after dangerous driving videos go viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musks-tesla-robotaxis-face-federal-investigation-after-dangerous-driving-videos-go-viral/articleshow/122068791.cms,"Viral clips of Tesla robotaxis trigger regulatory response

Tesla’s rollout collides with public safety concerns

Experts warn of unpredictable AI behavior

Tesla’s regulatory history raises red flags

Musk’s bold ambitions face growing pressure

What’s next for Tesla’s robotaxi program?

In a major setback to Tesla’s self-driving ambitions, federal regulators have launched an investigation into the company’s newly debuted robotaxis following the circulation of alarming videos online. The footage, captured during the early rollout in Austin, Texas, shows Tesla’s autonomous vehicles veering into opposing lanes, ignoring traffic signals, and braking without reason. These incidents have prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to begin an inquiry. Tesla had just begun offering paid robotaxi rides using its updated Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, but the troubling footage now casts doubt on the safety and reliability of the technology.Videos posted on social media show multiple Tesla vehicles behaving erratically. In one case, a robotaxi is seen making an illegal maneuver from a left-turn-only lane, gliding into oncoming traffic before swerving back. Another clip shows a car braking twice in the middle of the road with no obstacles in sight. These viral incidents prompted NHTSA to issue a statement confirming it is in contact with Tesla and reviewing the events.Tesla began offering its first commercial robotaxi rides in Austin using modified Model Y vehicles. The launch was met with enthusiasm from investors and Tesla loyalists, who hailed it as a major milestone. However, safety experts were quick to raise red flags. Critics argue that despite Tesla’s claims, the FSD software still lacks the consistency and judgment required for public road use.Automotive technology specialist Sam Abuelsamid voiced strong concerns over the system’s performance. “This is not a system that should be carrying members of the public,” he said, citing its tendency to alternate between smooth operation and dangerous unpredictability. While some passengers reported flawless rides, experts stress that even rare errors can have catastrophic consequences.The investigation comes amid a history of regulatory clashes between Tesla and the NHTSA. The agency previously forced the company to recall over 2.4 million vehicles due to safety concerns tied to its FSD technology. This new probe raises further questions about Tesla’s readiness to deploy fully autonomous vehicles without a safety driver onboard.CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised that Tesla’s robotaxis will revolutionize transportation, even suggesting mass deployment as early as next year. However, with competitors like Waymo already operating safer and more controlled autonomous fleets, Tesla’s margin for error is shrinking. The scrutiny now threatens to slow Tesla’s roadmap and put Musk’s aggressive timelines at risk.While Tesla has yet to release an official statement in response to the investigation, NHTSA's involvement signals increased oversight going forward. If the agency determines that the software poses a serious risk, further recalls or restrictions could follow. For now, the future of Tesla’s autonomous driving program may hinge on whether it can convince regulators—and the public—that its vehicles are truly road-ready.",Videos posted on social media show multiple tesla vehicles behaving erratically.

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.","Sundar pichai's iit batchmate gauranga das who turned'monk' looks younger than him; his reason: 'you deal with google, i deal with god' 70% of indian teens spend 7 hours online: iskcon monk warns of mental health fallout.

Deebo’s role solves Washington’s YAC struggles



Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy confidence levels 🧐 | NFL Live

Jayden Daniels already sees explosive potential



The Washington Commanders are reloading with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels at the center of their offensive rebuild — but it’s Deebo Samuel who may quietly become the key. With one of the league’s worst yards-after-catch (YAC) metrics in 2024, Washington needed a dynamic playmaker in space. Samuel’s arrival offers that and more, providing the spark they lacked last season. Now, expectations are soaring for a breakout 2025 tandem.While the Commanders ranked top five in most offensive categories last year, they were shockingly low in one key area — 21st in YAC per reception. NFL analyst Mina Kimes highlighted this flaw and pointed straight to Samuel as the solution. “The Commanders offense was top five in just about every metric last year but one where they were not was yards after the catch per reception,” she said.She followed with a now-viral phrase: “By God, that's Deebo Samuel's music. That's exactly what he's been brought into this offense to do.” Kimes believes Samuel’s unique ability to generate big gains on short throws is exactly what this team lacked. “You can see him certainly taking advantage of that to get them yards after the catch,” she added.Jayden Daniels is fully on board with the vision — and his excitement is crystal clear.When asked about Samuel, the rookie QB didn’t hesitate: “An 80-yard touchdown on a screen — that’s what I see.” Daniels’ quick-passing game aligns perfectly with Deebo’s YAC-heavy style. The chemistry between them is already generating buzz across the league.Kimes also emphasized this synergy: “I think he brings an element to this offense that didn’t exist last year.” With Terry McLaurin stretching the field and Jahan Dotson creating separation underneath, Samuel adds the crucial third piece — a bulldozing, open-field playmaker. The offensive balance could be unlike anything Washington has had in years.Also read: Russell Wilson’s wife Ciara stuns in fiery dance collab with DK Metcalf’s fiancée Normani In 2021, Deebo Samuel exploded for 1,405 receiving yards, 6 touchdowns, and 365 rushing yards — a historic dual-threat season. Although his production fell to 670 yards in 2024, Washington is banking on a fresh start. Under Kliff Kingsbury’s motion-heavy system, Deebo may finally return to elite form. If so, this Commanders offense could become one of the most dangerous in the NFL.",The washington commanders are reloading with rookie quarterback jayden daniels at the center of their offensive rebuild.

Senator Bernie Sanders has criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for spending millions on his wedding celebrations in Venice, Italy. Sharing a post on microblogging site X (formerly known as Twitter), Sanders condemned the extravagant spend on the wedding, saying “This is oligarchy. This is obscene.” He pointed out that while a large number of Americans “live paycheck to paycheck” and faces issues like hunger, Bezos “goes to Venice on his $500 million yacht for a $20 million wedding & spends $5 million on a ring”. The comments have added to ongoing protest against Bezos’ marriage with fiance Lauren Sanchez . Locals and activists have raised concerns about the disruption caused by the extravagant wedding preparations and the impact of overtourism on the historic city.In the X post, Sanders wrote “This is oligarchy. This is obscene. While 60% live paycheck to paycheck & kids go hungry, Jeff Bezos, worth $230 billion, goes to Venice on his $500 million yacht for a $20 million wedding & spends $5 million on a ring while his real tax rate is just 1.1%. End this oligarchy.”Recently, Greenpeace took part in protests in Venice against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. Protesters held a large banner in St. Mark’s Square that read, “IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX”. According to an Associated Press report, local police quickly removed the banner and asked the small group of demonstrators to leave.The protest is part of the “No Space for Bezos” campaign, which includes local housing groups, student organisations, and anti-cruise activists. They say the wedding is a symbol of the city’s ongoing problems with overtourism and poor local planning. Last week, the group also hung banners from major landmarks and put up posters around the city.","Senator bernie sanders has criticised amazon founder jeff bezos for spending millions on his wedding celebrations in venice, italy.

Third major cut this year at Microsoft; to affect sales and marketing division also

Microsoft will conduct another round of major layoffs in its Xbox gaming division next week as part of a broader company-wide reorganization, according to sources familiar with the plans. Managers within Xbox are expecting substantial cuts across the entire gaming group, marking the fourth significant layoff at the division in 18 months.The upcoming cuts will target thousands of employees primarily in sales divisions, with Xbox bearing a significant portion of the reductions. Bloomberg reported that the layoffs coincide with Microsoft's fiscal year end on June 30, following the company's pattern of making organizational changes during this period.Xbox has faced mounting pressure from Microsoft executives to boost profit margins since the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard closed in 2023. The gaming division has experienced a series of workforce reductions, including 1,900 layoffs in January 2024, 650 cuts in September, and the closure of several game studios including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.Sources indicate Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, with some regional operations ceasing entirely. The Verge reported that these changes aim to align the business for next-generation console development while streamlining operations.The Xbox layoffs represent the third major workforce reduction for Microsoft in 2025, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations weeks later. The company previously announced plans to eliminate approximately 3% of its total 228,000-person workforce as part of efforts to flatten management structure and control costs.Microsoft's sales and marketing division, employing roughly 45,000 workers, will face the heaviest impact from the upcoming cuts. The restructuring reflects the tech giant's strategy to balance massive AI investments, estimated at $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year, with operational efficiency across other business units.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs.","Microsoft will conduct another round of major layoffs in its xbox gaming division next week as part of a broader company-wide reorganization.

Jason Kwao turned pizza deliveries into a million-dirham venture in Dubai

How COVID-19 fueled Jason Kwao's first big e-commerce breakthrough



Jason Kwao’s Amazon business failed but he found a smarter way to succeed



""Every setback brings an equal or greater comeback.""

From seller to strategic consultant: Helping others succeed



""Stay focused. Don't get caught up in the lifestyle temptations. You didn't come here for the clubs—you came here to create something real.""





Dubai is full of tales of success, transformation, and survival but few are more universally inspiring than Jason Kwao's. From humble beginnings in the UK working as a pizza delivery boy to becoming a self-made business owner in the UAE, Jason's story exemplifies the strength of vision, the ability to adapt, and sheer grit. With no business studies and having been a dropout at university, he constructed his achievement one product, one lesson, and one courageous choice at a time. A humble pandemic e-commerce venture turned into a million-dirham business and a booming consultancy. Synchronising personal struggles and professional development, Jason's tale is a true example of what can be achieved when purpose collides with opportunity in a city designed for doers and dreamers.During an interview with, Jason Kwao's journey illustrates his origin as a pizza vendor, a second-hand moped, and an ambition to get away from averageness. As a UK university dropout, Jason frequently became frustrated and discontented. While others flaunted their glamorous businesses on social media, he did various odd jobs and questioned purpose and direction within himself.The delivery of pizzas wasn't glamorous, but it provided him with something essential, discipline and savings.Each tip, each late-night delivery, was a stepping stone. Where most called the job low-skilled, Jason viewed it as a launchpad. It schooled him in customer service, time management, and more importantly, the significance of hard-earned money. One typical day, while mindlessly browsing Instagram, Jason had an epiphany. He saw how much he and millions of others were spending on sites like Amazon. That one epiphany turned his thinking around: ""Why be a consumer when I can be the seller?""Without any business degree but great curiosity, he learned about product ideas and narrowed down on a niche: home baking accessories. His first product? A sourdough breadbasket. Easy, practical, and opportune.The COVID-19 lockdown arrived, and suddenly home baking was all the rage. Families turned to sourdough starters and kneaded bread in the kitchen for comfort. Jason's product was catapulted into demand, according to the reports.Orders started rolling in. What had begun as a small online ad became a viral hit. Jason learned to scale easily fielding customer calls, juggling logistics, and tracking inventory, all by himself. He was making thousands a month by his early twenties. This spike, however, wasn't luck. Jason had spotted a microtrend and acted fast—a key characteristic for any entrepreneur.Success, particularly when it arrives quickly, can promote arrogance. Jason's quick rise led him to overestimate demand and mismanage his inventory. Some miscalculations such as over-ordering inventory resulted in losses. His booming business soon began to implode almost overnight.But Jason didn't walk away. Instead, he drew strength from a matter-of-fact phrase his wife had once spoken to him:The quote became his emotional anchor. Written and taped to their living room wall, it was a daily reminder that failure is not the end—it's a reset. Instead of going back to 9-to-5 employment, Jason bet bigger on creativity. One of his most aggressive gambits was repurposing a surgical knife as a bread scoring knife—a specialty baking tool for creating designs on sourdough bread. The product did well until Amazon ultimately suspended it for policy infringement. Nevertheless, it generated a lot of money while it lasted.He also dabbled in property commissioning potential, especially in student lettings, but soon discovered that consultancy wasn't scalable or rewarding for the long-term. He required greater control—over product sourcing, pricing, and supply chains. That realisation prompted him to source directly from Chinese manufacturers. That action not only raised profit margins but provided him with complete visibility of production timelines and product quality.As his expertise in e-commerce grew, Jason moved from being a seller to becoming a proper Amazon brand consultant. He started assisting other companies in scaling their presence ranging from product listings to supply chain strategies. The effect was substantial. A few of his customers currently bring over £5 million in monthly revenue. Jason's own business reached a valuation of over 1 million dirhams by January 2025, a point of triumph in his evolution from feisty entrepreneur to strategic consultant.Jason is presently focused on storytelling and mentorship. He wants to pay it forward by sharing his story freely—failures, pivots, wins, and all. His goal is to motivate budding entrepreneurs and demonstrate what can be achieved with grit and clarity.

India’s digital economy to cross $1 trillion by 2030: Bessemer Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-digital-economy-to-cross-1-trillion-by-2030-bessemer-report/articleshow/122075316.cms,"AI image

BENGALURU: India’s digital consumer market is set to cross the $1 trillion mark within a decade, fueled by mobile-first behavior and a wave of new consumer brands, according to a new report by Bessemer Venture Partners. The report, titled, finds that rising smartphone usage, affordable mobile data and seamless payments have created a “triple engine” of commerce, content and consumer discernment, making India one of the most dynamic digital economies globally.“Even if this grows at a simplistic rate of 20% every year, it will still cross the trillion-dollar mark,” said Anant Vidur Puri, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the authors of the report. “Time spent on the phone is just going up and up, access to products is far easier, and consumer aspirations have surged. What used to be a trip to the mall and a visit to the movies has now become a mobile-first experience,” he told TOI in an interaction.The report highlighted that mobile internet penetration, with roughly 800 million smartphone users averaging almost eight hours a day online, is reshaping commerce and brand-building.According to the findings, digital platforms have evolved into virtual shelves that enable smaller, niche consumer brands to find national prominence almost instantly.“If you can be a new disruptor, a new trend, a unique thing in the market, the new consumer is looking for you, and platforms will come and get you. A brand can now get listed on 20 platforms almost without doing anything. That has changed in the last ten years and why it’s a great time to build a brand,” Puri said.The report also underscored the growing significance of consumer retention and its impact on long‑term growth. “A brand can scale very rapidly, but eventually you have to live up to the test. Retention is the single most important thing, it changes your time to revenue predictability, reduces your marketing working capital, increases your Ebitda, and reduces your cash burn. You have to solve one thing, and that is retention,” Puri added.Bessemer’s findings point out that India’s digital consumer market comprises many niches, making precision in pricing and positioning vital for new brands. “India is many Indias. What’s affordable for one person is different from what’s affordable for someone else. You have to define very clearly, is your TAM a Rs 100 lipstick, a Rs 500 lipstick, or a Rs 1,999 lipstick? At each price point, someone will consider it ‘cheap’ and someone else ‘expensive’,” Puri said.With an estimated 600 million people in India born after 2001, the consumer trend is being shaped by a generation for whom mobile commerce and digital payments are second nature. “All of them, by the time they went to college, existed in a world where smartphones, blazingfast internet and e‑commerce were just facts. This generation spends more than 50% of their waking time online, that’s where they shop, watch movies, consume content, learn and spend. This is what gives us the conviction that the digital economy will continue to compound for years to come,” Puri said.According to the report, this trend positions India to join the likes of China, where digital commerce accounts for more than 15% of the overall economy, highlighting a long runway for growth. Puri added, “the quick commerce phenomenon, this brand‑building playbook, almost how do you build a brand for a billion Indians, you don’t have to learn from the US. In India, it’s about making brands relevant within the cultural context. These are lessons global markets can learn from India.”","India’s digital consumer market is set to cross the $1 trillion mark within a decade, according to a new report by bessemer venture partners.
