Indian assets

Future build-up

BENGALURU: Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor , multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.“All of our strategic assets were put to use in different ways by our armed forces for Operation Sindoor. Our teams have been working round the clock and we are proud that Isro could help our forces in missions important for the country,” a senior official from Isro told TOI.Another official said that aside from domestic assets directly available with the armed forces (India has 9-11 military satellites ), Isro also facilitated “repeatable” data from a commercial global operator. “While data from our satellites from the Cartosat series and others were also used for planning, images were procured from Maxar ,” the senior official said.Maxar, the US-based satellite imagery provider supplies images to multiple governments and non-government entities across the world, while it remains unclear if Pakistan used its services for any of its operations during the current conflict. It is noteworthy that Pakistan also has access to the extensive military space assets of China.Indian armed forces also have access to other satellite data from Sentinel from Europe and another commercial operator from the US.“Indian satellites provide periodic data - with downloads of specific areas possible about once in 14 days. This data was made use of, while they used commercial data that’s available once a day too,” the official said.The Cartosat family of satellites, with high-resolution imagery and dual-use (image & video) capabilities, has been a key asset in India’s military intelligence toolkit. Launched for the first time in 2005, and progressively upgraded with satellites like the Cartosat-2C (for military), these satellites have provided crucial imagery for operations.Cartosat-2C, for example, delivers images with a resolution of 0.65 metres- an improvement over previous models- and has been vital in reconnaissance and surveillance operations. The high-resolution images from Cartosat can capture areas of interest (AOI) with incredible clarity, enabling commanders to make precise decisions based on intelligence from space. These were used for the 2016 Surgical Strike.Aside from Cartosat, the Risat family of satellites would have provided radar images useful to track movement, while the Gsat family of satellites were used for communications. “In all, a variety of Indian space assets have been useful and efforts are on to increase support to the armed forces in the years to come,” the official said. India’s NavIC combined with other global GPS systems also aided in operations.Indian Space Association (ISpA) director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhat, said: “There would have been extensive use of space assets for imagery, sat-com (satellite communication) and PNT (positioning, navigation and timing). Space technology is an integral part of modern warfare.”Isro chairman V Narayanan, who said Sunday that 10 satellites are working round the clock for the armed forces, did not specifically comment on Operation Sindoor. He, however, told TOI: “We will be launching another important satellite on May 18, the EOS-09 or Risat-1B, which will add teeth to our armed forces.”“The satellite features an advanced C-band synthetic aperture radar system that delivers high-resolution Earth surface imagery in all weather conditions. This capability significantly enhances India’s surveillance capabilities,” he added. Unlike conventional optical satellites limited by cloud cover or darkness, Risat-1B’s radar technology penetrates these obstacles effectively.Earlier this month, Narayanan had said that India would launch 100-150 satellites in the next five years. Among these would be the 52 satellites part of the Space-Based Surveillance-3 (SBS-3) programme. Thirty-one of these will be developed by the private sector.","Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out operation sindoor, multiple sources have confirmed to toi.

NEW DELHI: Max Haot , chief executive officer of US-based company Vast , which is planning to launch the world’s first commercial space station , has evinced interest in using Indian rockets to transport crew members to its upcoming orbital laboratory.In an interview to, Haot, who recently visited India to attend an international space conference GLEX-2025, said, “There is a possibility of using Gaganyaan rockets as a transport service for our space station.”The space-habitation company, which has 750+ team members, is in the race to build a space station called Haven-2 that will be the successor to the International Space Station, which will be retired by 2031.The CEO said, “We want to work with all nations that are engaged in human spaceflight missions and see that India is about to be a leader in human spaceflight, which is really a great thing. We look forward to collaborating with India. We are open to many levels of collaboration. In space stations, we are open to technology exchange within the confines of the export control (regime).”Haot said, “We are very impressed with Isro and the Indian govt in achieving new capabilities, especially in regard to their upcoming Gaganyaan programme and Axiom-4 mission to the ISS that will make India the fourth country in the world to achieve the capability to send an astronaut to space.”Before Haven-2, the California-based company plans to launch Haven-1, a single-module space station, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in May 2026. The Haven-1 spacecraft has a 45-metre-cubed volume and is designed to support up to four crew members for missions of an average of two weeks in length.The first module of Haven-2, a much larger space station, is expected to be launched in 2028. Vast is planning to have the first operational module in 2028 and a fully built and functional space station in 2032. This will be designed for both govt and commercial use. It will have nine modules, 500 cubic metre of habitable volume and 86KW of total power. “We are seeking Nasa aid for the Haven-2 project, which will be managed by VAST. Once operational, this commercial space station will be open to all.”Isro is going to launch its crewed Gaganyaan mission in 2027 and if the mission is successful, more such crewed missions will be launched to space. Though India is making its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, the collaboration with VAST for its commercial space station is likely to be beneficial to India as Isro will gain from the company’s expertise in setting up a space station.","The space-habitation company is in the race to build a space station called haven-2 that will be the successor to the international space station.

Inside the controversy: Why Tom Brady passed on drafting Shedeur Sanders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/inside-the-controversy-why-tom-brady-passed-on-drafting-shedeur-sanders/articleshow/121113985.cms,"Tom Brady choose business over brotherhood in the Shedeur Sanders draft (Image via: Getty Images)

Tom Brady, Shedeur Sanders, and a draft snub that raised questions



""I Texted Shedeur.."" - Tom Brady SPEAKS OUT on Shedeur Sanders Plummeting In NFL Draft

The unanswered questions around Brady and Sanders



In a world where NFL loyalties can blur under business interests, the curious case of Tom Brady and Shedeur Sanders is raising eyebrows across the league. The former Colorado star's unexpected slide to the fifth round in the 2025 NFL Draft shocked many but what came next was even more perplexing. Despite Brady’s long-standing relationship with Sanders and his minority stake in the quarterback-needy Las Vegas Raiders , the team passed on the young signal-caller not once, but repeatedly. Why?Brady, the most decorated quarterback in NFL history, knows a thing or two about draft-day heartbreak. Pick No. 199 in 2000, his rise from overlooked backup to GOAT is legendary. So when he reached out to Shedeur Sanders after his draft fall, it felt like a passing of the torch. “Use it as motivation,” Brady told him, a mentor’s words to a young talent who had just been humbled by the system. But here’s where it gets messy.Despite having direct ties to the Raiders, Brady insists he had no input in the team's draft process. That’s hard to believe. The Raiders, still lacking a solid long-term QB plan, ignored a player with NFL bloodlines, proven college leadership, and Brady’s stamp of approval. Did business acumen outweigh personal connection? Or worse was Brady’s influence downplayed to dodge accountability?Critics aren’t buying the clean-hands narrative. Brady’s role as a minority owner might not give him final say, but to suggest he was totally removed from evaluation discussions feels disingenuous. Especially when Sanders, someone Brady reportedly mentored for years, ended up with the Browns, a team not even rumored to be in the QB hunt early on.Shedeur, to his credit, has taken the high road. He’s echoed Brady’s own draft-day mantra: tunnel vision forward. Still, NFL insiders continue to speculate: Did Brady quietly influence the Raiders’ decision? Or was this just another example of the league’s cutthroat nature, where friendships crumble under corporate strategy?Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers' QB dilemma: Could Carson Wentz be the surprising fix they need? This isn’t the last chapter in the Sanders-Brady-Raiders triangle. With Shedeur now in Cleveland and looking to prove the league wrong, every snap he takes will be watched closely and not just by fans, but by those who let him fall. Did Brady do right by Sanders or did business speak louder than brotherhood?","The curious case of tom brady and shedeur sanders is raising eyebrows across the league.

Nintendo balances pricing against adoption goals

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. The revelation came during Nintendo's May 8 earnings call, just weeks before the console's scheduled June 5 launch.""If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various aspects,"" Furukawa stated, addressing the potential impact on the already premium-priced $449.99 console.Nintendo's forecast assumes tariffs of 10% on products from Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia, while Chinese imports face a staggering 145% tariff (as of now, US and China are renegotiating the trade terms, which possibly could lower the tariff). The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles. If we were to adjust the price of the Switch 2, this could decrease demand.""While Nintendo primarily manufactures Switch hardware for North America in Vietnam, certain accessories and amiibo figures come from China, subjecting them to higher tariff rates.Despite these challenges, Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in its first year – matching the original Switch's debut performance – though analysts describe this projection as ""conservative"" given the tariff uncertainties.The company faces a delicate balancing act between covering increased costs and maintaining consumer interest. ""Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers,"" Furukawa emphasized.The Switch 2 isn't alone in facing potential price hikes. Microsoft has already increased Xbox Series S prices by $80 and Series X by $100, while some smaller gaming hardware companies have suspended U.S. shipments entirely due to prohibitive tariff costs.Pre-orders for the Switch 2 opened on April 24 following a brief delay related to tariff concerns, with Nintendo warning that release-day delivery cannot be guaranteed due to overwhelming d","Nintendo president shuntaro furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming switch 2 console.

HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s 4QFY25 EBITDA was a 110% beat on est., driven by higher-than-estimated GRM (USD8/bbl) as well as marketing margins (INR5.9/lit). With tax rate coming in below est. , resultant PAT stood 5x above est. at INR72.6b. While the OMC rally may be nearing its end, near-term catalysts remain. 1Q earnings may benefit from lower LPG under-recoveries after recent ₹50/cylinder price hike, softer propane prices, higher Russian crude intake aiding GRMs, and steady marketing earnings.It is well-positioned with major refinery expansions (~17.7mmtpa) scheduled for 4QFY6–1HFY27 & plans to add 3,000–4,000 new retail outlets in FY26 to its 40,000+ network. The recent drop in crude prices below $60/bbl—the lowest since Feb’21—also provides a favourable backdrop for margins.M&M reported a better-than-expected performance in Q4, led by a strong margin beat in the FES segment (at 19.4% vs 17.3% est.).Revenue grew 24.5% YoY, and EBITDA margin expanded 180bp YoY to 14.9%, driven by improved ASPs across both the Auto and FES segments. Management remains confident of outperforming the UV industry in FY26, driven by new launches like Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, and recent EVs. It plans to boost UV capacity to 69k/85K units in FY26/FY27, with a greenfield project for future requirements beyond FY28. We believe MM is well-placed to outperform across its core business, driven by healthy recovery in rural areas and new product launches across both UV and tractor segments. We estimate MM to post CAGR of 13%/13%/18% in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25–27E.","Motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting may 12, 2025) are indian oil corporation ltd and m&m.

JP Morgan is underweight on Dr Reddy’s Laboratories with the target price at Rs 1,060. Analysts said the pharma major’s Jan-March revenue was in line, but EBITDA missed estimates. According to them the underweight rating is premised on weak core EBITDA margins, lacklustre growth in India, lack of visibility on niche launches in the US and Semaglutide opportunity can be decent but the market is expected to be competitive. Citigroup has a buy rating on Biocon with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said Biocon’s Jan-March numbers were weak as ex-gRevlimid EBITDA margin declined. The company also reported about 4% annual growth in biosimilars despite a strong market share expansion in onco assets that indicates a weak pricing scenario. Nomura has given a ‘buy’ rating on Zydus Life with the target price at Rs 1,140. Analysts said the company has received approval for gCopaxone, which they estimate has a market size of $600 million. Besides Teva, there are two generic players for the same. They also expect additional competition in future from Biocon and Dr Reddy’s. Macquarie maintained its underperform rating on Swiggy with the target price at Rs 260. Calling the Jan-March numbers ‘from bad to worse’, they said Swiggy’s results continued to under-score the challenges for the platform. The management now expects contribution margin break even in 3-5 quarters versus prior guidance of achieving the same by December 2025.They also pointed out that the margin gap to Eternal (Zomato) continued to narrow. Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Pidilite with the target price at Rs 3,475. Analysts said the company's strong, near-double digit volume growth continued despite a muted environment. The management is optimistic about FY26 growth given some improvement in the broader consumption environment.

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India uk fta is new in the series of bilateral ftas negotiated in the recent past.

: German software major SAP has adjusted its diversity and inclusion targets in accordance with developments in the US. SAP is ceasing the aspirational target of 40% for women in the workforce, the firm said in an internal communication to employees. It also substituted the ' women in executive roles ' KPI within the board's long-term incentive plan with the business health culture index (BHCI). This new index, the company said, provides a more holistic view of the full employee experience at SAP, measuring how effectively it fosters engagement, promotes health, ensures equal opportunity for all, and supports long-term employability.“We are adjusting demographic targets to meet regulatory requirements – e.g.,modifying the metric 'Women in Executive Roles' by moving from three levels below the Executive Board (set voluntarily in the past) to two levels below the Executive Board (as required by German law), not considering executive representation in the US.” SAP said that these changes reflect external realities, but they do not change the firm’s commitment. “Being a global company with a significant US presence, we are also responding to external changes as we evolve, such as recent legal developments in the US.”When TOI reached out to SAP, the company directed the publication to a statement on its website, which said, “With this, SAP also adjusts its non-financial guidance. The guidance for Women in Executive Roles will be replaced with the BHCI. SAP measured and reported the BHCI, which is based on the results of the company’s employee engagement surveys, since 2009. In 2025, SAP expects a BHCI score in the range of 80% to 82%,” it said.SAP said that it is planning a structural change to further strengthen its impact: “Adhering to the necessary country-specific legal frameworks, we aim to bring our diversity & inclusion office together with corporate social responsibility (CSR) later this year to form a unified team called 'Social Responsibility, Inclusion and Communities', within the people & culture board area,” the note said.In its 2024 integrated annual report, SAP said that the firm started measuring the women in the workforce (WiW) as the share of women in the total workforce in 2012. For this KPI, its previous goal was to reach 35% by 2022, which it reached before 2022.""We're also planning a structural change to further strengthen our impact: Adhering to the necessary country-specific legal frameworks, we aim to bring our Diversity & Inclusion office together with corporate social responsibility (CSR) later this year to form a unified team called 'Social Responsibility, Inclusion and Communities', within the people & culture board area,"" SAP said in an email to employees.","Sap is ceasing the aspirational target of 40% for women in the workforce.
