Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ripped apart for ‘clueless’ fashion choices during NYC date night

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may be one of the most talked-about celebrity couples of the decade, but even their status and their bank accounts can't shield them from fashion criticism. During their recent date night at New York City’s exclusive Zero Bond, the pair stepped out in designer looks that should have been effortless wins.Yet social media users were quick to pounce, questioning whether the two style icons were having an off night or simply leaning too hard into their signature quirks. While Swift’s rose-embroidered tights and wrap miniskirt drew plenty of attention, Kelce’s relaxed burgundy ensemble raised eyebrows too. Their outfits, worth thousands, became instant conversation starters and not necessarily for the reasons they hoped.Swift arrived in a textured wrap miniskirt, twisted-collar knit top, and knee-high Louis Vuitton boots, a look elevated by a gold-chained Coussin bag, simple jewelry, and her signature red lip. Her black Fleur De Mal hosiery, embroidered with roses and styled with a long braid detail, ended up being the focal point of online debate.Kelce’s coordinated burgundy bomber jacket and loose trousers, paired with gold chains and black boots, completed the duo’s coordinated aesthetic.But critics didn’t hold back. One person wrote, “They seriously have no fashion sense. Matchy matchy like they bought whatever was on the mannequin.” Another jabbed at their wealth, saying, “They would think that with all that money, they would shop somewhere other than the Goodwill Store for clothing.” Others chimed in about Swift’s predictable favorites: “Her dress sense is terrible. Always a short skirt and long boots. So boring and predictable.” Another commenter couldn’t resist aiming at Kelce: “Does he get dressed in the dark?”Despite the commentary, Swift’s fashion influence continues to dominate pop culture. From plaid skirts inspired by her Folklore era to the red tights she wears on game days, her style reaches fans who admire the mix of high-end, vintage, and approachable trends. Her generosity also stands out, such as when she gifted young fan Naya the full Miu Miu outfit she wore during their hospital meeting, turning fashion into a meaningful connection.Kelce, meanwhile, has his own evolving style journey, sometimes shaped or criticized by Swift’s influence. But together, the couple walks with unshakable confidence. Whether fans love or hate their looks, Swift and Kelce prove one thing: fashion is most powerful when it reflects who you are, not who people expect you to be.","Taylor swift and travis kelce’s latest nyc date night ignited online backlash.

Connor Hellebuyck net worth in 2025: Updated wealth projections for the Jets star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-hellebuyck-net-worth-in-2025-updated-wealth-projections-for-the-jets-star/articleshow/125392393.cms,"Connor Hellebuyck (Image Source: Getty)

Detailed look at Connor Hellebuyck’s contract structure and income

Estimated net worth projection as of 2025

Connor Hellebuyck has established himself as one of the premier players in the NHL. As of 2025, his financial profile reflects the elite level at which he has performed for nearly a decade. He is known for his consistency, durability, and impact. He continues to shape both the team’s future and his own earning potential through long-term contracts. These are further enhanced by performance bonuses and career achievements that elevate his value.Connor was born in Commerce, Michigan. He was drafted 130th overall in the fifth round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Hellebuyck’s journey began with modest expectations. After signing his entry-level contract in 2014, he worked his way through the AHL. This was followed by firming his presence in the NHL during the 2016–17 season. Since then, his trajectory has been marked by achievements. The 2020 Vezina Trophy, multiple franchise records, and a reputation as one of the most reliable goaltenders of his generation are among them.By 2025, Hellebuyck’s financial stability is largely catered to by the seven-year, $59.5 million contract.He signed with the Winnipeg Jets on October 9, 2023. The deal carries an average annual value (AAV) of $8.5 million. It includes a $5 million signing bonus paid in the 2024–25 season and guarantees the full contract value. This is a major factor in evaluating his projected net worth.For the 2025–26 campaign, Hellebuyck will earn a base salary of $10 million with a matching total cash payout of $10 million. His remaining cap was unchanged at $8.5 million. This made the Jets cost certain while ensuring the goaltender receives substantial compensation during the peak years of his career. Earlier deals like his six-year, $37 million contract signed in 2018 also contribute significantly to his accumulated earnings.Also Read: Connor Hellebuyck crowned NHL 26’s top goaltender as Winnipeg Jets dominate EA Sports rankings According to sources, Hellebuyck’s estimated career earnings are roughly $61.5 million by 2025, not including future guaranteed income. His annual salaries over time reflect his steady rise from an entry-level player earning under $1 million per season to one of the highest-paid goaltenders in the league.A realistic projection for Hellebuyck’s net worth in 2025 would fall between $35 million and $45 million. This range reflects his career earnings to date. This also includes the guaranteed money remaining on his contract, and financial considerations for professional athletes such as taxes, agent fees, living expenses, and personal investments.Some public estimates list his net worth as low as $5 million, but such figures do not align with confirmed contract data or the guaranteed structure of his long-term deals. Given the sizable income he has earned and continues to earn, higher projections are far more consistent with his financial reality.","Connor hellebuyck was born in commerce, michigan.

Elias Pettersson’s wife Katelyn Byrd details work behind building “Swete” from scratch



Vancouver Diaries: Elias Surprise Birthday + Swete Launch

Vancouver Canucks forward Elias Pettersson’s wife, Katelyn Byrd, is stepping confidently into the world of entrepreneurship, and her latest vlog gives fans an intimate look at the passion project she has been quietly building behind the scenes. Her new premium candy brand, Swete, made its first official appearance at Rogers Arena, but the real story lies in the months of work, planning, and self-driven determination that brought the idea to life.Katelyn’s vlog captures the raw excitement of launch day but also the vulnerability that comes with taking on a business entirely by herself. She explains that Swete has been a dream she wanted to shape on her own terms, without a team or outside help. That independence comes through clearly in her message, as she describes the process as overwhelming yet deeply rewarding. The video also includes a warm personal touch—a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the sweet birthday surprise she prepared for Pettersson, making the vlog a blend of entrepreneurship and family moments.In her video, Katelyn opens up about the motivation behind launching Swete and reveals how much of the journey has been carried on her shoulders alone.“I always have wanted to start a company, so I made sure that I started it myself. It’s a one-man show right now so I’m very overwhelmed,” she admitted, offering viewers an honest look at the pressure and pride that come with running a business solo.The debut of Swete at a Vancouver Canucks home game marked a major milestone for her, and although she planned to film more backstage moments, the energy inside the arena took over. Katelyn says she wanted to soak in the reactions of fans trying Swete for the first time, something that made the launch even more meaningful.Alongside the business update, Katelyn added a heartfelt moment by sharing the birthday surprise she put together for Elias Pettersson. The clip offers a glimpse at their off-ice life, adding warmth and personality to the entrepreneurial story fans were already invested in.Swete will continue to be available at every Canucks home game, with an online release on the way. Until then, she encourages fans to stay connected through the brand’s social platforms as she builds the next chapter of her growing venture.More coverage on NHL:","Vancouver canucks forward elias pettersson’s wife, katelyn byrd, is stepping confidently into the world of entrepreneurship.

Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in texas through 2027.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella quotes Bill Gates to explain what makes a true AI platform; Elon Musk responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-quotes-bill-gates-to-explain-what-makes-a-true-ai-platform-elon-musk-responds/articleshow/125362427.cms,"

Nadella says Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI is an example of zero-sum mindset industry





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently shared a post explaining what he believes defines a real artificial intelligence (AI) platform — and he turned to a well-known idea from Bill Gates to make his point. In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), Nadella said tech companies should focus on building AI systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them, not just for the companies that make the technology. He cited Bill Gates to emphasize the same: “A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to Nadella's post with a facepalm emoji.Nadella said this idea matters even more during the current AI boom, where many firms risk giving away too much of their own value to big tech platforms. “The real question is how to empower every company out there to build their own AI-native capabilities,” he wrote.Nadella pointed to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI as an example of how a “positive-sum” approach can work. “Our investment helped them scale; their research accelerated our own innovation,” he said, adding that both companies benefited by improving each other’s products and infrastructure.Nadella also highlighted the companies involved in building Microsoft’s new AI infrastructure. He said the world’s first “AI superfactory” — recently announced by Microsoft and OpenAI — was developed using learnings from three generations of AI supercomputers and through close collaboration with Nvidia.He added that Microsoft has now integrated AMD chips as well, giving startups and enterprises more options for training and running their AI models.The Microsoft CEO said the real test of the AI era will not be tech valuations but whether industries like healthcare, manufacturing, education and agriculture see real-world gains. “When a pharma company uses AI to bring a new therapy to market in one year instead of twelve… that’s when we’ll know the system is working,” he said.He urged companies to avoid “zero-sum thinking” and warned them to protect their own data and value instead of relying solely on partnerships that may turn “extractive” over time.Nadella concluded by saying the industry has an opportunity to ensure AI benefits are widely spread — a lesson, he noted, that comes from past waves of technology where some sectors, like local media, were left behind.",Satya nadella says tech companies should focus on building ai systems that create more value for the people and businesses using them.

Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.",Blue origin’s second-try success marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has declared that the next decade represents a period of immense historical consequence, arguing that the coming 10 years will have a greater determination over the next 100 years than any prior era due to the arrival of non-human intelligence, or artificial intelligence (AI). Schmidt compared the emergence of AI to fundamental inventions in human history, such as electricity or the invention of fire, stressing its revolutionary power.“We are fortunate to be living in a time of great historical consequence,” Schmidt said in a virtual interview recently. He emphasised that the new AI tools are very powerful because they can “equal and, in some cases, surpass human intelligence,"" which is the source of societal growth and innovation.""The countries and companies that embrace this non-human intelligence correctly and aggressively will be the big winners,"" Schmidt stated.Conversely, he warned that companies and countries that slow their adoption or allow others to lead will fall behind, as economic growth and leadership are derived from the application of intelligence to solve new problems.“And the companies and countries that slow or let other people do it, they will lose because the source of excellence, the source of leadership, the source of growth, the source of everything, the source of innovation…everything..ofeconomic growth comes from the application of intelligence to discover new things to solve new problems,” he said.Schmidt also sounded a major geopolitical alarm, naming the potential global dominance of Chinese open-source AI models as one of his “biggest fears” for the future of the technology.Speaking on the Moonshots podcast this week, Schmidt highlighted a growing divergence in the global AI landscape:US Models: Primarily closed-source and costly.Chinese Models: Largely open-source and free.“The geopolitical issue there, of course, is that open source is free and the closed source models are not free,” Schmidt explained.

The Labour Commissioner office in Pune has summoned Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in matters filed by the IT industry employees union, Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). In its complaint, NITES alleged unlawful terminations and layoffs by TCS. NITES shared the same in a post on microblogging website, Twitter.

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference. The survey asked founders and investors which ai startup they would be willing to bet against. Ai search startup perplexity received the most votes, followed by chatgpt-maker openai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125364066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33282,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.",Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

Historic first crewed eVTOL flight in Dubai

The aircraft, speeds and where you’ll board?

Qatar’s quiet coup





Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air-taxi flight, a short point-to-point journey being hailed as a milestone on the road to commercial air-taxi service in 2026.If you want the first visual, the Dubai Media Office video shows the aircraft lifting off at Margham and landing at DWC during the trials; it’s the clearest public footage of the crewed point-to-point run. Expect more test flights, phased certification steps and vertiport roll-outs through 2025–2026, ahead of the first commercial routes planned for 2026.On 16 November 2025, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), in partnership with Joby Aviation, completed the first crewed eVTOL flight between Margham and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), a point-to-point test that demonstrates vertical take-off, cruise and landing in an operational context. The RTA and Dubai Media Office released video and statements showing the short crewed journey as part of trials ahead of a planned 2026 launch. Watch the official clip from Dubai Media Office for the moment the aircraft lifted off and landed:[Also read: Dubai unveils 4 launch pads for Flying Taxis: Where you’ll catch the World’s first aerial taxi in 2026 Dubai’s air-taxi programme is built around the Joby Aviation S4 eVTOL, a quiet, all-electric aircraft with six rotors, four battery packs and a performance profile that allows speeds of up to 320 km/h and ranges of around 160 km per charge, making it ideal for fast city hops.Each aircraft will carry four passengers plus one pilot, offering a compact but premium cabin with panoramic windows and low noise levels compared to helicopters.To support the service, the RTA is developing a network of dedicated vertiports, starting with Dubai International Airport (DXB), Palm Jumeirah, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, with the DXB hub already about 60% complete and designed to handle up to 170,000 passengers a year. These strategically chosen points are meant to slash travel times—for example, a 45-minute ground trip could take just 12 minutes by air. Watch the video for a close-up look at what the air taxi offers, inside and out:Although pricing is not final, early estimates suggest fares could sit around US$75, similar to a high-end ride-hailing service, with the long-term aim of becoming competitive with regular taxis. Joby has already completed hundreds of piloted test flights globally and holds exclusive operating rights in Dubai for six years, while passengers will eventually be able to book flights through a dedicated mobile app, with fast charging and quick turnarounds enabling frequent daily operations.Overall, the system is being built as a smooth, airport-style experience, compact vertiports, efficient boarding, pilot-operated flights and seamless links to the metro, buses and taxis, making air taxis feel less like futuristic experiments and more like an everyday transport option.Days before the Dubai spectacle, Qatar secured a different, but equally significant, victory by focusing on full autonomy. On November 15, 2025, the country celebrated the successful trial of its first-ever urban passenger flight with a fully unmanned eVTOL.The event was sponsored and witnessed by H.E. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Thani, the Minister of Transport (MoT).The aircraft operated without any direct human interference, relying entirely on a full self-control system enabled by AI and advanced air navigation technologies. The pilotless taxi flew successfully between the Old Doha Port and the Katara Cultural Village.This initiative is a core part of the MoT Strategy 2025-2030, which aims to create a smart, resilient transportation system to support Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and reduce the nation's carbon footprint.",Dubai has completed its first crewed electric vertical take-off and landing (evtol) air-taxi flight.

How Dubai residents with Dh15k-20k salary can now buy a Dh1 million house with 'first home' initiative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/how-dubai-residents-with-dh15k-20k-salary-can-now-buy-a-dh1-million-house-with-first-home-initiative/articleshow/125376405.cms,"Backed by 13 developers and 5 banks, the initiative helps Dubai residents earning Dh15,000 to Dh20,000 buy a home with up to 10% discounts and affordable mortgages (AI illustrative image)

Step 1: Determine affordability and choose the right property

30% of Dh18,000 = Dh5,400

This means that, ideally, your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed Dh5,400.



Step 2: Mortgage breakdown and affordability

Loan Amount: Dh900,000 (after taking the full 10% discount for estimate on the original property price of Dh1,000,000).

Interest Rate: 3.5% per annum

Loan Tenure: 18 years







Step 3: Plan for upfront costs and financing

Initial Investment: Dh200,000

Discounted Property Price: Dh900,000 (after 10% discount)

Loan Amount: Dh700,000

Monthly original Payment: Dh5,544

Savings: If you’ve been saving for a while, now is the time to use those funds for your home purchase.

Employer Assistance: Some companies offer home loan assistance or partnerships with financial institutions that may help with the down payment.

Personal Loans or Support: If necessary, you might consider a personal loan to cover part of the down payment, though this should be done carefully to avoid over-leveraging.

Step 4: Maximize program benefits and get expert support

Choose the Right Property: Stay within the Dh1 million price range to keep your mortgage payments manageable (under 30% of your salary).

Leverage Discounts: Use up to 10% discounts on property prices. For instance, if a home is priced at Dh900,000, you’ll only finance Dh810,000, reducing monthly payments.

Use Flexible Payment Plans: Opt for flexible payment plans on off-plan units that let you pay part of the cost upfront and spread the rest over time.

DLD Fee Benefits: Take advantage of the option to pay Dubai Land Department (DLD) registration fees in interest-free instalments, easing your upfront costs.

(DLD) registration fees in interest-free instalments, easing your upfront costs. Work With the Right Broker: Partner with a licensed broker to find properties that match your budget and eligibility criteria.

Get Pre-Approved for Financing: Secure pre-approval from a participating bank to understand what you can afford and streamline the home-buying process.

Disclaimer: The figures provided are rough estimates, meant to illustrate how the First-Time Homeownership Initiative can make homeownership more accessible. Actual costs, discounts, and mortgage terms may vary based on factors such as bank policies, property specifics, and developer offers.





For many Dubai residents earning between Dh15,000 and Dh20,000 per month, owning a home has long seemed out of reach, especially with property prices frequently surpassing Dh1 million. However, Dubai's new First-Time Homeownership Initiative, aimed at making homeownership accessible to first-time buyers, offers support for properties priced up to Dh5 million. Backed by 13 developers and 5 major banks, the program provides significant benefits, including priority access to new off-plan units, preferential pricing, and direct discounts of up to 10% on property prices.Additionally, the initiative offers flexible mortgage payment plans with better rates from participating banks, making homeownership more affordable. DLD registration fees can also be paid in interest-free instalments, easing the upfront financial burden.So, if you’re eyeing that Dh1 million home, here’s how you can plan your strategy, estimate your costs, and make the most of these benefits to bring your dream of homeownership closer to reality. With this initiative, even moderate-income earners can turn the goal of owning a home into a viable possibility.Let’s say you’re earning Dh18,000 per month, placing you comfortably within the program’s targeted salary range.The First-Time Homeownership Initiative aims to make homeownership a reality for people like you, with homes priced up to Dh1 million eligible under the program. According to the common mortgage lending rule, banks typically recommend that no more than 30% of your monthly income should go towards housing costs (including both the mortgage repayment and associated property costs like maintenance and insurance).Here’s how we calculate this:Now, let’s consider the mortgage options available through this program. With 18-year loan tenures on offer, the total amount you can borrow will depend on the interest rate, which is among the lowest available to first-time buyers under this initiative.Now, let’s see how the First-Time Homeownership Initiative supports this.The program offers competitive interest rates, making homeownership more accessible for residents earning Dh15,000 to Dh20,000 per month. While typical mortgage rates in Dubai range from 3.5% to 4.5%, this initiative, backed by major banks and developers, provides below-market financing options. A 3.5% interest rate is realistic and competitive, ensuring affordable monthly payments for first-time buyers in the mid-income range.Assuming an interest rate of 3.5%, which is reasonable given the program's supportive nature, here’s how the numbers break down for a Dh1,000,000 home:Using the standard mortgage calculation formula, the estimated monthly payment comes out to be around Dh5,544 (precise), which is just slightly above the 30% salary rule. With Dh18,000 per month in salary, the monthly payment of Dh5,544 still remains manageable, offering a solid financial foundation for first-time buyers.While the program offers numerous benefits, it’s important to keep in mind the upfront costs, including the down payment and closing costs. As is typical in Dubai’s property market, you will generally need to make a 20% down payment on the purchase price. In case this requirement remains 20%, even with the initiative's benefits, we've used this figure for a safe estimate. For a Dh1,000,000 property, this means a Dh200,000 down payment.If you're able to make the upfront payment of Dh200,000, your loan amount will reduce to Dh700,000, bringing the monthly payment down to approximately Dh4,314 per month.Though the down payment may seem steep, there are several ways to manage this:To make the most of the First-Time Homeownership Initiative, consider these tips:","Dubai's new first-time homeownership initiative aims to make homeownership accessible to first-time buyers.
