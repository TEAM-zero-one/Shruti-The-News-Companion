Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver





The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the san francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.","Steve jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns pixar's pete docter.

Dating apps turn into free food platforms with 'foodie calls' on the rise



Social media reacts to new dating trend ‘foodie call’



Is it being smart or just selfish? What the research suggests



When dating becomes a strategy for surviving city life

Dating in the digital age is evolving fast, and not always in the way you’d expect. Forget candlelit connections and heartfelt chats with today’s new dating ritual, swiping right with one thing in mind: food. With inflation tightening wallets and brunch prices soaring, a cheeky new trend called the “foodie call” is taking over dating apps . Instead of searching for love, many are hunting for their next free meal. Popular on TikTok and beyond, users openly admit to going on dates just to enjoy a good restaurant and no matching or compatibility required. It’s dating with a side of strategy, and the internet can’t stop talking about a new dating trend or a new foodie strategy?These apps that were once meant to bring about romantic relationships are being comparably joked about as DoorDash by those who use them to fill their bellies, rather than their hearts. A "" foodie call "" is when a person will accept a date for the purpose of getting a free meal, but with no plans to take things further in terms of a relationship, or even a second date.According to the New York Post reports, South Carolina graphic designer Katheryne Slack admitted in an interview on MarketWatch that she asked a Hinge match out for coffee not due to interest, but because she was out at home. They hadn't talked in days, but when she could make it work, she met him at a coffee shop. ""As soon as I met him, I knew I wasn't into him. But I was already there and needed my coffee,"" she said.Social media has escalated the trend. Hilarious videos under hashtags such as #datingfordinner or #foodiecall feature young women ostentatiously documenting their dating lives, highlighting the number of free dinners they have received in a week.In one of the viral videos, @jocelynaleenaa posted, ""When you keep going on dates for the free food & drinks,"" while others cracked jokes about not having to do grocery shopping at all by making back-to-back dates a meal prep. In another video, a lady was dancing to the caption: ""Off on my second date this week 'cause I can't be bothered to meal prep.""To others, it's a ""budget hack"" in times of economic uncertainty, even when it's a bit of a gray area morally.Although ""foodie calls"" may look like and feel like cheeky behavior, researchers contend there could be darker psychological tendencies involved. The journal Society for Personality and Social Psychology published a study in 2019 that reported that as many as 1 in 3 women acknowledged going out on dates for free food alone. More significantly, persons who habitually make such calls ranked higher in the ""dark triad"" traits of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. These are persons who usually take advantage of social situations and have no guilt for being deceitful.With rents that are through the roof and an endless roster of hip restaurants, urban areas such as New York have become breeding ground for ""dinner dating."" East Village resident Olivia Balsinger described dining on a five-course meal at the pricey Catch restaurant in the Meatpacking District that is all on her date's bill. ""If I had had to pay,"" she confessed, ""I probably wouldn't have been able to eat for weeks afterwards. Though the ritual may seem innocent or even sly in the view of some, others see it as emotional manipulation. The unaware date not only pays the bill but often ends up confused or disappointed, unaware they were never a romantic player in the first place.","Dating apps that were once meant to bring about romantic relationships are being joked about as doordash by those who use them to fill their bellies, rather than their hearts.

While acknowledging job transformation, Huang emphasized AI's potential to create new opportunities and boost productivity.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction.

Intel to begin laying off factory workers in July

Intel has reputedly confirmed the fresh round of layoffs affecting 20% of its employees in the manufacturing division. As reported by Oregonlive, the global semiconductor manufacturer is planning to layoff between 15% to 20% of employees from its manufacturing unit. The report reveals that the decision of layoff was announced via an internal memo to staff. The company states that the layoffs are part of a broader starergic overhaul and is aimed at addressing company’s financial challenges . Naga Chandrasekaran , Intel's manufacturing vice president, conveyed the difficult news to employees in an email over the weekend.In the internal memo seen by Oregonlive, Chandrasekaran acknowledged the gravity of the decision. “These are difficult actions, but essential to meet our affordability challenges and the current financial position of the company.”Chandrasekaran further added that the company will treat the affected employees ‘with care and respect’ and that the reductions would be based on a combination of portfolio changes, skill assessments, and project prioritization.“Removing organizational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution. We are making these decisions based on careful consideration of what’s needed to position our business for the future, added Chandrasekaran.Intel is set to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July. The initial round of layoffs is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The fresh round of layoffs will impact thousands of employees globally, particularly those within Intel Foundry , the company's in-house chip manufacturing division.While specific numbers and affected locations have not been publicly detailed, Oregon, home to Intel's largest manufacturing base with approximately 20,000 workers, is anticipated to be significantly impacted.In a statement sent to Tom’s Hardware, Intel wrote: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Reid Hoffman said, ""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Reid Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote in the post.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman believes young people should not fear ai.

Why Trump’s America-made T1 Mobile is a far-fetched reality



President Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile, just weeks after threatening Apple and Samsung with steep tariffs unless they move production to the United States. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his ""America First"" manufacturing rhetoric while offering consumers a domestic alternative to foreign-made devices.Trump's flagship device, the T1 Phone 8002 (Gold version), carries a $499 price tag and can be reserved with a $100 down payment for September delivery. The phone is marketed as ""designed and built in the USA,"" positioning it as the patriotic choice Trump has been demanding from major manufacturers.The launch comes after Trump's May threat to impose ""at least 25 percent"" tariffs on iPhones and similar devices manufactured overseas. He specifically targeted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating that iPhones sold in America must be manufactured domestically, not in India or elsewhere. Trump extended the tariff threat to ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product,"" as he told White House reporters, with implementation potentially beginning at the end of June. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his broader commitment to reshoring technology manufacturing.The T1 Phone 8002 boasts some impressive hardware for its price, including a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, 256GB storage, 12GB RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery. The device features three rear cameras led by a 50MP main sensor, Android 15, and notably includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rarity among modern smartphones.However, the Trump Mobile website doesn't tell much about the smartphone, and displays what appears to be heavily manipulated product images. No processor is listed despite a dedicated section on the specifications page, a critical omission for any smartphone launch.Industry observers note that the September delivery timeline seems optimistic given the typical 12-18 month development cycle for new smartphones. The Trump Mobile venture requires customers to place $100 deposits for pre-orders, with the remainder due upon delivery.Trump's assertion that the phone is manufactured domestically contradicts industry consensus about smartphone production capabilities in the United States. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that domestic iPhone production faces significant infrastructure and supply chain challenges.Currently, virtually no smartphone manufacturers, including those based in the US, produce their devices on American soil. The complex supply chains and specialized manufacturing capabilities required for modern smartphones remain concentrated in Asia, particularly China, despite ongoing efforts by companies like Apple to diversify production to countries like India.","The launch comes after trump's may threat to impose ""at least 25 percent"" tariffs on iphones and similar devices manufactured overseas.

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey hinton, the “godfather of ai,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

What Microsoft has to say



The Better Business Bureau 's National Advertising Division has called out Microsoft for its confusing overuse of "" Copilot "" branding across AI products, recommending the company modify its advertising claims and clarify product functionality differences. Microsoft disagrees with the findings but says it will comply with the watchdog's recommendations.The NAD reviewed Microsoft's Copilot advertising and found that the company's ""universal use of the product description as 'Copilot'"" creates consumer confusion, as customers ""would not necessarily understand the difference"" between various AI tools bearing the same name. The watchdog specifically criticized Microsoft's claim that Copilot works ""seamlessly across all your data,"" noting that Business Chat requires manual copying and pasting to achieve the same functionality as Copilot in individual Office applications.NAD also challenged Microsoft's productivity statistics, recommending the company discontinue or modify claims that ""67%, 70%, and 75% of users say they are more productive"" after using Copilot for extended periods. The watchdog determined that while the study demonstrates perceived productivity improvements, it doesn't provide objective evidence of actual productivity gains.The criticism comes amid Microsoft's years-long branding confusion around Copilot products. The company has repeatedly rebranded its AI tools, with Business Chat evolving from a Teams chatbot to Business Chat for Microsoft 365 Copilot, while Bing Chat Enterprise became simply ""Copilot"" before further rebranding.Microsoft's AI at Work chief marketing officer Jared Spataro defended the company's approach, stating they ""take seriously our responsibility to provide clear, transparent, and accurate information to our customers."" He highlighted customer success stories, including Barclays deploying Copilot to 100,000 employees and Dow identifying millions in potential savings.A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the company disagrees with NAD's conclusions about advertising implications but will follow the recommendations. This latest scrutiny adds to Microsoft's long history of product naming challenges, with employees previously joking that the company would have called Apple's iPod the ""Microsoft I-pod Pro 2005 XP Human Ear Professional Edition with Subscription.""","The better business bureau called out microsoft for its confusing overuse of "" copilot "" branding.

CHENNAI: Coins are going for a toss, literally. Thanks to a substantial jump in UPI transactions, the value and volume of coins in circulation is witnessing a dip YoY.An analysis by TOI based on data in RBI's annual reports over the past one decade reveals that the volume of coins in circulation increased by just 3.6% in 2024-25 over 2023-24 when compared with 8.5% growth during 2016-17 (when UPI came into being) vs 2015-16. Its value of increase also reduced by about 5% from 14.7% (2016-17 vs 2015-16) to 9.6% (2024-25 vs 2023-24).The volume of coins in circulation in multiple denominations such as 50 paise, Re 1, Rs 2, Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 20 stood at 13.7 lakh pieces valuing Rs 36,589 crore as on March 31, 2025. Coins of Re 1, Rs 2, and Rs 5 together constituted 81.6% of the total volume of coins in circulation, while in value terms, these denominations accounted for 64.2%.Subsequently, the number of UPI transactions spiralled from 6.4 million with a value of Rs 2,425 crore by the end of March 2017 to a whopping 18.3 billion UPI transactions with a value of Rs 24,77,221 crore in March 2025, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data states. UPI was launched in April 2016.In contrast, coins in circulation recorded a sustained growth in demand till 2016-17. The total value of coins in circulation increased to 14.7% in 2016-17 against 12.4% during the previous year (2015-16).Its total volume marginally went up to 8.5% in 2016-17 from 8.2% in 2015-16. Its growth was the lowest during the Covid year of 2020-21, wherein the total value increased by 2.1% and volume inched up by hardly 1%. Further, its total volume increased by 2.6% and 3.5% year-on-year in 2022-23 and 2023-24, respectively.Coins remain crucial for low-value transactions especially in rural areas, small retail, and public utilities, where digital adoption is limited. According to analysts, minting of higher-denomination coins such as Rs 10 and Rs 20 has contributed to the rise in value terms, even as the broader economy continues to digitise.Vaibhav Koul, MD - technology and digital, Protiviti Member Firm for India said, UPI transactions have significantly contributed to reducing the demand for tendering change, especially in urban and semi-urban areas.","The volume of coins in circulation in multiple denominations such as 50 paise, re 1, rs 2, rs 5, rs 10 and rs 20 stood at 13.7 lakh pieces valuing rs 36,589 crore as on march 31, 2025.

NEW DELHI: Generative AI, while being used by cyber criminals to further their activities, will also help create stronger and swifter counter-measures, making the internet safer to use, according to Heather Adkins, global VP of engineering for Google Security. Adkins, who spent over two decades at Google, also believes that rise in geopolitical tensions may fuel state-backed cyberattacks, making the world more vulnerable.However, she added that Indian govt has been at forefront of taking measures to counter cyber threats effectively, ahead of many other countries. This will also see Google Security set up an engineering centre in India.Talking to TOI on the sidelines of the 'Safer with Google India Summit', Adkins said while companies create tools to tackle cyber threats, it is equally important to sensitise users about measures to identify malicious and fraudulent content. ""Unlike the physical world where you have instincts and senses to identify something dangerous, the online world does not have a parallel. We have to build that.""Speaking about state-sponsored cyber threats, she said they can sometimes be more focused and successful with capabilities to deploy large teams towards such activities. ""It's a question of who has more time. And, if you think about a well-funded nation state, may be they'll create a project, put 100 people on it, and they just work on that project throughout the day...So, they often know more because they have more time, not because they're smarter. I would say they're more likely to be successful.""On Gen AI and whether it aids cyber criminals too, Adkins said, ""There's no doubt that we're seeing an increase in tempo and sophistication of attacks... But I also feel that today, more than ever before, enterprises have better tools. If I think about starting a company 23 years ago, cybersecurity looked primitive then. Today, most of the solutions you're going to buy have security built into them. So, you're in a much better place than you were, say, 20-30 years ago. ""She said that Gen AI will give ""defenders"" a ""leg up"" over the threat actors. ""We will be able to leverage Gen AI to protect infrastructure in new ways that we've never thought of before and also at a speed that we've never been able to achieve before.""On India, she said govt here is ""very engaged"" on cyber safety. ""... it's a hot topic. They've done a very good job in getting involved quickly and partnering with companies. The workforce here and education levels in India are pretty high. There are parts of the world I go where they're just now starting to think about cyber security and they're much further behind India.""","Google security's heather adkins highlights the dual role of generative ai in cybersecurity.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has clarified that Ratan Tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted companies will go to his two foundations and not to his half-sisters and former confidant Mohini Dutta.The clarification comes after executors of Tata’s estate sought guidance from the HC on who would inherit the late industrialist’s equity portfolio. The June 16 order now paves the way for the probate of Tata’s will, which is expected in a month.While there was no dispute among the executors, some of them are also beneficiaries, and other heirs of Tata’s estate, originating summons were filed to address questions stemming from the effect of the fourth or final codicil on Tata’s will, the HC said in its June 16 order.The question at hand was whether Tata’s share portfoshares, valued at Rs 1,684 crore, have been explicitly mentioned in his will as being bequeathed to RTEF and RTET in a 70:30 ratio. The clarification is on his non-Tata Sons shares, worth over Rs 1,547 crore, which will now go to the two foundations in a 50:50 ratio.His non-Tata Sons shares include TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Investments, RNT Associates, Pritish Nandy Communications, as well as startups like Curefit, Avanti Finance and Electrodrive Powertrain Solutions (Electra EV).Additionally, he held foreign shares in Howmet Aerospace and Alcoa Corp, both listed on the NYSE.Some of his investments have seen significant growth over the years. For example, his Rs 16.9 crore investment in Avanti Finance, a company he co-founded with economist Vijay Kelkar and Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani in 2016, has grown to Rs 53.5 crore as of Sept 2024. lio will stand bequeathed according to clauses 4 to 8 of his will to half-sisters Shireen and Deanna Jejeebhoy, and Dutta, or whether it will be part of his residue asset and go to his two foundations, Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation (RTEF) and Ratan Tata Endowment Trust (RTET), as outlined in clause 13 of his will as substituted by the fourth codicil. The Jejeebhoy sisters are both among the executors and beneficiaries of Tata’s estate.The order pointed out that a testator can introduce alterations to his will through codicils and past Supreme Court judgments have established that codicils will prevail over the will. Therefore, Tata’s will has to be considered with alterations/additions made in the codicils.Justice Manish Pitale said Tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted shares, not specifically covered in his will, form part of his residue asset and stand bequeathed to his two foundations in equal shares.","The bombay high court has clarified that ratan tata’s holdings in listed and unlisted companies will go to his two foundations.
