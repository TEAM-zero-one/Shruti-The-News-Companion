NEW DELHI: Justifying its decision to ban online money games by bringing Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, Centre on Tuesday told Supreme Court that the unregulated online gaming sector had links with terror financing and money laundering, but said it was premature to examine validity of the law as it had not yet been notified after President's assent.In an affidavit filed in court on a batch of petitions challenging validity of the law, the Centre told the court that the Act was meant to protect individuals, especially youth and vulnerable populations, from the adverse social, economic, psychological and privacy related impacts of online money games and to safeguard the integrity of financial systems and security and sovereignty of the country.""Unchecked expansion of online money gaming has been linked to financial fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, and in some cases, the financing of terrorism, thereby posing threats to national security, public order and integrity of the state... There is enough material and data that indicates the unregulated online gaming sector has links with terror financing and money laundering, yet again establishing the exclusive compete-nce of Parliament to regulate the same,"" the affidavit said.It said data pertaining to money laundering and terror financing links to online money games were classified but agreed to place the same in SC in a sealed cover. ""An analysis of data from Suspicious Transaction Reports and Cross Border Wire Tra-nsfer Reports revealed online gaming companies registered in small island countries where user accounts were registered with Indian banks in the name of proxy persons.

Cardi B Turns Her Umbilical Cord Into GOLD!

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins. Lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and ginger are added to the raw placenta.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules.Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, reduced post-natal bleeding, lesser chance of baby blues, balanced mood and hormone levels, increased milk supply, lesser chance of post-partum depression, higher iron levels, uterus returning back to pre-pregnancy size faster, losing baby weight faster, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby.The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. The pills can be taken with other medications. The cost of encapsulation starts at $500. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.Mommy Made Encapsulation was founded by mother-of-four Juliane Corona in 2016. Juliane and her team have encapsulated for over 40,000 moms, including celebrity clients such as Brittany Nassif, Jacqie Rivera, Leslie Hernandez, Adizia Benzon, Andrea Espada, Brittani Boren, and more.",The grammy-winning rapper entrusted mommy made encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

MLB trade rumor: Kyle Gibson hints at surprising Nick Castellanos trade fit with a $2.55B NL Central club after Phillies cut his playing time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumor-kyle-gibson-hints-at-surprising-nick-castellanos-trade-fit-with-a-2-55b-nl-central-club-after-phillies-cut-his-playing-time/articleshow/125577803.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Kyle Gibson backs Nick Castellanos as a trade target for the St. Louis Cardinals during offseason

Nick Castellanos has become the hot topic in trade discussions after a tough season with the Phillies. He faced challenges at the plate, had issues in the outfield, and allegedly had disagreements with manager Rob Thomson. Then, Kyle Gibson, a seasoned pitcher for the Cardinals, threw out a daring idea on a podcast. He mentioned that the Cardinals might want to think about trading for Castellanos.Gibson highlighted that Castellanos offers leadership, experience, and a strong winning mentality, traits that would benefit the Cardinals' young lineup. The team is valued at $2.55 billion and can accommodate his $20 million salary, making this trade feasible. With the Phillies’ outfield getting crowded and Castellanos’ role diminishing, this deal could be advantageous for both sides. Gibson’s remarks transformed a rumor into a narrative that works for all parties involved.Gibson, who was an All-Star in 2017, joined the Cardinals on a one-year, $13 million contract before the 2025 season. He knows Castellanos pretty well from their battles in the NL East when he was with the Phillies and Nationals.During the November 24 episode of ""Cardinal Territory,"" a podcast that focuses on the Cardinals and is hosted by local media personalities, Gibson didn’t shy away from sharing his views on offseason targets.""I think a trade for Nick Castellanos could be an interesting one for the Cardinals,"" Gibson said directly to the hosts. ""You get a right-handed outfield DH bat, that could be interesting. Knowing Nick, how he is in the clubhouse as a veteran, I think could be good. (He has a) Really, really want-to-win type personality, and I know that maybe that's not the year the Cardinals could find themselves in, but I think it could be an interesting move. ""The clip quickly went viral, shared by the @CardTerritory X account with the caption: ""“Knowing Nick [Castellanos] and how he is in the clubhouse as a veteran... Kyle Gibson explains why Nick Castellanos could be an intriguing trade target for the Cardinals."" Gibson highlighted the less tangible aspects, such as Castellanos' leadership and motivation—traits that the former Rangers World Series champ (2023) thinks could help stabilize a young St. Louis team—rather than just focusing on the numbers.This isn't Gibson's first dive into trade discussions; being a 15-year MLB veteran, he's pretty open about how players fit into the roster. His remarks match up with the wider buzz, as MLB Trade Rumors placed Castellanos at No. 33 on their top 40 trade candidates list for the 2025-26 offseason, pointing out Philadelphia's crowded outfield and his contract coming to an end.Also Read: MLB trade rumor: Los Angeles Dodgers eye Emilio Pagán to fix bullpen issues after relying on Yoshinobu Yamamoto to close Game 7","Nick castellanos has become the hot topic in trade discussions after a tough season with the phillies.

What is Mat Ishbia's net worth? Billionaire faces explosive allegations in shocking Phoenix Suns ownership scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-is-mat-ishbias-net-worth-billionaire-faces-explosive-allegations-in-shocking-phoenix-suns-ownership-scandal/articleshow/125568144.cms,"Mat Ishbia is currently in hot water (Image via Getty Images)

Ishbia is a famous personality and according to a May 2024 Forbes estimate, his net worth is roughly $10.1 billion.

Fresh allegations deepen turmoil inside Mat Ishbia’s Phoenix Suns empire

Mat Ishbia, the owner of the Phoenix Suns, recently got into trouble. He reportedly made the news after two minority owners, Scott Seldin and Andy Kohlberg, filed a complaint against Ishbia. He was charged with financial manipulation, self-dealing, and fraud within the NBA team, according to a story published by the prominent media outlet The Athletic.In addition to being the chairman and CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), he owns the Phoenix Suns and Mercury basketball teams.Another round of legal action within the Phoenix Suns ownership group apparently began on Monday when two minority owners filed an explosive complaint. It accused majority owner Mat Ishbia of fraud, self-dealing, and manipulating team finances for his own gain.Ishbia allegedly used the team as his ""personal piggy bank,"" according to Front Office Sports. The Suns swiftly denounced this as ""a shameless shakedown dressed up as legal process."" The latest filing stated, via ESPN:""Ishbia does not own the Suns to make money for the company but he does operate it as a personal fiefdom for his own personal gain and for the benefit of his other businesses, including his mortgage company United Wholesale Mortgage...The reality is that Ishbia is using the Suns as his personal piggy bank, including through a lengthy list of conflicted transactions—only some of which the minority owners are aware of. ""The June 2 capital call, which is a regular obligation for ownership groups to contribute funds, is at the heart of the issue, according to the document. Scott Seldin and Andy Kohlberg, the minority owners, claim that Ishbia failed to meet the deadline he set and then made a covert attempt to conceal the failure from the other members of the ownership group.Additionally, the lawyers of the other two owners claimed in a statement to ESPN:“[Ishbia] has repeatedly abused his position as manager of the franchise to benefit himself—not the Suns.. We look forward to moving forward on an expedited basis and presenting our case to the court.""Ishiba has been under investigation because it was alleged that he concealed his spending information from Scott Seldin and Andy Kolhberg, the co-owners. Ishbia and his source of income is now facing questions.Mat Ishbia amassed his wealth by expanding his father's business, United Wholesale Mortgage. Through rapid expansion, cutting-edge technology, and a policy prohibiting brokers from collaborating with specific rivals, UWM emerged as the biggest mortgage lender in the country.In 2023, Ishbia acquired a majority stake in the Phoenix Suns. After an investigation by ESPN's Baxter Holmes revealed claims of racism and misogyny within the organization, he bought the team from Robert Sarver, the previous owner. Nevertheless, Ishbia or his representatives are yet to comment on the whole thing.Also read: Phoenix Suns vs Portland Trail Blazers (11-18-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","Mat ishbia, the owner of the phoenix suns, recently got into trouble.

Until recently, restoring these photos required hours of painstaking manual editing. Now Google Nano Banana Pro has made that process far easier. With the right prompts and a bit of creative direction, you can revive portraits, repair damage, and bring lost details back to life in a way that looks natural and polished. Whether you are working with a family album or a treasured vintage snapshot, this tool gives you professional level results with far less effort.Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction. In simple terms, it analyses each pixel, predicts missing details and rebuilds textures so the restored image looks authentic rather than overly sharpened. It also understands lighting, skin tones, shadows and colour balance, which makes it one of the most reliable tools for repairing vintage portraits. Instead of plastic-looking edits, you get subtle, human-like restoration that respects the original photo.The model also handles very damaged images. Torn edges, fold marks, grainy patches and faded backgrounds can be reconstructed automatically. For photos from the 70s and 80s, which often have tinted colour casts, the tool balances hues without making the image look artificial.Using this model effectively comes down to guiding it with clear prompts. Here are prompt structures that work well for damaged or faded photos:“Restore this old photograph with natural colours, clean details and accurate lighting. Remove scratches, stains and noise while keeping the original style.”“Reconstruct the face gently, retain natural skin texture, preserve original expressions and repair damaged areas without over-smoothing.”“Neutralise yellow tint, improve contrast, balance highlights and shadows, and restore film-like tones.”“Rebuild missing or torn sections, reconstruct textures, recover facial features accurately and maintain the vintage feel of the image.”You can also add extra artistic instructions such as “keep grain minimal” or “retain film quality”. The more specific you are, the more consistent the results.To ensure your restored photos look natural, keep these expert guidelines in mind:It is tempting to eliminate all grain, but older photographs naturally have texture. Leave a little grain to maintain the vintage character.For very old family photographs, match the restored colours with reference images from that era. For example, mid-century colour palettes often used softer reds and muted greens.Shadows anchor a photograph. If you remove too many shadows or highlights, the restored image may look flat. Let the model repair damage, but keep the original lighting structure intact.While the model handles most reconstruction automatically, sometimes background objects can appear too clean. Adjusting the prompt to “preserve background imperfections” can solve this.Many beginners make the error of giving vague prompts like “fix this photo”. This causes incorrect smoothing, unnatural facial features or oddly bright colours. Another mistake is using portrait prompts for landscape images, which can distort objects. Over-sharpening is also common, resulting in a digital rather than vintage look. Always compare the original and restored versions side by side to ensure the emotional tone remains the same. This helps you refine edits, preserve important details, and maintain the original atmosphere that gives the photograph its distinctive authenticity.Photo restoration is more than fixing pixels. It is a way of honouring memories that might otherwise fade. With Google Nano Banana Pro and the right prompt strategy, you can bring old pictures back to life while preserving their history and charm. A few careful edits and a well-structured prompt are often all it takes to rebuild details, refresh colours and revive treasured moments. If you have a box of old photographs waiting to be restored, this tool is a gentle and precise way to begin.","Google nano banana pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon has hailed nvidia as an unbelievable company.

Google Cloud is offering Ironwood TPUs to customers as part of its cloud platform.

Companies such as Anthropic have announced plans to use up to one million Google TPUs, citing performance and cost considerations.

What Buffett’s investment likely signals

Implications for the AI chip race





When Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, most observers initially viewed it as another major addition to Warren Buffett’s long-term portfolio. Yet the timing and strategic context suggest the investment could be more than a routine allocation. The world’s most influential value investor has chosen to back Alphabet at a moment when the company is strengthening its control over the hardware that underpins advanced AI systems.For nearly a decade, Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU, describing it as designed for demanding AI workloads, including large-scale model training and high-volume inference. This announcement was made publicly on Google Cloud’s official blog, where the company highlighted lower costs and improved performance for AI developers.Most AI labs still rely heavily on Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs.These GPUs remain the industry’s gold standard, but they are extremely expensive and often in short supply. This has created bottlenecks for AI companies that depend entirely on Nvidia for compute capacity.Google is in a unique position. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match without years of hardware investment. Analysts and industry researchers have suggested that TPU-based training may offer meaningful cost advantages compared to traditional GPU-heavy infrastructure, although exact ratios vary and are not always publicly disclosed.Buffett’s investment therefore can be understood not as a claim that Alphabet has overtaken Nvidia, but as confidence in Alphabet’s vertically integrated approach to AI. By controlling more of the stack, Alphabet potentially insulates itself from the price swings, supply constraints and dependence that characterise the GPU market.Nvidia remains the clear leader in AI chips and maintains a robust ecosystem of developers, tools and software support. Google’s TPUs represent a serious alternative in some workloads, but not a full replacement for GPUs across all use cases.The publicly available evidence shows:These developments suggest that the AI compute market may become more competitive. However, they do not confirm that Nvidia’s dominance is definitively weakened. Instead, they indicate that Alphabet is emerging as a strong hardware contender in a market previously dominated by a single supplier.Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosed stake in Alphabet was valued at approximately US$4.3 billion at the time of the filing. The filing does not state Berkshire’s motives. However, investors and analysts widely agree that Buffett’s approval of such a large position indicates confidence in Alphabet’s long-term strategy, including its growing emphasis on efficient AI infrastructure.Buffett has consistently favoured companies with durable advantages or “moats.” Alphabet’s traditional moats have included Search, YouTube and Android. In the AI era, Google’s control over its own chip design and cloud hardware may represent an additional moat that differentiates it from rivals.This does not imply that Google is attempting to dismantle Nvidia’s leadership. Instead, it suggests that Alphabet is building the capability to operate more independently in an AI-driven future, and that this capability may strengthen its competitiveness in cloud computing and AI services.The next phase of AI is likely to be shaped by which companies can train and deploy models most efficiently. If Google Cloud attracts more third-party training due to cost, performance and availability, it could gradually shift cloud market dynamics. Nvidia will remain central to the ecosystem, but Google’s TPU ecosystem adds a new dimension to the competition.Buffett’s investment amplifies the narrative that companies with deeper control over hardware, software and data will hold significant advantages in the years ahead. Alphabet is signalling that it intends to be such a company.The takeaway is clear: this is not the end of Nvidia’s dominance, but it may be the beginning of a more competitive era in AI hardware.",Berkshire hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in alphabet.

Tim Cook to reportedly retire in 2026

Tim Cook’s continued leadership

What’s next for Apple’s executive team





Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by financial times revealed that tim cook is planning to step down as soon as next year.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","Openai ceo sam altman acknowledges google's ai advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in openai's rapid progress.

Strategic impact









Oman is set to upgrade its aviation sector with a bold step into the future. The Sultanate will host Laila, a fully autonomous, hybrid-electric VTOL aircraft developed by California’s Odys Aviation, for its first Operational Launch Programme (OLP). The pilotless aircraft will take on real-world missions across deserts, mountains, and coastal regions, showcasing the potential of next-generation air mobility.Odys Aviation recently unveiled the full-scale pre-production prototype of Laila at its Long Beach facility. This pilotless VTOL aircraft features hybrid-electric propulsion, can travel roughly 450 miles (725 km), and carry payloads up to 130 pounds (60 kg). Once US testing concludes, Laila will be shipped to Oman for the OLP, a comprehensive programme designed to evaluate its technical performance, operational readiness, and integration with existing infrastructure.The OLP is a collaborative effort involving Oman’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MoTCIT). Signed last year, the agreement makes Oman the perfect testing ground for next-generation pilotless aircraft. Odys Aviation calls it the most thorough evaluation of its kind, putting every aspect of Laila’s hybrid electric capabilities to the testLaila’s autonomous capabilities, long range, and payload capacity make it versatile across commercial, civil, and defense sectors.In remote deserts and offshore oil fields, it can deliver essential tools, spare parts, and equipment in under three hours, compared to more than 36 hours by road. The aircraft can also monitor pipelines, ports, power plants, and other strategic infrastructure while transporting medical supplies and humanitarian aid to isolated communities in mountains, deserts, and coastal regions.Laila operates without runways or extensive infrastructure, allowing flexible point-to-point transport across Oman’s diverse and rugged landscapes. Its deployment aligns with Oman Vision 2040, enhancing national connectivity, accelerating logistics, and supporting sustainable regional development. Emergency and civil defense services stand to benefit from rapid-response capabilities, while the programme signals Oman’s readiness to lead in next-generation aviation technology.Odys Aviation highlighted that Oman was the natural first choice for the OLP and intends to expand the programme worldwide.
