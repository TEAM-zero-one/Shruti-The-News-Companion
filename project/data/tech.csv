The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its dubai hub from flights to and from india getting impacted by the expansion of air india and indigo.

NEW DELHI: India's flyer footfall is projected to more than double from the current 24 crore to almost 50 crore annually by 2030, which is more than the population of many countries, PM Narendra Modi said Monday while showcasing the country's aviation success story at the International Air Transport Association's 81st AGM here.Modi also said India's aviation ambitions included commercial space flights and integrating interplanetary journeys into civil aviation. While these will take time, the country is geared to make this a reality through its prowess in transformation and innovation, he said.PM Modi pointed out that India already had the most inclusive workforce in aviation with 15% of pilots being women, three times the global average of 5%. By 2047, the number of airports will expand to 350 - there are 162 currently in operation - while cargo is expected to increase from 3.5 to 10 million metric tonnes by the end of this decade.Another potential feather in the aviation cap is India becoming a $4 billion maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) hub by 2030, PM Modi said.""India should not be viewed merely as an aviation market, but as a value-chain leader.From design to delivery, India is becoming an integral part of the global aviation supply chain,"" Modi said, asking the aviation ecosystem to ""not just make in India but also design in India"".""We are working on a futuristic roadmap to maximise India's potential. In 2014, the country had 74 operational airports, which have now expanded to 162 and will increase to 350 in 2047. We are now the third largest aviation market globally. Our airlines have over 2,000 new aircraft on order,"" he said.Hosted by IndiGo, the global event is being held in India after 42 years.India had 96 maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities in 2014, which has since increased to 154. This is attributed to 100% FDI under the automatic route, reduced GST and rationalised taxation. ""India is more confident than ever before,"" Modi said, spotlighting ""big changes"" the country had seen since the time last IATA AGM was held. ""Today, India is emerging as a global leader in space-aviation convergence,"" he said.""There are three foundational pillars driving India's aviation sector: A vast market - not merely a collection of consumers but a reflection of India's aspirational society. A strong demographic and talent pool where young innovators are pioneering breakthroughs in AI, robotics, and clean energy. And finally, an open and supportive policy ecosystem which will take aviation to unprecedented heights,"" the PM said.The seamless Digi Yatra app for paperless domestic travel came in for special praise, with Modi urging other countries to adopt the same. ""Digi Yatra stands as a secure and smart solution, serving as a model of inspiration for the Global South.""He also spoke about the work being done in the fields of sustainable aviation fuels, green technologies and reducing carbon footprint.""The new Indian Aircraft Act aligns aviation laws with global best practices, ensuring a streamlined regulatory framework, ease of compliance and a simplified tax structure which presents a significant investment opportunity for major international aviation companies,"" he said.","India set to become $4bn mro hub by 2030, says pm narendra modi.

A comeback rooted in authenticity and quiet strength

Post-baby glow with purpose and presence





Supermodel Gisele Bündchen is back in front of the camera, and her return is nothing short of breathtaking. Just three months after welcoming her third child — her first with boyfriend Joaquim Valente — the 44-year-old icon is redefining postpartum beauty and proving that motherhood can be just as radiant as any runway moment.For the June/July 2025 issue of Vogue France, Gisele Bündchen collaborated with legendary photographer Mario Sorrenti in a dreamy editorial that blends ethereal fashion with emotional resonance. Draped in sheer lace gowns reminiscent of both Victorian elegance and forest fairy-tale magic, Gisele channels serenity, power, and femininity in every frame. It's a stark contrast to the high-drama fashion editorials of old, offering a softer, soul-rich vision of beauty.These images, which she described as part of a broader wellness message, aren't just about style — they're about presence. “To me, wellness goes far beyond physical health. It’s not just about what you eat or how you move, it’s also about how you feel, think, and live,” Bündchen shared on Instagram. “It’s in your thoughts, your habits, the boundaries you honor, and the inner peace you protect. True wellness is about embracing, honoring, and nourishing every part of who you are.This isn’t just a return to modeling for Gisele — it’s a reintroduction of the woman she’s become. After years devoted to raising her children with ex-husband Tom Brady, as well as helping co-parent his eldest, Bündchen’s latest chapter is one of empowerment and earned peace.“I feel more comfortable in my own skin and have a clearer understanding of my priorities,” she told Vogue France. “I’m grateful for where I am. I feel like I’ve earned it.”Even the glamour of hair and makeup felt like a personal reward. “Having my hair and make-up done makes me feel like I’m on vacation,” she joked, revealing that in the early weeks with her newborn, she “hardly brushed [her] hair.”With her baby boy — whose middle name is reportedly River — now sleeping through the night, Gisele says she’s finally regaining her rhythm. On Mother’s Day, she shared a glimpse of her “little angel” and opened up about “embracing the slower rhythms” of life.Also Read: “It was tough”: Tom Brady admits parental failures after public humiliation and split from Gisele Bündchen Whether she's wading through coastal waters or redefining wellness, Gisele Bündchen’s return is a powerful reminder that beauty, strength, and self-love don’t fade — they evolve.",Gisele bündchen makes a stunning return to modeling for vogue france.

What to expect at WWDC 2025

Swift Assist Updates – Enhancements to Apple’s developer tools.

On-Device AI Models for Developers – Apple may allow third-party developers to embed its AI models into apps, though these models are smaller and less powerful than OpenAI’s or Google’s offerings.

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next week. At the event the company is expected to unveil the latest versions of its iOS, iPadOS and macOS operating systems. Now a new report suggests that Apple may name the upcoming version of macOS as macOS Tahoe . As reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple’s upcoming macOS 26 is said to be named macOS Tahoe. The name follows Apple’s tradition of using California landmarks for macOS branding, with Lake Tahoe chosen to represent the new design overhaul expected in this release.Apple traditionally names its macOS operating systems after iconic California landmarks, a practice that has led to names like macOS Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina in recent years. Lake Tahoe, known for its clear waters and mountain reflections, aligns with Apple’s rumoured glass-like, translucent UI redesign. The update is expected to bring more fluid animations, redesigned icons, and a refreshed interface across Apple’s ecosystem. Lake Tahoe, a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, fits this naming convention perfectly.Alongside macOS Tahoe, Apple is reportedly rebranding all its operating systems to match the calendar year. Instead of iOS 19, macOS 15, or watchOS 12, Apple will introduce iOS 26 , macOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26, simplifying version numbers for users and developers.Despite the scaled-down nature of the event, Apple will likely introduce:","Apple is set to host its annual developer conference next week.

Powerbeats Pro 2 – Apple’s Most Powerful Workout Buds Yet!

Nothing is preparing to launch its next smartphone – Nothing Phone 3 next month. According to industry sources and company teasers, the phone is expected to bring design refinements and upgraded performance. While an exact launch date is yet to be confirmed, leaks and renders suggest Nothing Phone 3 will stick to the transparent rear design. However, subtle changes in the layout of internal components and LED glyph interface may offer a more polished look.In terms of performance, Nothing Phone 3 is expected to run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8-series chip. The smartphone is teased to offer a significant upgrade from the Phone 2’s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. Users can also expect improved camera hardware and AI-based software features, aimed at enhancing mobile photography and video.Nothing is also rumored to remove its Glyph Interface — the rear LED notification system. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Nothing shared a short video clip with the caption, “We killed the Glyph Interface.” The cryptic message has sparked speculation that the company may be overhauling or replacing the signature Glyph Interface—a key design feature of its previous smartphones—as part of its upcoming Nothing Phone 3 launch.The phone will likely run on Nothing OS 3.0 , based on Android 15, featuring a cleaner interface and better battery optimization. The handset is expected to have a 6.77-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. Nothing Phone 3 could house a 5,000mAh battery.Last month, during The Android Show: I/O Edition, Nothing co-founder Carl Pei hinted that the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 could be priced around GBP 800 (approximately Rs 90,000). This would mark a significant price jump compared to the Nothing Phone 2, which launched at Rs 44,999 for the base model with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.","Nothing is preparing to launch its next smartphone – nothing phone 3 next month.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected



iPhone 16e: 5 Reasons to buy the most affordable iPhone 16 series model!

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","Linkedin is laying off 281 employees across california, a report claims.

Could you own one?





A simple penny you’ve overlooked could be worth a life-changing amount. One rare 2001-D Lincoln cent has made waves in the numismatic world for an extraordinary reason: a minting error that combines the front of a penny with the back of a dime. This so-called “mule error” coin, produced at the Denver Mint, has sold for over $100,000 at auction. While it looks like an ordinary penny on one side, flipping it over reveals a design never meant to be there. If you have one, even in poor shape, it could still be worth tens of thousands.The 2001-D Lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the Denver Mint. While the front (obverse) of the coin features the usual portrait of Abraham Lincoln, the reverse side is where things take a surprising turn: instead of the Lincoln Memorial, it shows the reverse of a Roosevelt dime. This unexpected pairing of obverse and reverse designs is called a ""mule"" error—an accidental blend of two different coins.Only a handful of these coins are known to exist, making them incredibly rare. Experts believe fewer than 10 may have ever entered circulation. Because of this rarity, they’ve become highly valuable in the collector market. Even damaged or worn versions of this coin could sell for $20,000 or more.Four of these rare coins have already made headlines with their auction results:These figures reflect the coin’s growing demand and scarcity, especially among error coin collectors.Because these coins were unintentionally released into circulation, it’s possible—though extremely unlikely—that one could still be found in everyday pocket change. The key is to look for a 2001 penny with a ""D"" mint mark (for Denver) on the front, and then check the reverse. If it shows the torch, olive branch, and oak branch design found on a Roosevelt dime instead of the Lincoln Memorial, you may have something special.While the odds of finding this mint error are slim, it’s a reminder of how even small mistakes can create big value in the world of numismatics. So next time you empty your wallet, take a moment to inspect your coins—you might just be holding a $100,000 treasure.","The 2001-d lincoln cent mule error is a result of a rare mistake at the denver mint.

Final Word







The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residency permit that allows foreign nationals to live, work, or conduct business in the country without the need for a local sponsor. Initially introduced to attract high-value investors and top global talent, the visa is valid for ten years and is renewable. It enables recipients to enjoy greater stability and freedom, including the ability to sponsor family members, retain residency during extended stays abroad, and pursue business ventures independently.The visa is open to a wide range of categories. These include investors, entrepreneurs, skilled professionals (such as doctors, engineers, and scientists), outstanding students and graduates, and high-income earners earning Dh30,000 or more per month. The list also extends to creative individuals like artists and authors, and more recently, content creators and influencers under specific criteria. While each category has its own set of eligibility requirements, one of the most popular and accessible pathways is through real estate investment.Yes, property investment is one of the simplest and most direct ways to secure a Golden Visa. If you invest Dh2 million or more in real estate, you may be eligible—provided the investment meets several conditions.The property can be owned individually or jointly, and it may even be mortgaged, as long as the mortgage is from a UAE-based bank approved by the local authority. Off-plan (under-construction) properties also qualify, but they must be purchased from government-approved developers. A key requirement is that you also hold valid UAE health insurance for yourself and your family.Once you’ve purchased qualifying property, you begin by registering the ownership and obtaining a title deed from the Dubai Land Department or the relevant land authority in your emirate. You then submit your Golden Visa application through the Land Department, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), or via smart platforms like the Dubai REST app. Additional formalities include undergoing a medical fitness test and registering for an Emirates ID. If everything checks out, your 10-year Golden Visa will be issued and can be renewed as long as eligibility requirements are maintained.The biggest benefit is freedom. Holders of the Golden Visa do not need a local sponsor or employer to reside in the UAE, allowing them to live and work on their own terms. You can sponsor your spouse, children, and even domestic staff in certain cases. The visa gives you flexibility to travel in and out of the UAE without affecting your residency status. It’s also ideal for long-term business planning, property ownership, and lifestyle stability in a tax-friendly and globally connected hub like Dubai.There are plenty of alternative routes to the Golden Visa. If you’re a highly paid professional, a scientist, a top-ranking university graduate, or someone who has made exceptional contributions to the arts or sciences, you can also apply. Many of these routes require endorsement from relevant UAE entities, but the government has made efforts to streamline the process and attract global talent in emerging sectors.Yes, Indian nationals are fully eligible to apply for the UAE Golden Visa, and they are among its most prominent recipients. With a large Indian expatriate population already residing in the UAE, the Golden Visa offers a seamless pathway for investors, entrepreneurs, professionals, and students from India to secure long-term residency. Whether you’re purchasing property, earning a high salary, or qualifying through academic or creative excellence, Indians can access the same visa privileges as other nationalities—often with faster uptake due to their established ties and economic contribution to the Emirates.The UAE remains one of the top destinations for Indian professionals, business owners, and investors. Many Indians have already used the Golden Visa to secure a base in Dubai or Abu Dhabi, invest in real estate, and grow cross-border ventures. The visa is also an attractive option for expats from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Philippines—offering a secure and flexible alternative to short-term work permits and dependent visas.The UAE is fast becoming one of the world’s most attractive destinations for high-net-worth individuals, skilled professionals, and innovators. Whether you're an investor planning to enter Dubai’s booming real estate market or a professional seeking long-term security in the Emirates, the Golden Visa is more than a travel document—it’s a ticket to opportunity. To get started, you can reach out to the Dubai Land Department, GDRFA or travel consultants to help.","The uae golden visa is a long-term residency permit that allows foreign nationals to live, work, or conduct business in the country.

Overall volume is projected at 9%, driven by a robust 15% CAGR in the P&A portfolio.JK Cement (JKCE) reported better-than-expected results for 4QFY25, exceeding our estimates primarily due to a strong 15% YoY growth in volumes. Revenue/EBITDA/adj. PAT rose by 15%/37%/69% YoY. Management aims to achieve ~20mt grey cement volume (~12% YoY growth) in FY26. Of the ₹150–200/t cost-saving target, ₹40/t was realized in FY25; FY26 should see ₹25–30/t savings plus a full-year ₹75/t benefit.JKCE remains one of our preferred picks in the cement sector.We raise FY26/27E EBITDA by ~4% each on higher volume and better profitability of its UAE plant. We expect its revenue/EBITDA/profits to post a CAGR of 15%/20%/31% over FY25-27E.","According to motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting june 2, 2025) are radico khaitan and jk cement.

Expanded withdrawal purposes

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is set to revolutionize the way millions of employees access their provident fund (PF) savings. Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs, according to DD News.This major step is being implemented with the support of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and has already received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.Currently, PF withdrawals involve submitting online claims followed by a waiting period for approval from EPFO field offices. This process can take several days or even weeks. However, the upcoming integration with UPI and ATMs is expected to make settlements instantaneous. Members will be allowed to withdraw up to ₹1 lakh instantly—especially helpful in emergencies.“EPFO has made significant improvements in its digital infrastructure by integrating over 120 databases,” said Sumita Dawra, Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“These efforts have reduced claim processing time to just three days, with 95 per cent of claims now being processed automatically.
