Another day, another GTA 6 rumor ‚Äî but this time, it‚Äôs got a ""dev"" involved.

A Rockstar ‚ÄòDev‚Äô Suggests GTA 6 Is Still Set for 2025

GTA 6

I‚Äôm at a studio working on what will be 2025‚Äôs biggest release and we had celebration plans for releasing our reveal trailer which were completely thwarted when the trailer leaked the night before.

Fans Aren‚Äôt Buying It ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why



GTA

Obviously someone pretending to be an employee

I would guess that there's just a small group of executives that are deciding the release date, and there's a good chance they still have not decided if they are going to delay or not. I think most of the R* employees will find out the release date about the same time as the general public

Rockstar‚Äôs Silence and Crackdown on Leaks



GTA 6

So‚Ä¶ Is GTA 6 Really Dropping in 2025?

very

The buzz aroundjust got louder after someone claiming to be a Rockstar Games developer dropped hints about the highly-anticipated game still being on track for its 2025 release. But instead of celebrating, fans are side-eyeing the whole thing.After‚Äôs epic reveal at the end of 2023 ‚Äî giving us our first look at modern-day Vice City ‚Äî Rockstar has been unusually quiet. While publisher Take-Two Interactive insists the game is still scheduled for 2025, rumors of delays have kept swirling.Now, a supposed Rockstar dev added fuel to the fire in a since-deleted post, saying:The ‚Äúdev‚Äù also admitted that leaks, like the infamous pre-trailer leak last year, were a ""mood killer"" for the team ‚Äî even though Rockstar doesn‚Äôt officially discourage developers after such incidents.While the comment sounds juicy, manyfans are calling cap.‚Äù one user pointed out, doubting any real Rockstar employee would risk spilling secrets online.Another added, ‚Äú.‚ÄùBasically, fans think the release date is too tightly guarded for a random dev to casually confirm it on Reddit ‚Äî especially since Rockstar is known for keeping everything under lock and key.Since the trailer leak last year, Rockstar has been cracking down on leaks by bringing staff back into the office ‚Äî ending remote work for many.This move wasn‚Äôt exactly popular among devs, but it shows how seriously Rockstar is taking the situation. They clearly want every detail aboutto be on their terms, making it even harder to believe someone would just casually post about the release date online.At this point, it‚Äôs a waiting game. The 2025 release is still the official word, but with Rockstar‚Äôs silence and these sketchy ‚Äúdev‚Äù leaks, fans are keeping their expectations in check.Until Rockstar drops another bombshell, it looks like the only thing we can do is rewatch the trailer and count down the days to 2025 ‚Äî with acautious side-eye.Would you trust a supposed ‚Äúdev‚Äù leak like this?

Nvidia: How almost $600 billion wipe out in Nvidia market value has been proved Wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-almost-600-billion-wipe-out-in-nvidia-market-value-has-been-proved-wrong/articleshow/118604904.cms,"Nvidia's meteoric rise



Remember Mayhem Monday in January 2025, when the biggest AI success story $595 billion vanished from Nvidia‚Äôs market value wealth in just minutes. The almost $600 billion wipeout in Nvidia's wealth happened on the day frenzy over DeepSeek sent shockwaves in US and European stock markets. Other than Nvidia, other technology stocks including Google, Apple and Microsoft too lost billions. The launch and popularity of low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek rattled the technology industry. However, no company was as badly hit as Nvidia.Now it seems that the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly said that the market hugely over reacted. For, Nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the same period last year, and net income rising 80% to $22.1 billion. The company's data center revenue nearly doubled, contributing significantly to these results.At the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ""extraordinary"" demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips, which generated $11 billion in revenue this quarter. Despite concerns last month over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's advancements, Huang emphasized that reasoning models like DeepSeek's R1 require substantially more computing power, potentially up to 100 times more, underscoring the continued demand for Nvidia's high-performance chips.Looking ahead, Nvidia projects first-quarter revenue of approximately $43 billion, indicating sustained growth in the AI chip market. ‚ÄúWe will grow strongly in 2025,‚Äù CEO Huang asserted at the earnings call.Over the last two years, Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street. While Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.","N nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion.

Nick Emmanwori Shines at the NFL Combine with Record-Breaking Performance



South Carolina‚Äôs Nick Emmanwori has made an emphatic statement at the 2025 NFL Scouting Combine, solidifying his place as one of the most physically gifted safeties in recent memory. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound defensive back, known for his raw athleticism, wasted no time proving why he was ranked No. 1 on The Athletic‚Äôs Combine Freaks List. His exceptional display at Lucas Oil Stadium has not only cemented his reputation but also skyrocketed his draft stock ahead of April‚Äôs NFL Draft.Nick Emmanwori turned heads with a remarkable 11-foot-6 broad jump and an astounding 43-inch vertical‚Äîboth of which stand as the best marks recorded at this year‚Äôs combine. His vertical jump made history, as Warren Sharp of Sharp Football pointed out, marking the highest ever recorded by a player weighing at least 200 pounds. His 40-yard dash time of 4.38 seconds, accompanied by a blistering 1.49-second 10-yard split, showcased his elite speed.The towering safety‚Äôs performance was even more impressive when compared to previous standout defensive backs. The last time a player of his size leaped this high was in 2017 when UConn‚Äôs Obi Melifonwu posted a 44-inch vertical. In 2024, Tyler Owens of Texas Tech, who weighed 215 pounds, managed a 12-foot-2 broad jump with a 41-inch vertical before signing with the Washington Commanders as an undrafted free agent. However, Emmanwori's explosive numbers, combined with his versatility, make him a rare prospect in this year's draft class.While Emmanwori's combine stats have been eye-popping, his on-field production has been just as impressive. In 2024, he was a defensive force for the South Carolina Gamecocks, racking up 88 tackles, four interceptions, and three tackles for loss en route to earning first-team All-American honors. Over the course of his three-year college career, he accumulated 250 total tackles, six interceptions‚Äîincluding two pick-sixes last season‚Äîand 11 passes defensed. His ability to cover ground with elite speed and deliver physical tackles makes him a coveted prospect for teams looking to bolster their secondary.Despite being a former three-star recruit, Emmanwori has rapidly ascended the ranks and is now projected as a top-40 pick. NFL defensive back coaches at the combine have taken notice of his rare blend of size, speed, and playmaking ability, making him a strong candidate to be one of the first safeties off the board in April.Emmanwori himself knew he had something special to showcase at the combine. Ahead of his workout, he confidently predicted he could post elite numbers. When asked about his 40-yard dash expectations, he simply stated, ""4.3."" After delivering on that promise, he further expressed his belief in his uniqueness as a player: ""I heard a little bit of talks about being the fastest DB. I do think I am one of the fastest. Top three, maybe top five for sure. ... I don't think you've ever seen a safety like me. Well, there are a lot of dudes that came through this league, but a safety like me hasn't come through this league for a long time. My size, my speed, my ability.""Also Read: Looking Back at Tom Brady's 2000 NFL Combine stats: The start of an unlikely GOAT journey With a dominant collegiate resume and a historic combine performance, Emmanwori has positioned himself as one of the most exciting prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft .

Building a brand, one store at a time

Surviving the gymwear wars

From a grandmother‚Äôs sewing machine to a billion-dollar empire

At just 28, Ben Francis became Britain‚Äôs youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, Gymshark , skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation. Now, at 32, he‚Äôs setting his sights on an even bigger conquest‚ÄîNew York City.Later this year, Francis will open a sprawling 13,000-square-foot Gymshark store on Bond Street, a move he sees as crucial to the brand‚Äôs global success, reported the New York Post.‚ÄúI love New York ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the perfect place for Gymshark, and I‚Äôm honored to call it our North American home,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe have to be successful in the US in order for us to be successful around the world.‚ÄùFrancis built Gymshark online in 2012, capitalizing on the rise of fitness influencers and the e-commerce boom. But now, he believes physical stores are just as important as a brand‚Äôs digital presence.His first retail venture came in 2022 with a flagship store on London‚Äôs Regent Street. Dubai followed, and in late 2024, a Gymshark pop-up landed on Wooster Street in SoHo. That temporary store‚Äôs success gave Francis the confidence to commit to a permanent NYC presence.‚ÄúThe city has been so supportive of our brand vision,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople can finally see and feel the product we‚Äôre so proud of ‚Ä¶ I think physical brick-and-mortar stores are actually sort of a new and different way for us to reach people.‚ÄùUnlike traditional athletic apparel stores, Gymshark‚Äôs locations are designed as community hubs , featuring workout spaces, personal training sessions, and room for fitness events.The $25 billion gymwear market is fiercely competitive. While brands like Outdoor Voices and Olympia Sports have folded, giants like Nike and Lululemon battle newer players like Alo Yoga and Vuori for dominance. Gymshark, however, has carved out a loyal following with its sleek, performance-driven designs and strong influencer network.Francis credits Gymshark‚Äôs staying power to its community‚Äîone he built from scratch by sending free products to fitness YouTubers long before influencer marketing was mainstream.‚ÄúWhen I was getting into the gym, all the people I learned the most from were online on YouTube,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen Gymshark started, we ended up sending product to a few of my heroes at the time.‚ÄùSome of those influencers even received equity in the company, aligning their success with Gymshark‚Äôs meteoric rise.Francis, who grew up in England‚Äôs West Midlands, wasn‚Äôt an overnight success. He dabbled in multiple business ventures as a teen, many of which flopped. But when he started Gymshark, he had a clear vision: create gym clothes that were breathable, sweat-wicking, and odor-resistant.He learned to sew from his grandmother and stitched early orders himself. The brand‚Äôs rapid success was fueled by both its quality and Francis‚Äô transparency‚Äîhe let customers see behind the scenes of the business, building trust and loyalty.‚ÄúPeople nowadays are interested in the story behind a brand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey want to know who‚Äôs behind the scenes, who‚Äôs running it, and what the story is.‚ÄùNow, as he brings Gymshark to the heart of New York, Francis is betting big on a future where fitness isn‚Äôt just about working out‚Äîit‚Äôs about belonging.","At just 28, ben francis became britain‚Äôs youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, gymshark, skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation.

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries‚Äîa cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement. The label serves as a reminder to use the ""Lock Out/Control Lock"" function, which disables the heating elements when the range is not in use. LG has also provided an instructional video demonstrating how to activate this safety feature.","Health canada has issued a warning over certain lg free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs.

Who is Carl Feynman?

Carl Feynman , son of American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman , pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986. He found AI's rapid progress both fascinating and worrying. After seeing an AI create a cloth animation in minutes, he shared his thoughts on X, noting how quickly artificial intelligence is outpacing human effort.‚ÄúI‚Äôm outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?‚Äù Feynman posted, acknowledging how quickly AI models are mastering complex simulations that once required months of research and powerful computers.The conversation began when an X user shared their experience with Sonnet 3.7, an AI model with reasoning capabilities, which successfully generated an intricate cloth simulation in p5.js‚Äîa task that had stumped other leading AI models, including Grok 3 and o1 Pro.""Can you write the most intricate cloth simulation in p5js,"" was the prompt put by the X user.Recognizing the significance of this breakthrough, the user said: ‚ÄúWow, Sonnet 3.7 w/ Thinking just solved a problem no other model could solve yet.‚ÄùThe reaction by Feynman to the simulation quickly gained traction, with the user pointing out Feynman‚Äôs legacy: ‚ÄúThe man who literally invented modeling cloth in computer graphics at MIT in 1986 saw the video where Claude creates a cloth animation and says: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?‚Äô‚ÄùCarl Feynman, the son of renowned physicist Richard Feynman, made significant contributions to computer graphics by developing early methods for simulating cloth movement. His work laid the groundwork for realistic fabric simulations used in films, video games, and virtual reality. In 1986, his master‚Äôs thesis, ‚ÄúModeling the Appearance of Cloth,‚Äù was a pioneering achievement in the field.Reflecting on that time, Feynman noted: ‚ÄúIt took library research and cleverness and originality and months of work and days of time on big computers. Now I‚Äôm outdone by an AI in a few minutes.‚ÄùWhile AI continues to break barriers in computational creativity, Feynman‚Äôs words highlight an underlying concern: the speed at which AI is advancing, raising questions about the future of human expertise in fields that once relied on deep technical skill and years of experience.","Carl feynman, son of physicist richard feyn man, pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at mit in 1986.

US court says Byju‚Äôs defrauded lenders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-court-says-byjus-defrauded-lenders/articleshow/118640096.cms,"MUMBAI/BENGALURU : A US bankruptcy court has found Byju‚Äôs parent Think & Learn, Byju Raveendran‚Äôs brother Riju Ravindran and a little known hedge fund Camshaft Capital responsible for defrauding Byju‚Äôs term loan lenders.The court also observed that Ravindran violated his fiduciary duties as a director of Byju‚Äôs Alpha, a US subsidiary set up by the startup to receive the term loan proceeds which was eventually placed under the control of the lenders. ‚ÄúIn making its ruling, the Court confirmed that the multiple transfers of funds from BYJU‚Äôs Alpha constituted actual fraudulent transfers and conversion (i.e., theft),‚Äù the lenders said in a statement late Friday.The case pertains to the lenders‚Äô efforts to recover the missing $533 million, a portion of the loan amount they had extended the startup as part of the $1.2 billion term loan proceeds. The lenders have repeatedly accused the startup and Ravindran of hiding the money and refusing to disclose the whereabouts of the funds, seeking legal intervention to locate the same. ‚ÄúWe are gratified the Court unequivocally recognized that Riju Ravindran, Camshaft, and BYJU‚Äôs together conducted a deliberate fraud on a global scale arising from the theft of $533 million.

He later deleted the post a few hours after publishing it. Raveendran expressed his determination to prevent the company from entering corporate insolvency resolution proceedings (CIRP), stating, ‚Äúthose who come from nothing are never scared of anything.‚Äù He further alleged the existence of ‚Äúconclusive evidence of criminal collusion‚Äù between EY India, GLAS Trust, and the interim resolution professional (IRP) handling the case.",The case pertains to the lenders‚Äô efforts to recover the missing $533 million.

Tesla to open 1st showroom in Mumbai's BKC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tesla-to-open-1st-showroom-in-mumbais-bkc/articleshow/118640027.cms,"MUMBAI: Moving a step closer to its much-anticipated India launch , US electric vehicle maker Tesla has finalised a deal to open its first showroom in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex , in what is probably the highest lease rent for a commercial space.Property market sources said Tesla will occupy a 4,000 sq ft space on the ground floor of a commercial tower in BKC, where it will showcase its car models. The monthly lease rent is close to Rs 900 a sq ft, or around Rs 35 lakh a month. The lease agreement is for five years with Tesla expected to open a second showroom in Delhi's Aerocity complex. The lease was finalised just weeks after CEO Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, which was followed by a listing for 13 jobs in India, signalling a revival of the company's plan to enter the growing Indian market.The twin moves in February indicate that Tesla could be readying for a launch over the next few months by which time there will be greater clarity on the India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement, which was announced after Modi's meeting with US President Trump.While govt levies 110% duty on imported vehicles and Trump has flagged it as a concern, arguing that high tariffs are forcing Tesla to set up a plant in India. In a recent interview, Trump had said that if Tesla built a factory in India to avoid the country's high tariffs, it would be ""unfair"" to the US. ""Every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs... It is impossible to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India,"" he had said. Musk too has been pitching for lower tariffs and based on his feedback the govt even drafted a new policy.","Tesla will occupy a 4,000 sq ft space on the ground floor of a commercial tower.
