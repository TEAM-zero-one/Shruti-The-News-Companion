NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence may soon help doctors “read” the brain before disease becomes visible. An Indian team has unveiled MANAS 1, a Brain Language Foundation Model built on 60,000 hours of brainwave recordings from more than 25,000 patients, with the aim of enabling earlier detection of neurological and psychiatric disorders.Developed by Intellihealth (NeuroDx), led by neurologist Dr Puneet Agarwal, former Professor at All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, and his team, the model was launched during an AI summit and released as open source on Hugging Face. The project received computational backing under the Indian AI Mission of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.Unlike conventional AI systems, MANAS 1 is trained to interpret EEG signals — the electrical activity generated by the brain. Built with 400 million parameters, it is described by its developers as a foundational platform on which disease-specific AI tools can be developed.Dr Agarwal told TOI that MANAS 1 is designed to “understand the basic language of the brain.” He described it as a foundation model — similar in concept to ChatGPT — that learns from large-scale EEG data to interpret brain signals that traditional tests like MRI cannot fully decode.According to him, the model creates a platform on which AI tools for epilepsy, dementia and other disorders can later be built, while also helping researchers explore aspects of brain function that remain poorly understood.The public health argument is early access. India faces a shortage of neurologists and psychiatrists, particularly outside major cities. Brain disorders are often detected late, increasing disability and long-term costs. The developers say tools built on MANAS 1 could assist doctors at Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, community health centres and district hospitals in preliminary screening and timely referral. Any disease-specific AI model derived from the platform would require regulatory approvals before clinical deployment.If validated at scale, such systems could help reduce the gap between symptom onset and diagnosis — a critical factor in conditions such as epilepsy and dementia.A next-generation version, MANAS 2, is expected in the coming weeks.As artificial intelligence advances into neuroscience, MANAS 1 signals an attempt to move from analysing language on screens to interpreting the electrical language of the brain — with implications for research, diagnosis and access to care.","Manas 1 is built on 60,000 hours of brainwave recordings from more than 25,000 patients.

"Revised CAFE-3 draft tightens norms, may hit small car makers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revised-cafe-3-draft-tightens-norms-may-hit-small-car-makers/articleshow/128688732.cms,".

..

NEW DELHI: Manufacturers of small cars may face greater regulatory challenges if the revised draft of CAFE-3, which proposes to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, is implemented. The latest proposed modifications will support bigger vehicles, particularly electric and hybrid electric ones, people involved in the deliberations have said.With the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) issue remaining unresolved due to a tussle among car makers, the PM’s Office has intervened in the matter and roped in petroleum and heavy industries ministries in addition to road transport and power ministries to finalise the norms. This is the third draft of CAFE-3 in the past two years.CAFE refers to govt-regulated standards that mandate a minimum average fuel efficiency and maximum CO2 emission level for the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a car maker. Instead of checking individual models, it measures the weighted average of all cars produced by a manufacturer.As per the latest draft of CAFE-3, which has not been released yet, Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has proposed to do away with derogation (extra allowance) or relief for small car makers.It has introduced a Range-Extended Electric Vehicle (REEV), which would have the same Volume Derogation Factor (VDF) of 3 as for electric cars. VDF is a targetted govt measure to push the sale of less polluting vehicles like EVs, REEVs and hybrids.People aware of the latest changes said the removal of derogation for small cars is expected to raise the prices of entry-level petrol cars. They added that REEV has been introduced keeping in mind the current low penetration of EV charging infrastructure, range anxiety among buyers and uncertainty of battery life.There is debate over REEVs being treated on a par with EVs considering that unlike EVs, these vehicles have tailpipe emissions when the engine is running.People aware of the proposed policy said that as car makers would be discouraged from manufacturing small cars that meet the regulatory norms relating to CAFE, the gap in migration of people from two-wheelers to cars may increase.Going by the draft norm, new cars under the proposed CAFE-3 regime would increase costs by around 10% as car makers would have to add more fuel-saving technologies to meet the new standards or face penalties, industry executives said.","Latest proposed modifications will support bigger vehicles, particularly electric and hybrid electric ones.

"‘Journalism is first draft of history, Wikipedia second’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/journalism-is-first-draft-of-history-wikipedia-second/articleshow/128662426.cms,"For centuries, humanity has found itself caught between the promise of tomorrow and its perils when talking about the future. Socrates died a worried man because he thought writing will kill the quest for knowledge. It’s the same now with AI. How do you see this?

Broadly speaking, internet has made information a ‘commodity’. Do you think AI will make intelligence a commodity?

.

Wiki powered a huge number of Google search answers and is now emerging as a source layer for AI. Are LLMs both a threat and an opportunity to Wiki’s future?

■

You’re making the case really for human moderation of information.

Do you think that is where eventually the biggest problem with AI-curated information will lie, a wall that it cannot breach?

Like Google search in the past, AI companies have a frenemy relationship with news media — New York Times has sued OpenAI, for example. If AI systems increasingly cite original sources, should they be required to link back and share revenue or traffic?

.

How do we solve that?

Wikipedia has had this debate between deletionists and inclusionists. Which side are you on?

Tell us about your India community and volunteer group. There’s a perception or misperception, you tell us, that India pages are not as rigorous.

When people say, ‘Wikipedia is broken because it’s biased’, how do you react to that? And what’s your take on an AI-first competitor like Grokipedia?

How important is tone neutrality for credibility?

■

You launched WikiTribune to address neutrality in public discourse. Why did you not continue?

AI is fast changing the way information is created and shared, but speed and scale don’t necessarily mean credibility. Jimmy Wales , who co-founded Wikipedia — harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to upend traditional encyclopaedias like Britannica and become the internet’s default reference point — now finds it at the centre of a new debate on trust, including attacks from Elon Musk over alleged bias. Speaking to Rohit Saran and Saikat Dasgupta on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Wales reflects on the opportunities and risks AI presents, why neutrality is non-negotiable, and why trust is more important than ever■ John Philip Sousa (one of US’s most celebrated composers) believed people wouldn’t sing anymore when music began to be recorded. Chess, as a game, is more popular than ever before, even though the best chess player in the world is no longer human. It hasn’t stopped people from saying, ‘Oh, but we really enjoy playing chess!’ About AI, since the technology is so new, and so accessible, I don’t know. You ask a computer a question and it can answer, that’s incredible. But we also know it’s flawed. And then, there is this wild conjecture that it’s going to destroy all jobs, or no one will need to work anymore because we’re going to become vastly wealthy. Probably the answer, as ever, is somewhere in the middle.AI is obviously going to have a huge impact. What it will be is so hard to predict right now.■ All I can say is that right now, when we look at large language models — and I use them a lot, I’m a programmer, but not a very good one because I enjoy making things — it’s incredibly helpful and very fun. But it also makes things up and hallucinates. What I’m most interested in right now is, are there ways we can use this technology to support the community? Are there things that I can do pretty well? A lot of Wikipedia discussions are really long. You can get AI to summarise it. But here’s a key point, I want to read the original. It’s very useful. Another example would be you load up the Wikipedia article and all the sources and ask if there’s anything in the sources that should be on Wikipedia, but isn’t, or is there anything that’s not supported by sources. I did this and I think it is potentially useful for the community. Then say I want to write about a Bollywood movie that’s not globally famous in Wikipedia and I want to just get some basic facts about it. But I can’t read Hindi. Maybe the AI could help me a bit.We’re really about that human element, the human curated knowledge, the judgement. That machine translation might be a grammatical translation, but if you think about the cultural context of the reader, what they need to understand, what they are likely to know and what you need to explain to them, that goes beyond just the text. My example is, who’s the most famous cricket player? Today, it could be Virat Kohli in India. But if you’re writing for a global audience, you need to add a little text to explain who he is and put it in context. Machine translation can’t do that. But a human can.■ So, Gary Marcus is an AI researcher who has become known as kind of an AI sceptic, although I would say he’s not really an AI sceptic, but thinks that large language models have already hit a sort of wall — that we’re not seeing improvement on a lot of key issues like hallucinations. He thinks there needs to be some more fundamental breakthroughs. For some time, scaling seemed to make all the difference. But there are other experts of equal fame who disagree with them. Just watching that, I think, maybe we’re going to have a little bit of a break for a few years until there’s more breakthroughs where it’s like ‘okay, we’ve got this amazing tool but maybe we’re not that close to the next steps’.■ I think we’re going to have a big fight on copyrights. It’s going to be across legislatures and courts, rethinking how copyright law is structured. My concern is, we want to be careful about overreach. One of the classic principles of copyright law has always been that you can’t copyright facts. Some scientific publishers may be very excited to be able to say, you can’t use the facts unless you pay. And that’s a disaster. We don’t want to go there. That damages Wikipedia and our ability to say that on this date, this happened. Here’s the sources, and it’s five different newspapers. Also, newspapers don’t want to go there. One of the bigger, deeper issues is that local journalism has been wrecked. And that happened long before AI. For society, that’s a huge problem. I’m from Huntsville, Alabama, which is not a huge city, but it’s not tiny — 250,000 people. When I was a kid, I was a paper boy. I rode my bike and threw the papers (into houses). As a Wikipedian, the value of this is if I want to write about the history of Huntsville or the 1978 mayoral election, I’ve got a lot of good content to work with. But if I want to write about the most recent election? Very thin content. Because there’s just one afternoon paper now that’s published three times a week and from 100 miles away. And that means the first draft of history, which is journalism, isn’t being written. So, the second draft of history, which is Wikipedia, becomes much harder.■ I wish I had the answer to that. In some cases, maybe AI can help, if there’s some way to make it possible for one or two journalists to do more in a useful way that could be good. The changes in the information ecosystem have a lot of positives, obviously, but also some negatives. So go ahead and test.■ It has helped strengthen Wikipedia that we have this active, intellectual dialogue. I always say that I’m an eventualist, which is, we’ll probably get it wrong a lot but we’ll get it right eventually. The health of the Wikipedia community is important for us. Is the community having active discussions, having fun, behaving well? Are we doing things in a thoughtful way? I’m very comfortable with the debates as long as they don’t just become angry screaming matches.■ I find the Indian Wikipedia community to be very similar to everywhere in the world. A lot of nerds, not necessarily professionals in this field. There’s this guy in the global community with the nickname Hurricane Hank, who is a weather expert but not a professional meteorologist. The community has more men than women, unfortunately. That’s always something that we talk about. We want to improve that around the world. This is my third trip to India in a month and a half. On one of the trips, I was in Kerala, and I met with the local Wikipedia group. Among them was a couple, both Wikipedia editors, who brought their kids. On the second part of your question, I’ve not heard that about India pages. I do think it would be likely for the smaller language versions of Wikipedia. Obviously, those pages are typically going to be shorter and less filled in and less rigorous because there are fewer people doing it.■ See, Wikipedia is a source of knowledge, and sources are transparent things. One of the things that Elon (Musk) said is that Wikipedia just reflects mainstream propaganda. And I’m like, that’s really weird. Wikipedia reflects what reliable sources say. We cannot take one strange side, and say, ‘uh, we’re going to fight against all of scientific wisdom’, right? But we should reflect a debate if it’s a legitimate debate. Do we have biases? Well, of course, we’re human beings. So, we have to be really careful about that. Being neutral is one of the core values in the community. There’s no dispute about that. But do we always get it right? Maybe not. An old saying that I love is if you ask a fish about water, the fish will say, ‘What water?’ They live in it. They have no idea about it. And so oftentimes our biases are just there because we don’t know.Amartya Sen makes a comment in the introduction of his book, ‘10 Indians, 12 opinions’. That’s actually all humans — 10 humans, 12 opinions. Tone neutrality is very important for Wikipedia and for newspapers as well. I live in London and read two papers, Guardian and Telegraph. Guardian is a sort of centre left, Telegraph centre right. Both quality newspapers. I have an electric car, not a Tesla. I love electric cars and so I read a lot about them. If you cut out the headlines from those two papers, I can probably filter the information 90% accurately, because Guardian loves electric cars and Telegraph hates them. But because of this tone, I also trust both of them less because it feels like they are both campaigning. That’s a problem because it can reduce trust, not just with people who disagree, but even with people who agree with the tone.■ Tribune was an experiment to see if there was a way for journalists and community members to collaborate. What journalists can do, like you have come here in the middle of Delhi to chat with me, or go and report on something, or attend a press conference, or talk to a politician, that’s almost impossible to do as a volunteer. So, we explored some good collaborations. And then we would look at traffic stats every day. We had one story that had a really clickbait headline that I didn’t like. To make this into a commercial success, we needed more clickbait headlines. I didn’t want to do that. That’s how I realised the problem is not with journalism but that model, the broader ecosystem. The newspapers always love a good, juicy headline. There’s nothing wrong with that. But if algorithms are feeding people content to keep them around as long as possible, then that encourages more of the same kind of behaviour and so on. So it kind of changed my focus and was like, ok, good experiment.","Jimmy wales co-founded wikipedia, the internet’s default reference point.

Gaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.

As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content, and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.

I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.

Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.

Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.

We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.

Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO is retiring. The software giant has named another Microsoft executive Asha Sharma as the new Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Announcing the update, CEO Satya Nadella has sent an email to Microsoft staff where he said: “I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me”. “Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems,” Nadella said.In the message, Satya Nadella also praised outgoing Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.

Kazakhstan’s rare earth deposit reveals massive potential for clean energy and tech



Rare earth mining in Kazakhstan faces long timelines, high costs, and logistics challenges



Kazakhstan’s rare Earths’ grab global attention





Kazakhstan, mostly known for oil and endless steppes, has now suddenly made a discovery that might put it on the tech map. Under the Karagandy region, geologists reportedly found a rare earth deposit that could rank among the world’s largest. It contains neodymium, cerium, lanthanum, and yttrium, which you find in electric cars, wind turbines, and even smartphones.This discovery almost seems unreal. Experts say this could shift Kazakhstan from a transit hub to a serious player in high-tech supply chains. China’s grip might finally see some competition.Preliminary estimates suggest around 935,400 metric tons of rare earth oxides. Some informal numbers hint that the total ore body could be as high as 20 million tons, averaging 700 grams per ton. Locals have started calling the site “New Kazakhstan.” The minerals themselves are tiny in volume but vital for lean energy, electronics, and the military.Geologists stress caution. “To call it a deposit, you need a full study on hydrology, geomechanics, and economics,” said Georgiy Freiman from PONEN at the 2025 MINEX Forum. Exploration began in 2022. By late 2024, internal reports reached the government. Just before the EU–Central Asia Summit.Observers say it’s clearly a signal: Kazakhstan wants to show it’s serious about minerals. Not just oil, not just transit, but strategic resources too.Mining won’t start overnight. Some insiders say large-scale extraction might take until 2031. Investments could start around $10 million but that doesn’t include refineries or transport. Kazakhstan has no domestic rare earth refining. Partnerships will be essential. Tau-Ken Samruk, the state mining company, is reportedly leading technical studies with Canada’s Ivanhoe Mines. They’re testing “Typhoon” deep-detection tech.Foreign companies are paying attention. Over $1 billion in private investment flowed in from 2020 to 2025. Firms like Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue, and Barrick. South Korea’s KIGAM is also on site, using AI surveys to speed up exploration. China still dominates rare earths. Around 70% of output, refining 85%. That concentration worries many. Kazakhstan’s new role might shift the balance, even a little. Formal classification hasn’t happened yet. Environmental and commercial studies will continue into 2026. Officials haven’t confirmed licenses or refining plans.","Kazakhstan has made a rare earth deposit that could rank among the world’s largest.

Androgenic’s viral moment triggers “Fraudmaxxer” trend and Chadscan ranking drop





A short video has put internet personality Androgenic at the center of a heated online debate. In the clip, a stranger suddenly pulls the cap off his head during a public interaction. The moment exposed what viewers described as a receding hairline. Within hours, the footage spread across X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The hashtag “fraudmaxxer” began trending soon after. The video shows Androgenic speaking outdoors when a man from behind grabs his hat and runs. The influencer appears shocked and quickly chases after him.The clip has gained millions of views. However, International Business Times UK reported that it could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage. Even so, the damage to his online image happened fast. Androgenic is known in the self-improvement and “looksmaxxing” space. His content focuses on fitness, appearance, and what he calls male optimization. Because of that, many viewers felt the video challenged the image he presents online.After the clip went viral, reactions flooded social media. Some users accused him of hiding hair loss while giving advice about appearance.The term “fraudmaxxer,” a mix of “fraud” and “looksmaxxer,” was widely used in posts discussing the video.Others defended him, saying hair loss is common and should not define someone’s advice. Still, the criticism was loud. In certain online forums that rank influencers based on looks and status, users claimed his standing dropped sharply.One widely shared comment said he fell from a top position to much lower on the “Chadscan” ranking system, though those rankings are community-driven and not officially verified.Androgenic, who is believed to be based in Australia, has built a following of over 80,000 people on Instagram.His videos often include strong opinions about discipline, confidence, and physical improvement. He speaks in a direct style, which has helped him gain attention but also critics.So far, he has not released a detailed public statement addressing the viral moment. The debate continues across platforms, with some calling the incident unfair and others saying it reveals the pressure influencers face to look perfect at all times.The bigger conversation now is about authenticity. When someone builds a brand around appearance, even a small unexpected moment can change how people see them.

Why this matters?





The UAE has officially entered a new era of ""precision medicine."" Moving away from simply managing symptoms, Emirates Health Services (EHS) recently unveiled two ambitious gene therapy projects designed to strike at the root causes of autism and rare brain disorders.By leveraging genetic engineering, the UAE isn't just treating patients, it’s aiming to ""repair"" the biological blueprints that cause these conditions in the first place.The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children. These efforts mark a major shift from conventional symptom-based care to tackling the underlying genetic causes of disease, potentially transforming neurodevelopmental healthcare in the region.One key project focuses on genetic causes linked to autism and epilepsy. It is being developed in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), a world-renowned paediatric research centre.Scientists will work on enhanced gene delivery systems that target specific brain cells, which could:The project specifically includes rare conditions such as Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN), a disorder that often begins in childhood with autism-like symptoms and seizures before progressing to serious motor and cognitive decline.This strategy represents a major scientific shift because it aims to treat the root genetic causes rather than just managing symptoms.The second gene therapy initiative centres on neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers will explore methods to repair faulty genes and use advanced techniques such as:Artificial intelligence and data analytics will help researchers make sense of genetic information collected through national programmes like the Emirati Genome Programme, enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention for children at higher risk.This approach relies on cutting-edge technology and global expertise to refine treatment precision and open doors for future inherited disease therapies.Leading experts at EHS described the projects as part of a “strategic shift” in healthcare, moving from traditional care models to evidence-based, innovation-driven treatments that directly address the causes of genetic disease.Dr Issam Al Zarooni, Executive Director of Medical Services at EHS, highlighted that this direction aims to improve quality of life and local capabilities in advanced medicine and biotechnology.Meanwhile, Dr. Noor Al Mheiri, Director of Mental Health and Visiting Physicians at EHS, stressed that integrating scientific research with responsible clinical application is key to reducing the psychological, social, and economic burdens families face.Autism and rare neurogenetic disorders affect thousands of families globally and in the UAE. Researchers have long been exploring genetic and early diagnostic methods, including genome sequencing and machine-learning diagnostic tools, to better understand and detect these conditions.The new UAE projects build on this broader scientific momentum, offering hope for earlier, more effective, and personalised treatments that could one day change how conditions like monogenic autism and other brain diseases are treated.","Uae breaks new ground in children’s healthcare with cutting-edge gene therapy initiatives.

$12.8 million jackpot in limbo after Arizona store worker buys winning ticket – Court to decide who gets prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/12-8-million-jackpot-in-limbo-after-arizona-store-worker-buys-winning-ticket-court-to-decide-who-gets-prize/articleshow/128689616.cms,"



A worker at a convenience store in Arizona is in legal trouble after buying a lottery ticket worth $12.8 million from the store where he worked. A judge will now decide who should get the prize, as both the store and the worker claim it.A court complaint says the incident started on the evening of November 24, 2025, at a Circle K in Scottsdale. A customer asked for a replay of numbers for that night’s “The Pick” draw, 12News reported. The employee on duty, Robert Gawlitza, printed $85 worth of tickets, but the customer only paid $60, leaving 25 tickets on the counter.The complaint says the unsold tickets were left in the store overnight and were discovered the next morning intact. After learning that his store had sold the jackpot winner, Gawlitza reportedly checked the abandoned tickets and found the winning one. The winning numbers were 3, 13, 14, 15, 19, and 26.Gawlitza then finished his shift, took off his Circle K uniform and bought the tickets, including the winning one, from another employee for $10, according to the complaint.Store management was alerted and the ticket was taken to Circle K’s corporate office, where it is being held pending a court ruling on ownership.Circle K does not itself claim the ticket but has asked the court to determine whether it or Gawlitza is the rightful owner. In its filing, the company cited an Arizona Administrative Code provision that says retailers have rights to lottery tickets that customers leave unpaid and which remain unsold.A spokesperson for the Arizona Lottery said it was unaware of any previous dispute of this kind involving the state’s lottery.The $12.8 million jackpot is the fourth biggest “The Pick” prize ever sold in Arizona and the largest since 2019. The customer who originally bought the ticket has until May 23, which is 180 days after the draw, to come forward and claim the prize. Arizona retailers receive a 6.5 per cent commission on lottery sales and an additional $10,000 incentive for selling top prizes over $1 million.","Circle k employee robert gawlitza printed $85 worth of tickets, but the customer only paid $60, leaving 25 tickets on the counter.

'Bulls***t': Macron Slams Social Media's 'Free Speech' Rhetoric, Calls For Algorithm Transparency





NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives, accusing them of falsely presenting themselves as champions of free speech.Speaking at the AI Summit being held in the national capital, Macron said, “Some of them claim to be in favor of free speech. We are in favor of free algorithms, totally transparent.”“Free speech is pure bullshit if nobody knows how you are guided through this,"" Politico quoted him saying.“All the algorithms have biases, we know that. There is no doubt. And they are so impactful, when you speak about social media, that having no clue about how the algorithm is made, how it is tested and where it will guide you — the democratic biases of this could be huge,” he added.Over the past decade, European Union lawmakers in Brussels have rolled out sweeping legislation aimed at curbing the power of major technology platforms. Landmark measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act were designed to strengthen privacy protections, rein in anti-competitive behavior and impose stricter obligations on content moderation. Washington, however, has framed elements of these laws as incompatible with US constitutional protections for speech.The dispute has since widened into a broader political clash, with American officials and several tech companies warning that Europe’s rules verge on censorship. European leaders counter that the regulations are necessary to tackle illegal content, disinformation and platform abuses.Among the most vocal has been Macron, who has repeatedly called for tighter limits on social media access for younger users — a stance that is gaining traction across parts of Europe as public concern over online harms intensifies.","French president emmanuel macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives.

Smart Pigeon Triggers Zamzam Cooler on Its Own (Representative Image)

Why the humble pigeon struck a chord across the Internet



A broader context: Birds in Mecca



Public reaction and social media buzz







A delightful and unexpected video from Mecca has captured global attention after showing a smart pigeon placing its body on a water cooler sensor to dispense Zamzam water, the sacred water sourced from the historic well within the Grand Mosque and then calmly drinking from it. The clip, shared widely on social media platforms, shows worshippers and pilgrims pausing to record the unusual moment with their phones as the bird figures out how to activate the sensor-based dispenser and enjoy a refreshing drink in the holy city.The moment, which has sparked widespread online interaction and admiration, prompted one social media user to comment: “سبحان من علمها هذا”, meaning “Glory be to He who taught her this.” The video resonated with many viewers not just because of its novelty but also for its symbolic alignment with the spirit of Mecca, where pilgrims from around the world gather to perform Umrah and offer prayers.In Islam, Zamzam water holds deep spiritual significance; it is believed to be a blessing from God, sprung miraculously for Ishmael and Hagar centuries ago and now an integral part of worship in Mecca, especially during Umrah and Hajj.While pilgrims drink Zamzam for both refreshment and blessing, the sight of a bird independently accessing this revered water from an electronic dispenser captured many hearts.Coolers and dispensers for Zamzam water are strategically placed around the Masjid al-Haram and other holy sites to ensure pilgrims remain hydrated, especially under the desert sun. Saudi authorities have long modernised the process of distributing Zamzam water, using advanced filtration, cooling systems and automated dispensers, to serve millions of visitors safely each year, alongside strict hygiene measures and quality control.The video’s appeal was two-fold: on one hand, viewers were amused at the pigeon’s instinctive problem-solving, and on the other, many interpreted the bird’s action as a small, tender moment of nature interacting with sacred service infrastructure in one of the world’s most visited religious sites.Mecca is home to abundant birdlife, especially pigeons that have become a familiar sight around the Grand Mosque and its surroundings. Known locally as حمام الحرم (pigeons of the Haram), these birds are often photographed by pilgrims and visitors commonly feed seeds to flocks as part of their experience in the holy city. Their presence has cultural resonance: many consider them a benign, peaceful part of the spiritual environment and it is religiously discouraged to harm or capture them.Yet this particular video went beyond simple birdwatching it showcased an unexpected level of interaction with human-oriented technology in a sacred environment, making it stand out among countless typical clips of pilgrims and pigeons.The video quickly spread across social platforms including X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Instagram, with users around the world reacting in a mix of amusement, admiration and spiritual reflection. Many praised the pigeon’s intelligence, calling it a “clever bird,” while others shared comments that blended humour with faith-based awe at nature’s ingenuity.Some commentators saw a symbolic layer in the clip, a simple creature accessing life-sustaining water in a holy context and shared it alongside spiritual messages or reflections on divine provision, especially resonating during periods like Ramadan when acts of kindness, mercy and reflection are emphasised.Though light-hearted on the surface, the video’s popularity highlights several broader themes. The pigeon navigating a technological sensor bridges urban wildlife behaviour with modern infrastructure. In a world saturated with content, stories tied to places of deep cultural and religious significance, like Mecca, naturally draw extra attention.Universal appeal of animal intelligence: Across cultures, moments where animals demonstrate problem-solving or unusual behaviours quickly become social media sensations.

Why Jazeera Airways' ‘Fly Now, Pay Later’ matters for travellers

No Cash Upfront? Jazeera Airways Launches Game-Changing Payment Option

A broader digital transformation in aviation



What it means for the future of travel



Budget Tight? This Kuwaiti Airline Lets You Split Your Flight Bill





In a major move set to reshape travel affordability in the Gulf, Jazeera Airways has become the first Kuwait i airline to introduce a “Fly Now, Pay Later” payment option, enabling passengers to book flights and pay for them in manageable installments rather than one lump sum. The innovative feature, launched on February 21, 2026, comes through a strategic partnership with deema, Kuwait’s first licensed Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) fintech provider and represents a significant advancement in digital travel services in the region.The new system allows travellers booking through the airline’s website or mobile app to choose a deferred payment plan that splits the total ticket cost into two to four interest-free installments, all processed in Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD). An instant eligibility check at checkout makes the process seamless, with passengers receiving approval and booking confirmation quickly before paying off the balance over time. The airline still receives the full payment upfront via deema, which manages customer collection and ensures operational liquidity for the carrier.This BNPL solution is more than a payment gimmick, it addresses a real hurdle for many consumers: the upfront cost of flights, which can be a barrier to travel for families, students, freelancers and lower-income wage earners.By spreading payments, passengers can secure today’s prices and avoid fare increases while managing cash flow more predictably. The option also taps into a broader global trend of flexible travel payment plans, where airlines and fintech companies collaborate to make experiences more budget-friendly, similar to Flair Airlines’ Flex Pay and WestJet’s Flex Pay programs in other markets.For many in the GCC, where travel demand is high and disposable income is often tied to monthly budgeting, this kind of flexibility resonates strongly. It opens doors for passengers who might otherwise delay or forgo travel due to immediate budget constraints and aligns with digital consumer preferences that favour agility and convenience.Officials at Jazeera Airways described the rollout of the “Fly Now, Pay Later” feature as part of a broader digital transformation strategy designed to enhance the customer experience and keep pace with evolving expectations from tech-savvy travellers. By partnering with a local fintech leader like deema, the airline has demonstrated an ability to swiftly integrate cutting-edge financial solutions into its booking ecosystem, a move that could influence other carriers in the region to adopt similar models.Barathan Pasupathi, CEO of Jazeera Airways, highlighted that this initiative isn’t just about adding another payment option but about fundamentally lowering barriers to travel and making flying more inclusive and attainable for a broader segment of the population. Meanwhile, deema’s leadership has emphasised the innovation’s potential to advance Kuwait’s fintech ecosystem by showcasing how local technology can support major commercial sectors like aviation.The introduction of the “Fly Now, Pay Later” option arrives at a time when the travel industry continues to rebound from pandemic disruptions and grapples with ongoing economic pressures that influence consumer behaviour. Flexible payment plans like this reflect a larger shift in how airlines think about customer affordability, loyalty, and access. Rather than competing solely on low fares or route networks, carriers are increasingly differentiating themselves through payment convenience and financial ease.Other airlines like Canadian Flair Airlines and WestJet have introduced similar flexible payment plans to make booking more accessible for budget travellers. Experts suggest that if flexible financing gains traction, it could become a standard feature of airline booking platforms, particularly for low-cost carriers and regional airlines competing for price-sensitive travellers. It could also signal a move toward more customer-centric service models in the Middle East and beyond, where aviation and fintech intersect to enhance travel accessibility.Jazeera Airways has launched a ‘Fly Now, Pay Later’ payment option via deema, becoming the first airline in Kuwait to do so. The feature lets passengers split flight payments into interest-free installments, improving accessibility and budgeting ease. This move aligns with global trends of flexible airline payment plans and reflects broader digital transformation in aviation. The partnership with a local fintech player strengthens Kuwait’s digital economy and positions the airline as a customer-centric innovator.","Jazeera airways has become the first kuwaiti airline to introduce a “fly now, pay later” payment option.

It seeks to mobilise large-scale funding to support long-term solutions to child hunger rather than short-term relief.The campaign’s target is a minimum of AED1 billion. Funds raised will be invested in sustainable programmes designed to prevent and treat malnutrition among children in vulnerable communities across the world.The initiative builds on a long-standing humanitarian vision championed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Efforts to combat hunger are viewed as a continuing moral responsibility rather than a response to a temporary emergency.The campaign operates under the umbrella of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives. It has attracted participation from individuals, institutions and businesses, reflecting the UAE community’s culture of giving and its commitment to supporting humanitarian projects that serve underserved populations globally.To ensure effective implementation, the campaign is organised in partnership with UNICEF, Save the Children, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and Action Against Hunger. These organisations provide expertise and operational capacity to deliver measurable impact on the ground.The number 11.5 associated with the campaign refers to the mid-upper arm circumference measurement used to detect acute malnutrition in children aged between six months and five years.According to World Health Organisation guidelines, a measurement below 11.5 centimetres is among the indicators used to diagnose severe acute malnutrition. The campaign highlights this figure to underline the urgency of early detection and intervention.The campaign continues to welcome donations through seven main channels.Contributions can be made via the official website at www.edgeoflife.ae or through the toll-free call centre number 800 4999.Bank transfers in UAE dirhams can be directed to the campaign account at Emirates Islamic Bank using IBAN AE940340003708472909222.Donations can also be sent by SMS by texting the word “LIFE” to du and e& numbers: 1034 to donate AED10, 1035 for AED50, 1036 for AED100 and 1038 for AED500.Additional platforms include the DubaiNow app, YallaGive.com under the “Donations” tab and Dubai’s community contributions platform Jood at Jood.ae.With significant backing already secured, the campaign continues to gather support as it works towards its goal of protecting millions of children from hunger.","Anonymous philanthropist donates aed35 million to 'edge of life' campaign fighting childhood hunger.

Zero Tariffs, Massive Market: How India-EU Deal Could Push India Past Bangladesh In Textiles

The reduction of US reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 25 per cent to 10 per cent is expected to significantly improve the competitiveness of labour-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, engineering goods, textiles, and gems and jewellery in the American market, industry representatives said.The development follows a US Supreme Court ruling that struck down sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, dealing a setback to a key pillar of his economic agenda for a second term.In a 6–3 verdict authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the tariffs imposed on multiple countries were illegal and that the president had exceeded his authority in introducing the levies.Subsequently, the US announced through a proclamation a temporary import surcharge of 10 per cent ad valorem on articles imported into the country for 150 days starting February 24.The sectors affected had earlier been subject to reciprocal tariffs of 25 per cent in the US market.The US remains a major export destination for these industries, and the tariff reduction is expected to provide a boost to outbound shipments, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General Ajay Sahai said, PTI reported.A leather exporter said the move would make Indian products more competitive in the US market.However, Sahai noted that Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium and certain automobile products continue to remain a constraint.“India should leverage this improved position to expand market share while pursuing trade negotiations for greater stability and sectoral relief,” he added.On whether India should reassess its trade negotiations with the US, Sahai said the proposed pact goes beyond tariff concessions on goods alone.“A trade agreement would help tariff concessions or exclusions, provide long-term predictability and prevent re-imposition through alternate US legal routes... However, both sides may recalibrate negotiations in light of the changed tariff environment,” he said.He added that the tariff ruling creates an opportunity to pursue a more balanced and rules-based trade framework instead of one driven by unilateral tariff actions.During 2021–25, the US remained India’s largest trading partner in goods. The US accounts for about 18 per cent of India’s total exports, 6.22 per cent of imports and 10.73 per cent of overall bilateral trade.In 2024–25, India–US bilateral trade reached $186 billion, including $86.5 billion in exports and $45.3 billion in imports.","The reduction of us reciprocal tariffs on indian goods from 25 per cent to 10 per cent is expected to significantly improve the competitiveness of labour-intensive sectors.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

In a sweeping reset during Xbox’s 25th anniversary year, Satya Nadella-led Microsoft has named Asha Sharma as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, pitching another Indian-American into a leadership position at a time of intense xenophobia in MAGA circles. Wisconsin-born Sharma, 43, succeeds Phil Spencer, the widely admired Xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.Sharma, who has wheeled though Instacart and Meta among other companies as a senior executive, most recently served as President of CoreAI at Microsoft, where she led efforts to embed advanced models into the company’s cloud and developer stack. Before returning to Microsoft, where she had an earlier stint, Sharma was Chief Operating Officer at Instacart, helping steer the delivery platform through its IPO and a volatile post-pandemic reset. Earlier, at Meta, she oversaw product and engineering for Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct, guiding communications products used by billions.A graduate of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, Sharma’s resume reads like a map of the modern tech economy: marketplaces, social platforms, cloud, and AI. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella praised her “deep experience building and growing platforms,” signaling that the company sees operational discipline and AI integration as critical to Xbox’s next chapter.The appointment immediately ignited debate across gaming forums and social media, with critics arguing she lacks direct experience in game development at a moment when Microsoft Gaming faces declining revenues and the complex integration of the $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. Fans accustomed to Spencer’s gamer-first persona questioned whether an “AI specialist” might privilege algorithms over artistry.Sharma moved quickly to address the concerns in her first memo to staff and in an interview with Variety, acknowledging she has “a lot to learn” about the creative side of the business and vowed to “earn the right to be trusted.” She promised a “return of Xbox,” insisting the company would not chase short-term efficiencies or flood the ecosystem with what she called “soulless AI slop.” Games, she wrote, “are and always will be art, crafted by humans. ”Sharma’s elevation places her among a cadre of Indian-American leaders running major US tech companies, including Nadella at Microsoft and Sundar Pichai at Alphabet/Google, whose subsidiary YouTube is also helmed by Indian-American Neal Mohan. For many, it is another milestone in the continued ascent of Indian-origin executives in Silicon Valley who remain uninhibited in the face of MAGA paranoia.Still, the appointment has unfolded in a fraught political moment. Online, some MAGA-aligned voices have recycled claims of corporate nepotism and “favoring their own,” casting Sharma as part of an “Indian tech-bro” archetype. The backlash comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over H-1B visas and the ""America First"" movement, even as Sharma’s background remains firmly rooted in the American Midwest; she was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, and built her career through mainstream US institutions and companies.Industry observers say the backlash reflects broader anxieties—about globalization, immigration, and the dominance of tech—rather than Sharma’s credentials. “In this era, a gaming CEO needs to protect creatives while navigating AI and scale,” one analyst wrote on Reddit. “You don’t need to be a hardcore gamer; you need to be a platform architect.”Microsoft Gaming is valued at roughly $80 billion and spans consoles, PC, cloud gaming, and a portfolio of studios that now includes Activision Blizzard. The mandate before Sharma is formidable: stabilize revenue, extract value from blockbuster acquisitions, and define how AI augments—rather than supplants—creative work.","Asha sharma, 43, succeeds phil spencer, the widely admired xbox chief who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company.

Axis Bank not in race to acquire CreditAccesss Grameen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/axis-bank-not-in-race-to-acquire-creditaccesss-grameen/articleshow/128697424.cms,"MUMBAI: Axis Bank has said that it is not in the race to acquire CreditAccess Grameen which has been put on the block by promoters, denying market reports that it had submitted a bid for a controlling stake in the microfinance lender.In a stock exchange filing dated February 22, 2026, the bank said it had received queries regarding bidding for a stake in CreditAccess Grameen. “The Bank has neither submitted nor is planning to submit, any bid for a stake in CreditAccess Grameen Limited,” it said. The bank added that there was no material event requiring disclosure under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and that it would continue to comply with disclosure norms.The clarification follows reports in early February that Axis Bank had bid for the 66.28% promoter stake in CreditAccess Grameen, a move that could have made the microfinance institution a wholly owned subsidiary. The bank denied any such bid or plans between Feb. 21 and 22.CreditAccess Grameen’s promoter, CreditAccess India BV, holds about 66.28% to 66.43% in the company. The Netherlands-based entity is backed by investors including Olympus Capital Asia, which holds around 15%, and the Asian Development Bank, which owns about 9%, along with high-net-worth individuals.The remaining shares are held by institutions such as mutual funds, which own about 18%, and other investors with roughly 11%.Promoters began exploring a stake sale around October 2025, marking a second attempt after an earlier process in 2024 was halted amid stress in the microfinance sector. The proposed transaction is aimed at providing an exit to long-term investors as the fund approaches the end of its life. Bank of America is advising on the sale process. The deal is said to seek a valuation of about 2.6 times price-to-book, translating into roughly Rs 14,000 crore, though reports suggest that initial interest from banks has not translated into many bids.CreditAccess Grameen, India’s largest standalone NBFC-MFI with assets under management of over Rs 26,000 crore, has been seen as a strategic fit for banks seeking to improve net interest margins and meet priority sector lending targets. Reports had suggested that an acquisition by Axis Bank could have helped address its sub-4% net interest margins and priority sector lending shortfall in the third quarter of FY26. The proposed structure was seen as similar to IndusInd Bank’s acquisition of its microfinance arm, allowing separate operations under the bank’s ownership.The company traces its origins to Grameen Koota Financial Services, founded in 1991 in Karnataka by Alatur Ravindra and Udaya Kumar Hegde. It later evolved into CreditAccess Grameen after a merger and listing, with CreditAccess India BV established as a professional investment vehicle backed by more than 250 shareholders to drive growth.",Axis bank denies market reports that it had submitted a bid for a controlling stake in the microfinance lender.
