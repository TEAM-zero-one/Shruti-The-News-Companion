Viral post claims 3 H-1B visa holders were denied entry to US for staying in India over 60 days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/viral-post-claims-3-h-1b-visa-holders-were-denied-entry-to-us-for-staying-in-india-over-60-days/articleshow/122026338.cms,"A viral post claimed 3 H-1B visa holders were denied entry to the US as they spent over 60 days in India.

A Thread post shared the incident of 3 H-1B visa holders denied entry to the US.





A viral social media post claimed that three Indian nationals reportedly were denied entry to the US after they flouted the rules and stayed in India for over 60 days. A message posted on the Threads narrating the situation of these three H-1B visa holders is doing the rounds, after they were stopped at Abu Dhabi immigration and their visas were revoked. The post has triggered a debate among the H-1B community as many doubted that this was fake and their entry must have been restricted for some other reason.According to the viral post, all three of them had proof of emergency and approval emails from the company and attorney, but still, they were sent back. One stayed for two months and 27 days, while the other two stayed in India for over three months.""Very sorry to hear this. Just now, three H1B holders messaged me from Abu Dhabi Airport. They were denied entry and had their H1B visas cancelled for staying in India beyond 60 days — one stayed 2 months 27 days, the others over 3 months. They’re now waiting for flights back — one to Bangalore, two to Hyderabad. Even with employer letters and emergency proof, CBP still revoked their visas under 22 CFR 41.122(h)(3),"" the message read.""There is no need to be india for 3months if you are working in USA,"" one user wrote.The same post on Reddit was taken down. One Redditor claimed that there is no such rule as long as the visa and the employment remain valid. ""Something doesn’t seem right here. As an Indian passport holder on an H1B visa — which is a non-immigrant, temporary worker visa — you are allowed to stay outside the U.S. for an extended period, as long as your visa and employment remain valid,"" the user wrote.""There is no specific law that restricts H1B holders from being outside the US for more than 60 days. It appears the immigration officers may not have followed proper guidelines in this case, and the decision to deport these individuals seems questionable,"" the user added.","A viral post claimed 3 h-1b visa holders were denied entry to the us as they spent over 60 days in india.

Islanders may trade Noah Dobson as Red Wings enter talks with major offer

Noah Dobson’s contract demands could be the trade tipping point

NHL trade rumors are heating up as the Detroit Red Wings reportedly make a push for Islanders defenseman Noah Dobson. With the 25-year-old entering restricted free agency and seeking a major payday, the Islanders may be open to moving him—and Detroit is among the first teams to inquire. Reports suggest the Red Wings have offered a package including J.T. Compher, Jonatan Berggren, and draft picks. A potential deal could shake up both teams’ blue line plans heading into the 2025 season.Following earlier reports by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman that the Islanders were exploring the trade market for their top blueliner, more specifics are starting to surface. According to Stefen Rosner of The Hockey News, Detroit has formally inquired about Noah Dobson’s availability, and they’ve already floated a package in hopes of landing the 25-year-old restricted free agent.Stefen Rosner confirmed the interest via X (formerly Twitter), noting, “The Detroit Red Wings have inquired about New York Islanders pending restricted free agent defenseman Noah Dobson. Reporter Bob Duff cites that Elliotte Friedman stated that Detroit's offer includes forwards J.T. Compher and Jonatan Berggren, with draft picks also likely being part of the discussion.”If accurate, the Red Wings' offer appears to balance veteran experience with young potential—a strategy GM Steve Yzerman has leaned into during Detroit’s rebuild.But whether it will be enough to entice the Islanders to part with their top-pairing defenseman is far from certain.Dobson is coming off the final year of a three-year, $12 million extension signed in 2022 and is now a pending RFA. What’s fueling the trade buzz even more is his rumored contract ask.According to Frank Seravalli of Daily Faceoff, “We mentioned his initial ask was $11 million per season, which will obviously come in quite lower on the next new deal… But will it be on the Island?”Currently, only Erik Karlsson, Drew Doughty, and Rasmus Dahlin make $11 million or more per year among NHL defensemen. While Dobson has flashed elite offensive upside—scoring 70 points while logging 23 minutes per game—his price tag and the Islanders’ recent draft lottery win may force GM Mathieu Darche to make a bold decision.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Connor McDavid’s Stanley Cup Final struggle may be pushing him toward change Nothing is finalized yet, but the pieces are in motion.

With the ongoing wave of layoffs, fear of AI-driven job losses ripple through the professionals around the globe, however, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky is suggesting a more balanced perspective. He emphasises that AI will undoubtedly bring ‘a ton of disruption’ , but it will also reshape the nature of work and will create more opportunities. In an interview with Bloomberg, Roslansky linked the present technological shift to Industrial Revolution. He stressed on the fact that despite initial problems, AI will ultimately create more industries and multiple new job opportunities .Ryan Roslansky emphasised that the rise of AI doesn’t mean the end of work—it means the evolution of work. “We’re seeing a shift in the skills employers are looking for,” he noted, pointing to LinkedIn data highlighting increase in demand for AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills and prompt engineering.""There's going to be, over time, more and more options to build careers without having to go work for a big company,"" Ryan Roslansky suggested. He also said that the skills needed for the same jobs are also evolving. For instance in India, the job skills required for the same job have changed by 40% since 2015 and he expects this figure to rise to 70% by 2030.Roslansky's views align with those of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , who has also publicly stated that people are underestimating the impact of AI on jobs but rejects the notion of a ""bloodbath."" Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, has direct advice for those who claim artificial intelligence (AI) isn't useful and yet to find practical applications for the technology, suggesting that a lack of perceived utility stems from insufficient effort. He also shared examples of how he uses the tool effectively in his daily life.“Frankly, if you haven’t found something where it's useful to you, about something you care about, then you're not trying hard enough, you're not being original enough,” Hoffman stated during an interview on The Economist podcast, broadcast this week (via Business Insider).Both LinkedIn executives emphasise on the fact that it is important for workers to shift their focus from static jobs and master their tasks by learning new skills.","Linkedin ceo ryan roslansky says ai will reshape the nature of work.

The Kick deal that changed everything

Why she is returning to Twitch now



No YouTube comeback expected

A top name in online entertainment



Kaitlyn Siragusa , better known as Amouranth, a viral internet personality and streamer who has made her highly anticipated return to Twitch on June 20, 2025. Over the past two years, she earned a staggering $38 million on rival streaming platform Kick , becoming one of the most financially successful figures in online entertainment. Known for her bold mix of gaming, cosplay , ASMR, and real-life streams, Amouranth originally built her empire on Twitch before facing multiple bans and moving to other platforms. Her return signals both a personal comeback and a potential shift in the ongoing competition between streaming giants.Her return to Twitch not only marks a personal comeback but also highlights the evolving dynamics of the streaming industry. With platforms like Kick scaling back exclusivity deals and encouraging multistreaming, Amouranth’s move could signal a new era where top creators leverage multiple platforms on their own terms. While her relationship with YouTube remains strained, Twitch’s massive audience and cultural influence make it the ideal stage for her to continue growing her brand.Amouranth began her career as a cosplayer and model before joining Twitch in 2016, where she quickly gained massive popularity. Her streams combined gaming, audience interaction, and ASMR, attracting millions of viewers. She became especially known for her “hot tub” streams, a controversial Twitch subgenre that sparked widespread discussion. Despite facing repeated bans for pushing Twitch’s content boundaries, Amouranth remained a fan favorite and expanded her influence through various business ventures, including OnlyFans and merchandise. Her ability to adapt and innovate helped her become one of Twitch’s most successful and recognizable creators.In 2023, following xQc’s headline-making $100 million deal with Kick, Amouranth joined the platform backed by crypto gambling site Stake. Though the details of her contract were not publicly disclosed, she confirmed that her income more than doubled compared to Twitch. Over two years, she reportedly made $38 million through Kick deals, merchandise sales, and content subscriptions.On June 19, 2025, Amouranth shared a playful teaser video on X (formerly Twitter) hinting at her comeback. In the video, she is seen refueling a green car with a Kick license plate before driving off in a purple vehicle — Twitch’s signature color. A cartoon screen flashes “$38 million later.” While it is not yet confirmed if she will stream exclusively on Twitch, her return has already stirred excitement among fans.Amouranth’s YouTube presence has declined sharply. Her main channel was banned for ban evasion, and her ASMR channel was removed for guideline violations. Given this history, she is not expected to include YouTube in her future content plans.Even during her Kick run, Amouranth remained a widely recognized figure. She launched products, signed brand deals, and continued to grow her online presence. Her return to Twitch highlights her ongoing relevance and reflects the increasing competition among platforms to attract big names. As one of the most followed streamers in the world, Amouranth is poised to remain a dominant force in digital entertainment.","Kaitlyn siragusa, better known as amouranth, will return to twitch on june 20, 2025.

Trevor Zegras' trade to the Philadelphia Flyers speaks of a new chapter in the Anaheim Ducks' rebuilding journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/trevor-zegras-trade-to-the-philadelphia-flyers-speaks-of-a-new-chapter-in-the-anaheim-ducks-rebuilding-journey/articleshow/122031239.cms,"Image Via Twitter (Trevor Zegras' trade to the Philadelphia Flyers speaks of a new chapter in Anaheim Ducks' rebuilding journey)

Trevor Zegras becomes another Philadelphia as Pat Verbeek pounds the puck over the Anaheim Ducks

In a somewhat shocking yet largely confirmed rumour, the Anaheim Ducks have traded forward Trevor Zegras to the Philadelphia Flyers. The blockbuster trade corresponds with the aggressive off-season approach the Ducks are taking in order to reconstruct a roster that simply has been a failure in recent years. Zegras will now restart his life as the next great cornerstone in Philadelphia, while Anaheim intends to reshape its core around younger, more flexible assets and future NHL Draft picks.Twenty-four years young and one of the most marketed faces of the NHL, Trevor Zegras here holds fort in a major roster overhaul involving his name. In respect to his trade, the Ducks acquired forward Ryan Poehling, the 45th pick in the upcoming draft, and a 2026 fourth-round pick. The deal is indicative of Ducks' GM Pat Verbeek's strategy to capitalize on draft capital and handle their cap space in advance, keeping the agenda to freshen the team's identity in his mind.Zegras had 12 goals and 32 points in a 2024–25 injury-affected season after injuring his meniscus and missing the last 22 games. But still, considering how spectacular he has profiled and with prior spells of 65 points in 2022–23 and being named the EA Sports NHL cover athlete, this only underlines his offensive versatility.In Philadelphia, Zegras is expected to serve as a top-six forward and act as a cornerstone in the reshaping of the franchise's offense.The Ducks, meanwhile, continue to be highly aggressive this summer. With Kreider and the future being anointed with Joel Quenneville, Anaheim wants to step in the direction of long-term competitiveness under whom Verbeek has been given carte blanche. They operate with more than $36 million in cap space, with some very important RFAs to secure, including Mason McTavish and Lukas Dostal.A former 25th overall pick, Ryan Poehling adds a level of depth and versatility to Anaheim's forward group. Though not a star, his 31-point campaign in Philadelphia has yielded steady improvement and dependability. He has one year left on an inexpensive $1.5 million deal, offering the Ducks extra leverage heading into 2025-26.Also Read: Team USA’s Trevor Zegras eyes redemption at the 2025 IIHF World Championship The trade for Trevor Zegras is more than just a typical trade done at the 11th hour; it becomes a historic moment to define Anaheim's long-term view.

GitHub CEO to software engineers: ‘Key for winning’ AI coding tools is in ….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/github-ceo-to-software-developers-key-for-winning-ai-coding-tools-is-in-/articleshow/121991206.cms,"Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub

Poll Do you believe that manual coding skills are essential even with the rise of AI coding tools? No, AI can do it all Yes, absolutely

Startups can't rely on ""vibe coding"" alone

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the ""key for winning"" with AI coding tools is maintaining the ability to quickly modify AI-generated code manually, rather than relying entirely on automated agents. Speaking on ""The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,"" Thomas Dohmke emphasized that developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.The CEO outlined an ideal workflow where AI agents can write code and submit pull requests, but developers retain the ability to make rapid changes using their existing programming skills . This approach prevents the productivity trap of spending minutes describing simple changes in natural language when the same task could be completed in seconds through direct coding.""The worst alternative is trying to figure out how to provide feedback or prompt to describe in natural language what I already know how to do in programming language,"" Thomas Dohmke explained. Such scenarios could transform three-second tasks into three-minute ordeals, ultimately reducing rather than enhancing productivity.Thomas Dohmke also addressed the trending "" vibe coding "" phenomenon, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe heavy reliance on AI for code generation. During a recent Q&A at Station F in Paris, the GitHub CEO cautioned that startups cannot scale on vibe coding alone.Non-technical founders will struggle to build sustainable companies without skilled developers, he argued, noting they ""can't build a complex system to justify the next round."" The key is enabling developers to choose the best approach for each situation, whether that's leveraging AI agents for maximum ROI or handling tasks directly themselves.","Github ceo thomas dohmke says developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between ai assistance and hands-on coding.

The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google , and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs that has already eliminated more than 62,000 jobs in the first half of the year. From semiconductor manufacturers to social media platforms, major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities, leaving tens of thousands of workers searching for new opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.The layoffs span across all sectors of technology, affecting everyone from established hardware manufacturers like Intel planning to cut up to 21,700 positions to fintech companies like Block eliminating nearly 1,000 workers, streaming platforms downsizing staff, and even space companies like Blue Origin cutting over 1,000 employees. With artificial intelligence reshaping business models and companies focusing on operational efficiency, the human cost of technological transformation has become starkly apparent as some of the world's most valuable companies simultaneously invest billions in AI while eliminating traditional roles.Intel announced the most devastating single layoff in the tech industry for 2025, planning to eliminate more than 21,000 employees, representing roughly 20% of its total workforce. The semiconductor giant's cuts come ahead of its Q1 earnings call under newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, Intel plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July, affecting the unit that designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. With Intel's total workforce at 108,900 people as of December 2024, these combined reductions represent one of the largest single-company layoffs in tech history.Japanese electronics giant Panasonic announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, affecting approximately 4% of its total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan. CEO Yuki Kusumi said the cuts are designed to better prepare the century-old company for future decades, with 5,000 job losses expected in Japan and another 5,000 overseas. The company is trimming operations in non-growth areas such as televisions and industrial products to concentrate on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. Kusumi addressed the severity of the decision during an earnings call, stating he was ""truly sorry"" but emphasized that drastic cost structure cuts were necessary for the company to pursue growth.Microsoft implemented a multi-phase layoff strategy throughout 2025, first cutting over 6,500 jobs in May, affecting approximately 3% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. The Seattle-headquartered company followed this with additional layoffs affecting software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. The May cuts represent one of Microsoft's biggest layoffs since it eliminated 10,000 employees in 2023, and the company is reportedly contemplating further reductions that could happen through additional phases, with discussions about reducing middle managers and non-coding staff to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers.Meta announced it would cut 5% of its staff, targeting what CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as ""low performers"" as the company prepares for ""an intense year."" With more than 72,000 employees as of its latest quarterly report, the social media giant's cuts affect approximately 3,600 workers. The layoffs began in February and hit teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics operations hardest. Meta also conducted additional layoffs in April, eliminating over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology development for Meta's Quest headsets.HP announced it would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ""Future Now"" restructuring plan designed to save the company $300 million before the end of its fiscal year. The cuts represent a significant portion of the computer and printer manufacturer's workforce as the company seeks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The restructuring comes as HP faces ongoing challenges in the traditional PC and printing markets, with the company pivoting toward more profitable business segments and operational efficiency improvements.Google implemented several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of employees across multiple divisions. The search giant eliminated 200 workers in its global business unit, which handles partnerships and sales, while also laying off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division covering Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser. Additional cuts affected the People Operations and cloud organizations teams as part of a broader reorganization effort. Google offered a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees while restructuring to ""drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve customers.""Amazon conducted layoffs across multiple divisions, including approximately 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis businesses. The e-commerce giant also laid off dozens of workers in its communications department to help the company ""move faster, increase ownership, strengthen culture, and bring teams closer to customers."" These cuts are part of Amazon's broader cost-reduction strategy, having reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022.Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin laid off about 10% of its workforce, affecting more than 1,000 employees in what represents a significant reduction in the commercial space industry. CEO David Limp said the company's priority was ""to scale manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for customers."" The layoffs particularly targeted roles in engineering, research and development, and management positions. Limp acknowledged that rapid growth in recent years had created ""more bureaucracy and less focus than needed,"" necessitating organizational changes to align with execution priorities.Cloud-based customer management software company Salesforce cut more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce, despite reporting strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings. The cuts come as the company actively recruits and hires workers to sell new AI products, indicating a strategic shift rather than financial distress. Affected employees are eligible to apply for open internal roles, particularly in sales positions focused on Salesforce's artificial intelligence-powered products.Human resources software company Workday cut 8.5% of its workforce, eliminating around 1,750 employees as part of a strategic focus on artificial intelligence development. CEO Carl Eschenbach said the company would concentrate hiring in AI-related areas while expanding its global presence. The layoffs came with severance packages of at least 12 weeks of pay for affected employees. Eschenbach emphasized that ""the environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale.""Japanese automaker Nissan announced the most severe cuts in the automotive sector, planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2027 while reducing its factory operations from 17 to 10 facilities. The job losses include 9,000 layoffs announced late last year and come as the automaker faces challenges from US tariffs on imported vehicles and collapsing sales in China. Nissan reported a net loss of 671 billion yen ($4.5 billion) for the 2024 financial year and declined to issue an operating profit forecast for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its second major workforce reduction in just over a year. The company, which operates Square, Afterpay, CashApp, and Tidal, eliminated 931 positions representing around 8% of its workforce. The restructuring involved transitioning nearly 200 managers into non-management roles and closing almost 800 open positions. Dorsey announced the layoffs in an internal email titled ""smaller block,"" emphasizing that the changes were not driven by financial targets or AI replacements but were part of streamlining operations.General Motors' autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise laid off 50% of its workforce as it prepared to shut down operations entirely. The cuts included CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, with the remaining portions of the company moving under General Motors' direct control. The dramatic reduction represents one of the most significant failures in the autonomous vehicle sector, eliminating hundreds of jobs as the company ceased its independent operations.Coffee giant Starbucks eliminated 1,100 corporate employees as part of a comprehensive restructuring effort led by CEO Brian Niccol. The layoffs specifically targeted corporate staff and did not affect employees working in Starbucks stores. Niccol stated in a memo that the cuts would help Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The company implemented the layoffs to improve results after sales declined in the previous year.Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike cut approximately 500 jobs, representing 5% of its global workforce of just over 10,000 employees. CEO George Kurtz said the Austin, Texas-based company's job cuts would position it ""to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue cybersecurity leadership."" The layoffs came as CrowdStrike works to recover from a major software bug that temporarily disabled millions of Windows PCs worldwide, costing the company between $36 million and $53 million in restructuring expenses.Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, announced it would cut 13% of its approximately 2,500 full-time workers, eliminating around 325 positions. New CEO Spencer Rascoff implemented the cuts while addressing challenges in the dating app market, particularly with younger generations souring on dating platforms. The restructuring aims to remove one out of every five managers and focus on ""product velocity"" to drive growth, with Rascoff acknowledging that apps ""have felt like a numbers game rather than a place to build real connections.""Automattic, the parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, eliminated 16% of its nearly 1,500-person global workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg said the company had reached an ""important crossroads"" with revenue growth occurring in a highly competitive market where ""technology is evolving at unprecedented levels."" The restructuring aimed to improve ""productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest"" while the company offered severance and job placement resources to affected employees.German luxury automaker Porsche announced plans to cut 3,900 jobs over the coming years as part of efficiency improvements. About 2,000 of the reductions will come from the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, while the company will make the remaining 1,900 cuts by 2029 through natural attrition and limited hiring.

How Bill Gates and Melinda Gates reacted 'very differently' when their daughter announced her startup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-bill-gates-and-melinda-gates-reacted-very-differently-when-their-daughter-announced-her-startup/articleshow/121989368.cms,"Bill Gates: Phoebe Gates is the most different than I am

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates ' daughter Phoebe Gates launched an ecommerce app earlier this year. Phoebe co-founded the e-commerce app Phia with her former Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used.Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.When she told her father that she and Ms. Kianni wanted to get into the e-commerce space, his reaction, he said, was “Wow, a lot of people have tried, and there’s some big guys in there.” However, he was reportedly worried she might ask for money. In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Her mother Melinda Gates , who Phoebe calls her “rock,” told her she had to raise the capital on her own. “She saw it as a real opportunity for me to, like, learn and fail,” she said.Talking further about Phoebe Gates said that among all her children, she is “the most different than I am"". ""Because she’s so good with people. When we would go on family vacations, we would find some part of the beach to just be off on our own, and Phoebe would go down the beach and meet people and bring them back to introduce them to us,” Gates explained.","Bill gates: phoebe gates is the most different than i am.

Tech giants offer reassurances but damage spreads



European governments pivot toward digital independence



European governments and institutions are accelerating efforts to reduce their dependence on American tech giants after President Trump used executive powers to force Microsoft to suspend the email account of an International Criminal Court prosecutor investigating Israel for war crimes, according to a New York Times report.The February incident involving ICC prosecutor Karim Khan has become a watershed moment for European policymakers, who now view America's tech dominance as a potential weapon that could be wielded against them even in allied nations like the Netherlands. Microsoft's swift compliance with Trump's sanctions order shocked European officials and crystallized long-standing concerns about digital sovereignty .""The I.C.C. showed this can happen,"" Dutch cybersecurity expert and European Parliament member Bart Groothuis told the Times. ""It's not just fantasy."" Groothuis, who previously supported U.S. tech firms, said he has done a ""180-degree flip-flop"" and now believes Europe must take steps toward greater technological independence.The ICC incident has prompted immediate changes across European institutions. Some ICC officials have switched to Proton, a Swiss encrypted email provider, while the court has implemented extensive measures to ensure operational continuity despite ongoing U.S. sanctions, three sources familiar with the communications revealed to the Times.American tech companies control over 70 percent of Europe's cloud computing market, making the region heavily dependent on services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for essential digital infrastructure including file storage, data retrieval, and software operations.Microsoft President Brad Smith acknowledged that the ICC episode was a ""symptom"" of eroding U.S.-Europe trust, telling the Times that ""the I.C.C. issue added fuel to a fire that was already burning."" The company has since enacted policy changes to protect customers in similar geopolitical situations, and when Trump sanctioned four additional ICC judges this month, their email accounts remained active.CEO Satya Nadella recently visited the Netherlands to announce new ""sovereign solutions"" for European institutions, including enhanced legal and data security protections. Amazon and Google have launched similar initiatives targeting European customers concerned about geopolitical volatility.Despite corporate reassurances, European nations are pursuing concrete alternatives. Denmark's digital ministry is testing Microsoft Office replacements, while Germany's Schleswig-Holstein state is reducing Microsoft usage. The Netherlands government has made digital autonomy a central priority, exploring partnerships with European providers.The European Union has announced billion-euro investments in AI data centers and cloud infrastructure designed to reduce American tech dependence. European Parliament lawmakers are discussing policies favoring EU-based tech services for government procurement.European cloud providers like Netherlands-based Intermax Group and Switzerland's Exoscale report significant increases in new business. ""A few years ago, everyone was saying, 'They're our trusted partners,'"" Intermax CEO Ludo Baauw told the Times, referring to U.S. tech companies.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

Read: Amazon CEO's full address to employees

Today, in virtually every corner of the company, we're using Generative AI to make customers lives better and easier. What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we've only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality. Technologies like Generative AI are rare; they come about once-in-a-lifetime, and completely change what's possible for customers and businesses. So, we are investing quite expansively, and, the progress we are making is evident.

You can see it in what we're rolling out in Alexa+, our next generation

Alexa

personal assistant that's meaningfully smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant that can take significant actions for customers on top of providing intelligent answers to virtually any question.

You can see it with our AI shopping assistant that's being used by tens of millions of customers around the world to discover new products and make more informed purchase decisions.

You can see it in an increasing array of shopping features like ""Lens"" (very cool to be able to take a picture of an item and have it pull up the shopping result), ""Buy for Me"" (where I can ask our shopping agent to buy an item on another merchant's website for me), or Recommended Size (where we can predict the right size for you based on prior purchases and how different apparel brands run fit-wise relative to each other).

You can see it in how we're helping our independent sellers more easily create new product detail pages or get advice on how to be even more effective as a seller in our marketplace. Nearly half a million selling partners are using these services, and the listings they're creating are measurably better.

You can see it in Advertising where we've built a suite of AI tools that make it easier for brands to plan, onboard, create and optimize campaigns. In Q1 alone, over 50K advertisers used these capabilities.

And, you can see it in what we're delivering in AWS for builders, whether it's custom silicon (Trainium2) to provide better price-performance on model-training and inference, services that make it much easier to build Foundation Models (SageMaker), or leverage leading frontier models and do GenAI inference at scale (Bedrock), our own frontier model (Nova) to give customers leading intelligence at lower latency and cost, or services to make it much easier for developers to write code (Q and QCLI).

We're also using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations. In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots—all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed. We've rebuilt our Customer Service Chatbot with GenAI, providing an even better experience than we'd had before. And, we're assembling more intelligent and compelling product detail pages from leveraging GenAI.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

While we've made a lot of progress, we're still at the relative beginning. There are a few reasons we believe this and want to go even faster.

First, we have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live. Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast.

Second, and what makes this agentic future so compelling for Amazon, is that these agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers. Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point. We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones. Agents will be teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work, and that will get wiser and more helpful with more experience. If we build and leverage the right agents, it's going to rapidly accelerate our ability to make customers lives easier and better every day, and it's going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.

And third, we're going to keep pushing to operate like the world's largest start-up-- customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all. You will continue to see steam and I take actions to help us move faster, have more ownership, and invent more easily. AI will be a substantial catalyst here.

Today, we have over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but at our scale, that's a small fraction of what we will ultimately build. We're going to lean in further in the coming months. We're going to make it much easier to build agents, and then build (or partner) on several new agents across all of our business units and G&A areas.

As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team's brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams. When I first started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, I worked on leaner teams that got a lot done quickly and where I could have substantial impact. We didn't have tools resembling anything like Generative AI, but we had broad remits, high ambition, and saw the opportunity to improve (and invent) so many customer experiences. Fast forward 28 years and the most transformative technology since the Internet is here. Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.

There's so much more to come with Generative AI. I'm energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what's possible for our customers, partners, and how we work.

H-1B is the program that allows American companies to hire from foreign countries. The H-1B issue has emerged as a contentious issue after the USCIS recently revealed that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026. US tech workers started demanding the end of the H-1B programs so that Americans do not lose their jobs to their foreign counterparts.In December 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy championed a reform of H-1B programs and argued that US companies need to hire from foreign countries as US culture encourages mediocracy and therefore is not producing top talent.Now, with his argument that Americans are losing white collar jobs to ChatGPT, social media users pointed out that another option to save jobs for Americans is to end the H-1B program. ""Sounds like you're familiar with my consistent view that it's a deeply flawed program that needs to be fixed or gutted,"" Ramaswamy replied to one user.Social media users asked whether by 'fixed' he meant more Indians in the system.When Ramaswamy ran for president, he said he would ""gut"" the system for H-1B worker visas if he won the White House.

(Image created using AI for creative & illustrative purposes)

Care Leave for Mothers: Earlier this year, Sharjah approved a ""care leave"" provision for female government employees who give birth to a sick or disabled child requiring continuous care. This leave begins after the completion of regular maternity leave and can be extended annually for up to three years.





Part-Time Work System: A new system is being implemented to support part-time employment, allowing greater flexibility for government workers.





Appointment Priority: The law emphasizes priority in government job appointments for citizens and children of female citizens. Non-citizens may still be appointed, but only on contractual terms in accordance with executive regulations.





Grade System (A–B): A classification system has been introduced to structure government job appointments and define roles more clearly across departments.





Veterinary System: In a less-publicized but equally significant move, the decree-law includes the introduction of a new veterinary system in Sharjah, aimed at modernizing veterinary services and public health management in the emirate.





In a landmark move to modernize workplace policies and enhance employee welfare, the Government of Sharjah has introduced marriage leave for employees in government agencies, granting eight days of paid leave for those entering matrimony.This policy is part of a broader reform initiative under a new decree-law on human resources in the emirate. The decree was issued by His Highness Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, and represents a significant step in expanding government employee benefits.According to Abdullah Ibrahim Al Zaabi, Chairman of the Sharjah Human Resources Department, who spoke on the popular radio program ""Direct Line"", the decree-law includes a wide range of updates aimed at improving flexibility, inclusivity, and efficiency in the public sector. Key elements include:Marriage Leave: Government employees are now entitled to eight days of paid marriage leave, a benefit introduced for the first time in the emirate.The human resources reforms are part of a broader strategic vision championed by the Sharjah leadership to ensure that employee wellbeing, family support, and citizen empowerment remain at the center of public policy. The new benefits, particularly the introduction of marriage leave and extended care leave, reflect the emirate’s family-first ethos and commitment to inclusive employment practices.These reforms align with similar initiatives seen in the UAE in recent years, where public sector employee welfare is increasingly recognized as a key factor in institutional efficiency and social stability.","Government employees in sharjah are now entitled to eight days of paid marriage leave, a benefit introduced for the first time in the emirate.

Aditya Birla Group eyes billion-dollar club for clothing brands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/aditya-birla-group-eyes-billion-dollar-club-for-clothing-brands/articleshow/122033525.cms,"MUMBAI: Aditya Birla Group expects four of its lifestyle brands - Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly, and Peter England - to achieve billion-dollar status within a decade, benefiting from rising consumer interest in fashion, and higher discretionary spending, among other factors.While international lifestyle brands such as Louis Vuitton, Nike, Chanel, and Adidas have achieved multi-billion-dollar status, Indian fashion brands are yet to reach the billion-dollar milestone. Currently, Louis Philippe and Van Heusen each generate sales over Rs 2,000 crore, with Allen Solly and Peter England exceeding Rs 1,000 crore each. For comparison, the Raymond brand, owned by Gautam Singhania, generates sales exceeding Rs 3,000 crore.Aditya Birla Group ventured into fashion and lifestyle in 1999 by purchasing the four brands from European company Coats. Since then, the apparel business has seen several structural reorganisations. Initially operating as a division of Indian Rayon and Industries, the four brands were subsequently transferred to Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail. Currently, they operate under Aditya Birla Lifestyle Brands, which commenced trading on the stock exchanges on Monday.Its shares closed at Rs 159 on the BSE, showing a decline of nearly 5%.Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said, ""Our ambition is clear: to build India's first portfolio of billion-dollar brands in fashion and lifestyle."" The quartet of brands, which began their journey in menswear, have since diversified their product range to include womenswear, footwear, bags and fashion accessories. The Indian fashion industry is projected to expand to $170 billion by 2030, representing a 1.5-fold increase from current figures.According to the group, this expansion, driven by consumers shifting from unbranded to branded products, presents an ""incredible opportunity"" for the brands to grow substantially.","Aditya birla group expects four of its lifestyle brands to achieve billion-dollar status within a decade.

"PayU India breaks even in H2 FY25, revenues rise 12%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/payu-india-breaks-even-in-h2-fy25-revenues-rise-12/articleshow/122031824.cms,"BENGALURU: PayU India, the digital payments and credit platform owned by global internet investor Prosus, reported a strong recovery in FY25, achieving breakeven in its payments segment in the second half of the year. The turnaround was driven by deeper penetration with existing merchants and an expanding range of value‑added services across its payments and lending offerings.For the year ended March 31, 2025, PayU India’s payments business delivered revenues of $498 million, a 12% year‑on‑year rise. Total payments volume (TPV) increased 14%, bolstered by strong momentum across financial services, government payments, airlines, and food delivery sectors.The payments segment achieved breakeven in the second half despite rising competitive pressure and lower take‑rates across digital payments in the country. Meanwhile, PayU’s credit business also gained traction, with its loan book expanding by 19% and revenues surging 63% over the prior year. The adjusted EBIT loss for the credit segment narrowed to $32 million, impacted by higher consumer loan provisions and credit costs.Prosus, which has invested roughly $8.6 billion across more than 30 ventures in India, reaffirmed the country’s role as a cornerstone in its global digital commerce and fintech ecosystems. In its annual review, the company said PayU India’s performance was central to its long‑term approach for building AI‑enabled payments and lending platforms across high‑growth markets.“Achieving breakeven in payments and recording robust loan book growth reflects the strength of PayU India’s merchant relationships and its role in capturing the shift toward digital payments and credit in one of the world’s fastest‑growing markets,” Prosus stated.Looking ahead, the company said it aims to deepen its merchant ecosystem by introducing more value‑added services across payments, lending, and digital financial services. It also emphasised its focus on AI‑led fraud detection, risk modeling, and customer experience as core differentiators for PayU India.","Payu india, the digital payments and credit platform owned by global internet investor prosus, reported a strong recovery in fy25.
