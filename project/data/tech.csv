E-notices will be issued for non-compliance, and continued failure to pay may lead to FASTag suspension along with other VAHAN-related penalties, the statement warned.The ministry reiterated that this tech-driven upgrade is being piloted only at select toll plazas for now and is not a blanket nationwide rollout.","The ministry of road transport and highways (morth) dismissed reports suggesting a satellite-based tolling system would be rolled out nationwide from 1 may 2025.

Maitri

. Remember these two names. We’ll orbit back to them soon. For now, let’s travel back to half a century ago:

A chill breeze rustled through the vast Russian steppe as countdown “10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0” began post noon at Kapustin Yar Cosmodrome, some 3,200km from New Delhi, where a young team of Indian scientists waited anxiously.

They heard ‘Payyakali’ — a Russian expression first uttered by

Yuri Gagarin

at the time of his historic manned flight, meaning ‘let us go’ — and saw their 358kg dream soaring aboard Kosmos-3M rocket, at 1:28:55pm, Indian time.

It was Saturday, April 19, 1975. Everything had been meticulously prepared for this moment, with Indian scientists working tirelessly over the course of 40 days in Russia. Every detail had been scrutinised.

Despite the distant location and the challenges of the task, the young Indian team, fresh from academic pursuits and filled with an unshakeable resolve, had brought

Aryabhata

, India’s first satellite, to life.

“The weather suddenly changed with the dawn of the new day. The Sun started shining brightly through a cloud-free sky despite the thermometer hovering around 10°C, ready to herald the significant event of the birth of a new space power in the world,” Aryabhata’s project director Prof UR Rao described the day many years later.





Fifty years to this day, it’s worth knowing that not everything in the run-up was as friendly as the Soviets, their weather, or as smooth as the Kosmos-3M’s launch on that day. As the cliche goes, let’s start from the beginning.

Heavier than China

In 1971, as India toyed with the idea of building a 100kg scientific satellite compatible with a Scout rocket, PM Indira Gandhi forwarded

Vikram Sarabhai

a letter from DP Dhar, the Indian ambassador in Moscow.

The Soviets were open to assisting India in space. Sarabhai swiftly arranged a meeting with Soviet ambassador Nikolai Pegov. Udupi Ramachandra Rao was summoned to present India’s case.

“After patiently hearing me for 30 minutes, the ambassador asked about the weight of China’s first satellite. When I said around 190kg, he insisted India’s must be heavier — and said the USSR would launch it, whatever the weight,” Rao later recounted.

Sarabhai’s sudden demise in Dec 1971 didn’t stall progress. Under Prof MGK Menon — a renowned cosmic-ray physicist holding interim charge of Isro — a joint meeting with Soviet experts to finalise Indo-Soviet space cooperation was held in Thiruvananthapuram in Feb 1972. Before this, Menon voiced his reservations to Rao.

“If we want to enter space and use it for national development, this is our best chance. With a free launch and minimum expenditure, we can build satellite technology and grow from there,” Rao said.

Menon briefed PM Gandhi in Delhi, then joined the Thiruvananthapuram talks. Her response was positive — but she wanted to know the cost. Menon connected Rao to her. “Madam, give me three hours…”

Rao assembled a core team — SP Kosta, K Kasturirangan, R Ashiya, and Tarsem Singh — and asked for a cost estimate. They returned with Rs 60 lakh.

“You can’t get half the space-qualified components for that! Do you even know how much they cost?” Rao exclaimed.

He reworked the numbers with them, arriving at Rs 3 crore, with Rs 1 crore in foreign exchange. He relayed the figure to Gandhi.

“Go ahead and sign the agreement,” she said. On May 10, 1972, a historic Indo-Soviet agreement was signed between M Keldysh, president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and Menon. It outlined the launch of India’s first satellite — yet unnamed — from a Soviet cosmodrome. VM Kovtunenko was appointed Soviet project director; Rao led the Indian side.

Tin sheds in Peenya

Next: where to build it? Bangalore or Hyderabad? Bangalore won. With help from Karnataka’s industries secretary Satish Chandran, Rao secured four bare industrial sheds — 5,000 sqft each — in the then-nascent Peenya Industrial Estate.

These sheds were transformed at astonishing speed. Two became specialised control electronics labs, including a 1,500-sqft clean room for satellite integration.

On Ganesh Chaturthi, September 11, 1972, they were informally inaugurated.

A handful of scientists grew into a 150-strong team working round-the-clock. But procurement was a major hurdle. Undeterred, Isro formed a special procurement team led by Rao, with TN Seshan and

YS Rajan

. They travelled across Europe and the US, placing spot orders and bypassing red tape to secure equipment affordably — and fast.

On July 11, 1974, PM Gandhi visited Peenya.

As she looked into the clean room where Aryabhata’s flight model was being finalised, her face lit up with quiet pride. This wasn’t just a machine — it was India’s boldest declaration of scientific intent.

Jawahar? Maitri? No — Aryabhata!

At the final project board meeting in March 1975 — just a month before launch — the team discussed names. The options: Aryabhata (after the ancient Indian astronomer), Jawahar (for independence), and Maitri (for Indo-Soviet friendship).

Now, orbit back to where we started.

Aryabhata during its integration.

“As expected, Mrs Gandhi picked Aryabhata,” Rao recalled. A special stamp was planned to mark the launch. To account for a possible one-day delay, two sets were printed — for April 19 (the scheduled date) and April 20 (backup). The launch succeeded on April 19, and the second set was destroyed.

Goal, challenges & achievements

Aryabhata was designed and built in just 30 months by a young team of Indian scientists and engineers, working with scarce resources.

The quasi-spherical satellite, measuring 1.59m across and weighing 358kg, had primary objectives of: technological demonstration and scientific research in X-ray astronomy, aeronomy, and solar physics.

Its 26-faced polyhedron structure was covered with solar cells generating 46W, supported by a Ni-Cd battery. It employed passive thermal systems and cold gas jets for spin stabilisation, demonstrating sophisticated engineering.

A notable feature was its data handling capability—monitoring 91 parameters with time resolutions from 250 ms to 4 secs, transmitting at 256 bits/sec. In playback mode, this was 2,560 bits/sec, impressive for its time.

With its launch into a LEO orbit — 50.7° inclination, 619km apogee, 568km perigee — Aryabhata established a foundation for future satellites.

All on-board systems functioned perfectly until the satellite experienced tumbling at 0.3° per second instead of maintaining stable spin, and the aeronomy instrument's power supply failed.

However, engineers stabilised the satellite at 50 revolutions/minute by the 45th orbit. In five days, it went silent but its mainframe remained active until March 1981 and the satellite itself remained in orbit until its atmospheric re-entry on Feb 10, 1992.

Despite power issues affecting scientific experiments, initial data yielded significant discoveries. The X-ray instrument measured intensity from the complex “Cyg-X1” source during an upward emission transition and characterised X-ray emission from numerous sources.

The payload measured neutron and gamma ray fluxes from the quiet sun and latitudinal distribution of high-energy neutrons.

Several technological experiments relevant to future programmes were successfully conducted, including satellite tracking using tone ranging, voice and data communication between USSR and Bangalore, tele-medicine experiments connecting remote rural areas with city hospitals, and meteorological data transmission as a precursor to later data relay experiments on Insat.

Aryabhata’s most significant impact was establishing a firm foundation in satellite technology, creating a confident core team for building more complex operational satellites, and developing infrastructure for India's future satellite programme.

“No failure on Aryabhata was perceived as a failure. It might sound cliched, they were stepping stones for future success,” , Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium director, BR Guruprasad, who had spent 39 years at Isro before his current role, said.","The launch of aryabhata, india's first satellite, took place on april 19, 1975. It was the culmination of 40 days of work by a team of indian scientists in russia. But not everything in the run-up was as friendly as the soviets or their weather.

MUMBAI: The actions of two promoters of once high-flying Gensol Engineering is a case study in complete disregard for laid down corporate governance norms. Their deeds included illegal fund diversion for personal enrichment, stock price manipulation, forgery of 'no default' letters from lenders like IREDA and PFC to falsely project there was no default by the company, and misleading Sebi The two promoters of now disgraced company, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi , used hundreds of crores rupees of the entity as they wished, a Sebi investigation showed. The interim investigation revealed that the two had systematically used loans from several creditors, taken in the name of Gensol, to buy a luxury flat in The Camellias in Gurugram and to jack up Gensol's stock price. Not only this, the loans were used for personal benefit through their private ventures and for purposes other than for which they were taken.Sebi's investigation revealed that the two brothers, among other expenses for personal use from diverted funds, spent Rs 26 lakh to buy golf sets, spent nearly Rs 23 lakh to pay credit card dues, around Rs 8 lakh for interior decoration. In one of the several instances of fund diversions, Gensol transferred Rs 775 crore to Go-Auto , an auto dealership through which it bought electric vehicles for BluSmart, a ride hailing company.Of this, about Rs 570 crore was used to buy EVs for BluSmart. Of the balance Rs 205 crore, Rs 43 crore was diverted to buy the luxury flat in Gurugram, developed by real estate major DLF. Initially booked in the name of the mother of the two promoters, the transaction was later reversed in the name of Capbridge Ventures, a partnership of the two Jaggi brothers.Also read: Commuters in Bengaluru, NCR get the blues as e-cab firm BluSmart pulls plug On Tuesday, Sebi barred the two promoters from the securities markets until further notice. The regulator also ordered a forensic audit of Gensol's books. In the 29-page report by Ashwani Bhatia, whole time member, Sebi, it also detailed how company funds were diverted to jack up share prices of the company.It used a company named Wellray, an arm of Gensol, to trade in the shares of the company and create an artificial market to inflate the stock price. For more than two-and-a-half years till Dec 2024, about 99% of the stock's volume was created using funds from Wellray. ""What we are witnessing is not just financial mismanagement - it's a full-scale betrayal of public trust,"" Sebi in its order noted. ""Promoters were running the company like a personal piggy bank.

Cutting costs amid dull demand

BENGALURU: For over two decades, IT companies have been the biggest hirers of engineering and technology talent. However, amid uncertainty, IT companies are treading cautiously when it comes to workforce expansion. With increased adoption of AI and automation, there is greater focus on productivity.The top three Indian IT firms added 1,438 employees during the March quarter, reversing a decline of 936 in headcount in the Dec quarter. TCS added 625 people, while Infosys and Wipro added 199 and 614 employees, respectively, during Q4.However, the top five Indian IT firms saw a collective net headcount reduction of 2,587 in the Dec quarter, contrasting sharply with the Sept quarter's addition of 15,033 employees.IT firms are bracing for a bleak hiring forecast due to the overhang of macroeconomic headwinds reshaping demand environment, leading to a dent in the job market. Firms are proceeding with caution, stressing the current climate necessitates prudent workforce planning and cost-efficiency measures. For FY25, the combined net headcount addition of TCS, Infosys, and Wipro was 13,503 compared to a decline of 64,000 people in the previous year.TCS EVP & CHRO Milind Lakkad said that the business environment will influence the firm's decision on net additions. ""We'll continue to hire from campuses, and it will be similar to last year's numbers. With respect to net additions, it depends on the overall business environment and what we eventually hire in the market,"" he said.Wipro CHRO Saurabh Govil said his company has adopted a prudent campus hiring strategy. ""We burnt our fingers three years back. So, we are very conscious that we do it the right way,"" he said.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said, ""In the new era of growth driven by AI, platforms, and third-party software sales, hiring metrics are increasingly losing relevance.""Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, said there is considerable focus across major IT services firms to keep costs to a minimum and maximise current resources. ""This hiring metric is very relevant to the changing times. The services firms are looking to incorporate current staff plus AI as opposed to the traditional model of hiring freshers and new staff to bolster growth,"" he said.India's tech sector hired 1,26,000 people in FY25, taking the total talent base to 5.8 million. Nasscom restated that it hired 90,000 employees during the year-ago period, taking the tally to 5.6 million. This comes at a time when large IT firms are seeing a decline in headcount, and much of the net addition last year was on account of GCCs. ""This is perhaps the worst environment we have known for college graduates looking for jobs. With the current economic uncertainty, this slow hiring metric will continue to be flat, and I can see it staying this way throughout 2025,"" Fersht said.","It firms are bracing for a bleak hiring forecast due to the overhang of macroeconomic headwinds reshaping demand environment.

MUMBAI: Global coffee giants Starbucks and Tim Hortons have a new competitor in India - Asian rival Kopi Kenangan . The Indonesian brand, valued at over $1 billion, plans to capitalise on the growing cafe culture in the country with pricing lower than its competitors and a menu localised to cater to the Indian palate.""For any retail brand, it would be such a waste if you miss the train in India,"" Edward Tirtanata, co-founder and group CEO at Kenangan Brands, told TOI. The company is backed by Peak XV Partners and Meta co-founder Eduardo Saverin's B Capital.A huge population, expanding economy, and significant purchasing power in metros like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru provide enough room for new entrants to have a play in the market despite a growing mix of global and local coffee chains in the country, said Tirtanata. For India, where the cafe market is still nascent compared to other Asian countries, the brand has priced its menu cheaper than the rate at which it sells in other markets like Singapore and Australia, Tirtanata said.Besides global brands like Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Pret A Manger, a new crop of home-grown brands like Third Wave Coffee and Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters are expanding in the local market alongside traditional chains Barista and Cafe Coffee Day.C CD, which ushered in the cafe culture in the country in the 90s, lost ground to rivals weighed down by huge debt and financial troubles. The company has been reducing its store count.In India, where socialising over a cup of coffee or tea is a popular culture, QSR brands McDonald's and KFC are also competing for a share of the coffee space through their offerings.Kopi Kenangan's pricing in the market, which is largely led by students, young Gen Z, and millennials, many of whom are also in their first jobs and may look for cheaper options, starts at Rs 99 for an Espresso shot and under Rs 150 for bigger servings, lower by about Rs 80-100 than what Starbucks and local chains like Blue Tokai offer. ""Our price points are far more accessible than other international chains. We are positioned well within a gap that exists in the Indian market,"" said Tirtanata.Its strategy to source most ingredients locally has partly helped the company to keep its pricing low. Sluggish consumer demand amid high inflation over the past few quarters weighed on brands like Starbucks, which slowed store expansion. Kopi Kenangan, which launched in Delhi earlier this month, plans to enter Mumbai and Bengaluru in the next couple of years.","Kopi kenangan plans to capitalise on the growing cafe culture in the country.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.

The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021.

The Series A funding round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners , and participants included Silicon Valley billionaire Vinod Khosla’s Khosla Ventures and Peak XV Partners , formerly Sequoia Capital India & Southeast Asia, Sarvam said Thursday.The Bangalore-based startup, until recently in stealth mode, was co-founded by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar. It has ambitious plans to build open source foundational AI systems as well as tools for creating apps for the meager compute infrastructure available to developers in India. The startup has a total of 18 employees and is just opening an office in the city.""What we are showing is that you can build large language models with limited resources,” Raghavan said in a phone interview. ""We are building at a smaller scale and demonstrating that these can be extremely cost and energy efficient so they can be accessed by everyone.""Large language models, like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama, are powerful AI systems that understand by learning from vast amounts of diverse data from the internet and elsewhere to summarize, translate, and create text, audio and video for a wide range of applications. The rivalry to develop ever-more sophisticated models is heating up in Silicon Valley and such efforts have attracted billions of dollars in investments.","Sarvam ai is building large language models targeted at unique uses in indian languages.
