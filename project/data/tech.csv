"To drive sale of EVs, government to clarify they are exempt from 15-year 'end of life' norm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-drive-sale-of-evs-government-to-clarify-they-are-exempt-from-15-year-end-of-life-norm/articleshow/123082925.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs.The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far.Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales.Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place.Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks.Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates.At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.","The power ministry will also expedite extending the cafe norms to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses.

His fortune showcases how luxury goods and global branding can rival tech industry wealth.Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, transformed the company during his tenure (2000–2014), significantly expanding its software and enterprise services portfolio. After retiring, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion, diversifying his investments. Much of his wealth comes from Microsoft stock holdings, which continue to grow as the company remains a leader in cloud computing and software.Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, is known globally as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his unmatched value investing strategies. Berkshire Hathaway owns diverse businesses like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen, making it a financial powerhouse. Buffett is also a leading philanthropist, pledging most of his fortune to charitable causes through the Giving Pledge initiative. Despite his immense wealth, Buffett is known for his modest lifestyle and long-term focus on ethical, disciplined investing.Together, these billionaires not only reflect individual success but also underscore the sectors defining the 21st-century economy—tech, AI, luxury, and finance. Their influence spans across industries, policy, innovation, and philanthropy, shaping the world far beyond just their net worth.","Elon musk stands as the world’s richest individual, owing his fortune to groundbreaking ventures in electric vehicles, space exploration, and artificial intelligence.

Who is Matt Deitke? 24-year-old AI genius who rejected Meta’s $125 million offer and then Mark Zuckerberg personally met him with a doubled package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-matt-deitke-24-year-old-ai-genius-who-rejected-metas-125-million-offer-and-then-mark-zuckerberg-personally-met-him-with-a-doubled-package/articleshow/123071945.cms,"

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt deitke is considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

Who is Mira Murati? Former OpenAI CTO who rejected Mark Zuckerberg’s $1 billion offer to join Meta AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-mira-murati-former-openai-cto-who-rejected-mark-zuckerbergs-1-billion-offer-to-join-meta-ai/articleshow/122994020.cms,"Mira Murati: The mind behind ChatGPT and beyond

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. She also oversaw OpenAI's deployment of safety protocols that became foundational to industry-wide AI governance frameworks. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. She was instrumental in assembling the original alignment teams, ensuring ethical considerations were baked into product design from the earliest stages. Murati once remarked, “We don’t just code intelligence—we craft responsibility,” a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for ethical AI development. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. The company is pioneering customizable, interpretable AI systems designed to be tailored to local languages, cultures, and industries—advancing the democratization of advanced AI technology globally. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks. This wasn't just a rejection of Meta—it was a stand against the commodification of AI talent.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers, empowering diverse voices, ethical frameworks, open collaboration, and long-term human-centric progress.","Mira murati, founder of thinking machines lab, turned down $1 billion offer from meta ceo mark zuckerberg.

"Tim Cook breaks Steve Jobs’ this record at Apple, what it says about Apple’s evolution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tim-cook-breaks-steve-jobs-this-record-at-apple-what-it-says-about-apples-evolution/articleshow/123060520.cms,"Tim Cook surpasses Jobs’ CEO tenure: a historic leadership milestone

Apple's evolution under Tim Cook: Beyond the iPhone

Financial transformation: From billions to trillions

The legacy debate: innovation vs. sustainability

What lies ahead for Tim Cook and Apple?

Tim Cook has officially become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, surpassing the legendary Steve Jobs . As of August 1, 2025, Cook has led the tech giant for 5,091 days—one day longer than Jobs’ combined tenure as CEO. This milestone marks not just a shift in leadership duration but reflects Apple’s evolution from a design-centric innovator under Jobs to a global services and hardware powerhouse under Cook. The transition tells a larger story about how Apple has matured, diversified, and continued to thrive even in a post-Jobs era.Steve Jobs served as Apple’s CEO in two phases: first as interim CEO (1997–2000) and then officially until his resignation in 2011, totaling 5,090 days. Tim Cook, who took over immediately after Jobs stepped down, has now served for 5,091 days and counting. Though Jobs is credited with Apple’s dramatic resurgence and visionary product launches, Cook’s long-lasting leadership has brought financial stability, record-breaking market caps, and expansive global growth.Steve Jobs was known for his intense, hands-on, visionary leadership style. He spearheaded revolutionary products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Tim Cook, in contrast, is a calm and strategic operator who optimized Apple’s supply chains, expanded into services, and championed sustainability and accessibility. Cook’s approach relies more on empowering teams and long-term planning, reflecting a matured corporate culture.While Jobs reshaped consumer tech with breakthrough devices, Cook diversified Apple’s ecosystem. Under his leadership, the company launched the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, AirTag, Vision Pro, and its own Apple silicon chips. On the software and services front, he led the growth of Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, News+, and Fitness+, turning Apple into a recurring revenue machine beyond just hardware sales.In Jobs’ final year (2011), Apple earned around $108 billion in revenue. Under Cook, Apple crossed a staggering $394 billion in annual revenue by 2022. More impressively, Apple became the world’s first $3 trillion company in market capitalization, reinforcing Cook’s reputation as a financial powerhouse who brought unprecedented shareholder value and stability.While Jobs’ era is remembered for disruptive innovation and iconic product moments, Cook’s tenure is defined by sustainability, inclusivity, and long-term growth. Cook built on Jobs' foundation, but his success sparks debate: has Apple lost its spark of innovation, or has it simply evolved into a mature, diversified tech empire? Either way, Cook’s milestone highlights the company’s transformation from a volatile innovator into a global economic titan.As Apple continues to explore AI, spatial computing, and health tech, Cook remains at the helm with no official successor in sight. Speculation is growing that he may also assume the role of chairman, consolidating his leadership. Whether or not Cook eventually steps aside, his tenure has redefined what it means to lead Apple—and shaped the company’s trajectory for the next generation.","Tim cook has officially become the longest-serving ceo in apple’s history, surpassing the legendary steve jobs.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates.

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s unified payments interface (upi) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

Reddit’s financial earnings



Reddit is all set to make a bold pivot towards becoming a full-fledged search engine. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform. The announcement came as part of the company's Q2 2025 shareholder letter, which highlighted strong financial performance driven by advertising and a growing user base. “Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman. The move comes amid explosive growth in Reddit’s internal search usage, which now sees over 70 million weekly queries.During the earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman framed the initiative as a natural evolution for the platform, which has long been the de facto search engine for millions seeking genuine, opinion-based answers. ""For years, people have been adding 'reddit' to their search queries to find real experiences, recommendations, and discussions,"" Huffman stated. ""Our communities are the world's most valuable database of human experience. We're simply building the infrastructure to make that wisdom more accessible and searchable.""Reddit’s pitch is simple: real people, real answers. In a world increasingly dominated by algorithmic summaries, Reddit believes that nuanced, lived experiences are irreplaceable. A recent survey showed that 80% of users trust human responses over AI-generated ones for complex questions.“To focus on the areas that matter most, we are deprioritising a few initiatives, including our work on the user economy. It’s still an opportunity we believe in, but we’re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs: improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman.Reddit’s Q2 revenue hit $500 million, up 78% year-over-year, with a net income of $89 million and a gross margin of 90.8%. Advertising revenue alone soared to $465 million, driven by new AI-enhanced ad formats like Conversation Summary Add-ons, which boost clickthrough rates by 10%.With Q3 revenue projected between $535 million and $545 million, Reddit is doubling down on search, deprioritizing other initiatives like its user economy to focus on core product improvements and international growth.","Reddit ceo steve huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and ai-powered answers across the platform.

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI

As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation. Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","Openai ceo sam altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of gpt-5, the newest and most powerful version of chatgpt.

India is rapidly emerging as a major force in the global semiconductor landscape, with its domestic market aimed to grow from $38 billion in 2023 to between $100 and $110 billion by 2030. This projection comes as the global semiconductor industry is set to touch the $1 trillion mark by the end of the decade, according to a government statement cited by ANI on Sunday.The government noted that India is transitioning swiftly from policy formulation to tangible production in the semiconductor space, with fabrication, assembly, and design centres being set up across the country. ""The global semiconductor market is expected to reach USD 1 Trillion by 2030 with India's market occupying a substantial portion of it,"" it said, quoted by ANI.Several large-scale investments have been committed to semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, reinforcing India’s ambitions. In June 2023, Micron Technology announced a Rs 22,516 crore investment in an ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. In February 2024, Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, committed Rs 91,000 crore to a wafer fabrication plant in Dholera, Gujarat, with a planned capacity of 50,000 wafers per month.Also in February, CG Power & Industrial Solutions, along with Renesas and Stars, proposed a Rs 7,600 crore chip-making facility in Sanand, aiming to produce 15 million chips daily. Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Pvt Ltd (TSAT) is setting up a Rs 27,000 crore facility in Morigaon, Assam, with a production target of 48 million chips daily. In September 2024, Kaynes Semicon Pvt Ltd is set to launch operations in Sanand with a Rs 3,307 crore investment and a daily output of 6.33 million chips. By May 2025, a joint venture between HCL and Foxconn will begin operations in Jewar, Uttar Pradesh, with a Rs 3,700 crore facility producing 20,000 wafers monthly—equivalent to 36 million units annually.The government also outlined how India is poised to contribute to three critical pillars of the semiconductor supply chain. In equipment, India is leveraging its robust MSME ecosystem to scale up the production of essential semiconductor equipment components. In materials, India’s reserves of chemicals, minerals, and industrial gases position it well to support raw material needs for chip production. In services, the country boasts a large talent pool skilled in R&D, logistics, and next-generation technologies such as AI, big data, cloud computing, and IoT, strengthening its backend and design capabilities.To support this transformation, the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) was launched in December 2021, with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore. The initiative aims to incentivise investments in chip fabrication, display manufacturing, and design infrastructure. Guided by global experts, ISM serves as the central agency for implementing semiconductor-related schemes and policies. Alongside ISM, initiatives like the SEMICON India Programme and India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) are helping deepen India’s global integration in the electronics value chain.Semiconductors form the backbone of all modern electronics—from smartphones to satellites. India’s push into this domain is expected to fuel the digital economy, enhance national security, reduce dependency on imports, and increase technological self-reliance. A recent example of domestic capability was seen during the Chandrayaan-3 mission, where the Vikram lander used Indian-built chips and AI to autonomously identify a safe landing site—showcasing homegrown semiconductor applications in space and defence.As approved facilities begin operations and new projects gather momentum, India is steadily evolving from a chip consumer into a critical global contributor to semiconductor manufacturing.",India is rapidly emerging as a major force in the global semiconductor landscape.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.













On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals.During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements.Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.Charging speeds are categorized as:These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint.

Application pathway & official guidance

Applications must be submitted through official ICP platforms, including the smart services portal, GDRFA (for Dubai), or TAMM (for Abu Dhabi). No consultancy or third-party service is authorised to lodge applications.





While some agencies issued misleading claims, for example, selling services priced at Dh40,000, official application fees are typically around Dh3,000, excluding costs such as medical tests or Emirates ID.

The ICP has warned it will take legal action against entities spreading misinformation or soliciting money unofficially.









Why this clarification matters now

As misinformation spreads rapidly online, especially targeting applicants in India and Bangladesh, individuals risk falling prey to scams or paying undocumented fees.





Only merit-based, category‑specific applications are honoured, there is no buying of visas via payment alone.





ICP encourages everyone to verify details using official UAE government portals or authorised customer service centres.

The UAE’s Golden Visa programme has been a magnet for global investors, skilled professionals, and long-term residents seeking stability and opportunity in the Emirates. But as its popularity grows, so do the rumours surrounding it. Officials and government portals have moved to debunk several widespread misconceptions, urging residents and applicants to rely solely on verified sources when exploring eligibility and application procedures.The UAE Golden Visa is a long-term residency program introduced in 2019 to attract and retain exceptional talent, investors, entrepreneurs, researchers, and skilled professionals in fields such as science, engineering, health, education, and the arts. It allows eligible individuals to reside in the UAE for up to 10 years without the need for a local sponsor, with benefits including the ability to sponsor family members, own 100% of businesses, and enjoy greater visa security. The initiative aims to support national development by offering stability to those who significantly contribute to the country's economy and innovation sectors.Contrary to advertisements by overseas consultancies, the ICP has confirmed that the UAE does not offer lifetime Golden Visas for any nationality via a one-time fee.Such claims lack legal grounds, and the processing must be handled through official ICP systems only. A case involving Rayad Group, which claimed such offers, is under legal scrutiny.Authorities including the ICP, SCA, and VARA have jointly stated that investments in cryptocurrencies or tokens such as TON are not eligible grounds for a Golden Visa. Visa eligibility is based on defined categories, crypto does not feature among them.This is misleading. While skilled professionals must earn at least AED 30,000 per month including allowances, this refers to total salary, not just basic pay. Additionally, under executive-level eligibility, a basic salary of AED 50,000 is required. All salary conditions must align with UAE employment classification and documentation.The UAE Golden Visa is granted only to individuals who meet strict official categories and criteria, as outlined on the government portal (u.ae) and ICP platforms. Eligible groups include:There is no blanket or lifetime Golden Visa scheme based on payment. Golden Visa eligibility is strictly defined, application processes are only valid via government portals, and crypto-based or salary‑only schemes are not recognised. Prospective applicants should rely exclusively on official ICP and UAE government resources to ensure legitimacy and avoid fraudulent offers.No. The UAE does not grant lifetime Golden Visas through a one-time payment.

While income is considered, you must also meet other professional or academic criteria.Always check with the official UAE ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security) website or trusted government portals.",Icp has officially debunked major falsehoods circulating about the golden visa.

Stock market recommendations:Suzlon’s outlook remains robust with expected order inflows of ~4GW in FY26, including ~1.5GW from NTPC, taking the potential order book to ~6.5GW by FY26-end. The EPC share is set to rise from ~20% to ~50% over the medium term, improving execution visibility. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s local content mandate, effective July 31, 2025, requires domestic sourcing of key turbine components, enhancing Suzlon’s competitive position given its integrated manufacturing base.The gradual phase-out of Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) waivers should aid smoother project execution. Proactive land acquisition and EPC expansion strengthen readiness for upcoming opportunities. Further, a projected 30–35 day improvement in the cash conversion cycle will bolster balance sheet strength, free cash flow generation, and sustainable RoEs, positioning Suzlon well for medium-term growth.BEL posted a 25% YoY PAT growth to INR9.7b in Q1FY26, led by strong margin performance—gross margin at 53.2% and EBITDA margin expanding 580bps to 28.1%.This, coupled with a favourable mix & disciplined execution, drove a 16% PAT beat. With a record-high order book of INR749b and Q1 inflows of INR76b (+53% YoY), BEL is strategically positioned to benefit from high-value defense programs like QRSAM (INR250b), MF-STAR radar, LCA Mk1A, & electronic warfare systems.Execution of multiple large-scale projects in FY26 is expected to support BEL’s targeted >15% revenue growth. Export prospects and indigenisation-led orders further enhance its long-term revenue visibility.

IPO-bound Arcil eyes retail loans as corp NPAs dry up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ipo-bound-arcil-eyes-retail-loans-as-corp-npas-dry-up/articleshow/123083656.cms,".

Mumbai: The country's oldest bad loan company, IPO-bound Arcil (Asset Reconstruction Company of India) , gives an insight into the future of loan recovery for retail loans in its offer document filed with Sebi.The company has said it is setting up a digital platform that will allow defaulting retail borrowers to submit settlement offers and receive instant acceptance, eliminating the need for manual intervention. With a shrinking pool of corporate NPAs, Arcil is pivoting towards technology-driven retail loan recovery as its promoters look to sell a third of the company through an IPO.The shift marks a strategic overhaul for Arcil, which was set up in 2002 to clean up banks' balance sheets by acquiring large stressed corporate loans. According to its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), Arcil also plans to pilot its recovery infrastructure as a service for banks managing overdue retail loans. If successful, this could create a fee-based revenue stream and reduce its dependence on acquiring bad assets.The company also now sees greater opportunity in retail and SME loans, where defaults are rising. Retail loan stress has grown from Rs 3.5 lakh crore in FY20 to nearly Rs 6.9 lakh crore in FY25, at a CAGR of 14.8%.To tap this market, Arcil is expanding its footprint in semi-urban and rural areas, where most of the stress is concentrated. It is in discussions with small finance banks and NBFC-MFIs to acquire retail and SME loan portfolios. At the same time, it is deploying data analytics and geo-tracking of field agents to improve recovery efficiency, while offering QR code-based and UPI payment solutions to defaulting borrowers.The company is not exiting the corporate segment entirely. It will continue to target mid-sized stressed accounts, particularly in commercial real estate, where resolution timelines are shorter. However, its overall corporate recovery pipeline has thinned, with corporate stress in banks and NBFCs falling to Rs 6.5 lakh crore in FY24, down from Rs 6.9 lakh crore in FY22. Arcil has filed draft papers for an IPO comprising a 100% offer for sale.","The shift marks a strategic overhaul for arcil, which was set up in 2002 to clean up banks' balance sheets by acquiring large stressed corporate loans.
