Avg GDP growth rate of 12% must to tackle unemployment in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/avg-gdp-growth-rate-of-12-must-to-tackle-unemployment-in-india/articleshow/124244547.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Average GDP growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing India’s underemployment challenge and a bigger push is needed for a pro-growth, pro-jobs policy agenda to tackle the country’s high youth unemployment problem, a report by investment banking and financial services firm Morgan Stanley has said.“In our base case, India’s GDP will grow at an average of 6.5% over the coming decade, one of the fastest-growing economies globally. But this pace will not be enough to generate enough jobs,” said the report, asserting growth momentum needs to be stronger.The report said to achieve higher growth, India needs stronger growth in its industrial and exports sectors. “Studies have shown that every job created by manufacturing exports creates two other jobs in related sectors like transportation and logistics,” it said.“In this sense, India has significant scope to increase its market share in exports because it is still just at 1.8%, well below its weight in terms of working age population and GDP,” it added.The report said policymakers are already making efforts but the magnitude of the jobs problem means there is a need to accelerate pace and do more.“A comprehensive reform package will be needed, including accelerated build-out of public infrastructure, especially for last-mile connectivity, plus a systematic approach that incentivises state govts to improve the business environment and ensure the labour force is adequately skilled,” the report further said.It said over the medium term, one pressing issue is that AI will reduce job growth prospects, particularly for IT services sector — which has been a key source of employment creation — and for the domestic services sector as well.It said Asia’s youth unemployment is high and underlying situation is worsening. Slowing growth adds to the cyclical challenge; AI and automation are structural headwinds. Policymakers must either make reforms to shift growth models or redistributive efforts to manage potential social stability risks.","Average gdp growth rate of 12.2% is needed to start addressing india’s underemployment challenge.

Kirill Kaprazov has grown up not only as a star rookie but also one of the biggest stars in hockey. His net worth is destined to shoot up since he has got the record breaking contract. The Minnesota Wild star is entering a new financial stage and the specifics of his historic agreement are already controversial throughout the league.Kirill Kaprizov's net worth is said to be between $5 million and $10 million as estimated by Mabumbe. This amount includes his NHL salaries, a few endorsements, and other assets, but we don’t have the specifics on his investments or personal spending.The estimate shows how quickly he’s climbed in the league since 2020, while also considering the high taxes, agent fees, and living expenses that come with being a pro athlete. With his new contract extension signed today, his net worth is set to grow significantly, possibly multiplying several times in the next decade just from guaranteed earnings alone.Thanks to the new deal, Kaprizov's total earnings might go over $181 million by 2034, which includes $45 million from his current contract and a $136 million extension. After taxes (which are about 40-50% for high earners in Minnesota) and fees, his net worth could reach anywhere from $50 to $100 million or even higher, depending on his investments and endorsements.This contract solidified Kaprizov as the Wild's main star and a financial giant in hockey, celebrating his rise from a late draft selection to a superstar.Kaprizov just signed an eight-year, $136 million deal with the Minnesota Wild, which is the highest total value contract ever in NHL history. The contract has an AAV and cap hit of $17 million that kicks in for the 2026-27 season. This keeps him with the team until the 2033-34 season and includes full no-movement clauses (NMC) each year.This setup gives Kaprizov a good chunk of cash right away, shielding him from possible lockouts or changes in the salary cap. The AAV is roughly 16.35% of the expected 2026-27 salary cap, which makes him the top earner in the league.This extension not only ensures Kaprizov's future but also brings stability to the Wild franchise, which has depended on his scoring skills—he's led the team in points for four out of five seasons, racking up 185 goals and 386 points in 323 games. Even with a season in 2024-25 limited by injury (56 points in 41 games), his worth is still unparalleled.Also Read: Kirill Kaprizov makes history as he signed the biggest deal in NHL with Minnesota Wild","Kirill kaprizov just signed an eight-year, $136 million deal with the minnesota wild.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,” Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation.” ""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months.

Trump's $100K H-1B fee creates opportunities, not obstacles for Accenture



Accenture reports strong Q4 results despite immigration policy uncertainty





Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, stating the policy change poses minimal threat to the global consulting giant's operations. ""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet said during the company's earnings call Thursday following its fourth-quarter results announcement.The Dublin-based company's limited reliance on H-1B visas contrasts sharply with many Indian IT firms that depend heavily on the program to staff US projects with skilled workers from abroad. Accenture secured approval for 1,568 H-1B visa beneficiaries in the first half of the year, placing it among the top 25 US employers using the program, according to US immigration data.President Trump's executive order signed September 19 mandates the hefty one-time fee as part of broader immigration reforms, creating uncertainty across the technology sector. The move threatens the traditional cost-saving model many IT service providers rely on.Rather than viewing the policy as problematic, Sweet framed it as a business opportunity. ""Every time there's a big policy change, unfolded over decades, it has usually driven more business for the company,"" she explained, noting Accenture could help clients navigate compliance requirements.The announcement came as Accenture reported strong fourth-quarter results, with revenue of $17.6 billion beating analysts' average estimate of $17.36 billion. The company also unveiled an $865 million restructuring program to realign its workforce for rising demand in digital and AI services.Accenture employs over 770,000 people globally, with more than 350,000 based in India—its largest workforce concentration. The company has steadily reduced H-1B dependency over recent years, with initial approvals dropping from 3,442 in 2015 to just 190 in the first nine months of 2025.In other news, Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning the policy will give large tech companies an unfair advantage over cash-strapped startups in the competition for global talent.","Accenture ceo julie sweet downplayed concerns about the trump administration's new $100,000 h-1b visa fee.

What is TrumpRx?

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as “most-favored-nation” pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.“The United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,” Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,” Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. “Specific terms of the agreement remain confidential,” the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that “Most Favored Nation” pricing is based on a drug’s net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump’s July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid “Most Favored Nation” pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a “Most Favored Nation” pricing policy to address the gap.","The new website is part of a broader push to align us drug prices with those in other developed nations.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don’t forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling. A little planning and some smart moves can turn fuel anxiety into a monthly money-saving win.While the October 2025 fuel price adjustments represent a modest increase, they underscore the UAE's commitment to aligning domestic fuel prices with global market conditions. Staying informed about these changes allows consumers and businesses to plan and adapt accordingly.","October 2025 uae fuel prices rise slightly, practical tips for commuters, families, and middle-class residents to save money.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","Uk prime minister keir starmer on friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital id system for all nationals and residents.

What the new Emirates policy says





Here are the full details of the policy

Emirates customers may carry one power bank that is under 100 Watt Hours.

Power banks may not be used to charge any personal devices onboard.

Charging a power bank using the aircraft’s power supply is not permitted.

All power banks accepted for transport must have capacity rating information available.

Power banks may not be placed in the overhead stowage bin onboard the aircraft and must now be placed in the seat pocket or in a bag under the seat in front of you.

Power banks are not permitted in checked luggage (existing rule).

Why Emirates is introducing this ban

Emirates responds to industry trends and battery related incidents

What passengers need to know before flying

Pre-charge all devices before arriving at the airport.

Use the aircraft’s in-seat charging points (where available) instead of personal power banks.

Verify the watt-hour rating on your power bank; it must be under 100 Wh and clearly marked.

Store the power bank in the seat pocket or under-seat bag, not in the overhead compartment.

Never place power banks in checked baggage.

Comply with all crew instructions regarding battery handling and safety.

FAQs:

Q. Can I still bring a power bank on my Emirates flight?

Q. Where should I store my power bank during the flight?

Q. Can I pack my power bank in my checked luggage?

Q. Will Emirates

provide alternatives to charge my devices in-flight?





Starting October 1, 2025, Emirates will strictly ban the use of power banks on all its flights. Passengers can still carry one power bank under 100Wh in their carry-on but are prohibited from using or charging it during the flight. Travelers are advised to follow the new rules closely to avoid inconvenience.Under the revised guidelines, passengers on Emirates flights will be allowed to carry only one power bank in their hand luggage, subject to specific safety requirements. However, using power banks onboard will no longer be permitted in any form.Passengers are advised to keep the power bank within reach, allowing cabin crew to respond quickly in the event of overheating or malfunction.The ban stems from safety assessments and growing global concern over lithium-ion battery hazards, particularly those associated with portable power banks. Lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries, the core components of most power banks, are known to carry thermal runaway risks, a phenomenon where a battery’s temperature increases uncontrollably, potentially leading to fire, explosion, or toxic gas release.The underlying mechanism involves lithium ions moving through an electrolyte between two electrodes. If the battery is overcharged, physically damaged, or manufactured without proper safeguards, the electrolyte may overheat. In such cases, the battery may undergo thermal runaway, where heat production outpaces heat dissipation, triggering combustion or explosion.Emirates has stated that the risk is particularly high with low-cost or unregulated power banks, which may lack essential safety controls like temperature regulation or automatic shut-off mechanisms.Emirates is not alone in tightening its policy on portable batteries. Other major carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, EVA Air, China Airlines, and AirAsia, have already implemented restrictions on using power banks in-flight.The move follows high-profile safety incidents, including a January 2023 fire on an Air Busan Airbus A321, believed to be caused by a power bank. The incident left 27 passengers injured and led to renewed aviation-sector calls for stricter battery safety protocols.To ensure compliance and avoid last-minute issues at boarding, Emirates recommends that passengers take the following precautions:Passengers who fail to meet the guidelines risk having their power bank confiscated at the gate or denied boarding in extreme cases, as safety takes precedence.Yes, you can bring one power bank under 100Wh in your carry-on, but it must not be used or charged during the flight.Store it in your seat pocket or under the seat, placing it in overhead bins is not permitted.No, placing power banks in checked baggage is strictly prohibited for safety reasons.Yes, you may use the in-seat charging ports available on many Emirates aircraft, but not your own power bank.","Emirates bans in-flight use of power banks from october 1, citing safety risks and industry incidents.

Tips for Saving and Timing Your Gold Purchase





Gold prices in the United Arab Emirates have surged to unprecedented levels, with 22-karat gold reaching AED 422.75 per gram and 24-karat gold climbing to AED 456.75 per gram. This marks a significant increase from the previous all-time highs recorded just last week, reflecting a broader global rally in gold prices.As of Monday morning, the UAE's gold market opened with 22K gold priced at AED 422.75 per gram and 24K gold at AED 456.75 per gram. This represents an AED 3 increase from the record highs set earlier in the week. The surge in prices is attributed to a global uptick in gold values, with spot gold approaching $3,800 per ounce. This trend has been observed across various markets, including India, where 24K gold reached ₹11,547/$124.99 per gram and 22K gold rose to ₹10,585/ $113.52 per gram on the same day.The recent spike in gold prices is largely driven by global economic factors. Investors are flocking to gold as a safe-haven asset amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. The demand for gold has been further fueled by a weakening US dollar and concerns over inflation, prompting a surge in gold prices worldwide. These global trends have had a direct impact on the UAE market, pushing local gold prices to new heights.Several key factors are pushing gold prices higher:This combination of global economic trends and domestic demand explains the consecutive record-breaking streak in UAE gold pricesFor consumers in the UAE, the consecutive record-breaking surge in gold prices means jewelry and gold-related purchases are now more expensive, especially with Diwali and other festivals approaching. Traditional buyers should compare making charges across reputable jewelers and consider whether 22K or 24K gold best suits their needs. For investors, the rising prices present opportunities for short-term gains, but careful timing is essential due to daily market fluctuations. Beyond physical gold, alternative options such as gold bars, coins, digital gold platforms, and gold-backed bonds or ETFs are gaining popularity. Digital gold allows you to invest in secure vault-stored gold online with the flexibility to redeem physically later, while bonds and ETFs offer exposure to gold without holding the metal directly. Keeping an eye on both global trends and local demand spikes can help buyers and investors make informed, profitable decisions in this surging market.Trusted Gold Shops in the UAEDigital Gold Investment Platforms in the UAETo get the most value from rising gold prices, timing and strategy are key. Buying slightly before major festivals like Diwali or Eid can help avoid last-minute price spikes caused by high demand. Monitoring daily gold rates and global trends allows buyers to spot dips for better deals. For smaller, regular savings, consider digital gold platforms or gold-backed savings plans, which let you invest gradually without paying full amount upfront. Additionally, fractional gold investments, coins, or small bars can be a cost-effective way to start building a gold portfolio without a large initial outlay. Combining smart timing with flexible investment options helps both consumers and investors maximize returns while minimizing costs.","Uae gold hits all-time highs for consecutive days, driven by investor fears and upcoming festival demand.

NEW DELHI: A new era in online gaming begins from Wednesday with new law — that prohibits money games — coming into play. The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act 2025, which was passed by the Parliament in Aug, will become effective from Oct 1.The gaming industry, which earned nearly all its revenue from money play before the new law banned it, has pivoted to various new areas in line with the legislation that was brought in to control the spate of suicides across many states by players who lost money. Also, govt felt that online money platforms were being used for illegal practices such as money laundering and terror financing.IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that while money games are moving out, the industry still has high potential with govt’s focus on promoting eSports and social games.The minister had earlier said that online money gaming had become a serious social and public health issue, with proven significant negative impact on society, as he emphasised that eSports and social gaming will help India emerge as a global game development hub.“We have observed instances of money laundering as well as terror support. And that’s why we have kept it.... This was clearly visible to the industry also. Had they taken good and effective steps to prevent the harm, obviously things would have been different,” the minister had told TOI. Top gaming companies such as Dream11 , Games24x7, MPL, and WinZO have since discontinued money games and have moved into new areas for audience connect.","The promotion and regulation of online gaming act 2025, which was passed by the parliament in aug, will become effective from oct 1.

Exception or extension





MUMBAI: As the Reserve Bank of India-mandated listing deadline for Tata Sons expired, all eyes are on the regulator’s stance concerning the holding company of India’s largest conglomerate, the Tata Group Although Tata Sons had applied to RBI to surrender its core investment company (CIC) registration to avoid the listing mandate, the banking regulator has not yet come out with a decision on its application.In response to an RTI query, RBI had said that Tata Sons’ application was under consideration.Sources indicate that Tata Sons has been awaiting RBI’s decision on its application submitted in March 2024, and since no word from the regulator came before the Sept-end listing deadline, the deadline naturally expired.According to lawyers, there are two possibilities: either RBI accepts Tata Sons’ application with or without conditions or gives the company some more time to comply with its listing mandate.The central bank’s FAQs, however, highlight the structural challenge. While a CIC must keep 90% of its investments within the group, current norms cap group exposures for upper-layer NBFCs at 25-40% of capital. This makes a clean shift from NBFC-CIC difficult without breaching net owned funds, capital adequacy or concentration rules, since most of the business is tied up in subsidiaries.RBI says exemptions may be considered case by case if full details are furnished. Tata Sons is learned to be assuring RBI that once it surrenders its CIC licence, it will not engage in financial services that resemble banking or involve public funds.

MUMBAI: The year 2025 is on track to top the previous year’s record for IPO fundraising. Following a record Rs 1.7 lakh crore raised in 2024 through maiden public offers, the final tally for 2025 could either come close to the previous year’s record figure or even surpass that.The first nine months of the current year, 68 companies have gone public through IPOs, with the combined fundraising at nearly Rs 1.1 lakh crore. Another 13 companies, aiming to raise a further Rs 23,100 crore, are at various stages of the IPO process: awaiting listing, open for bidding and set to close this week, or all set to open soon. On Tuesday itself, four companies were listed on the exchanges.Data from BSE and Chittorgarh, an IPO data company, showed that more than half of these IPOs (38) made money for investors. While five companies are languishing at their IPO prices, there are another 25 stocks that are in the red compared to their IPO price.Of the 38 that made money, two — Stallion India Fluorochemicals and Quality Power Electrical Equipments — have more than doubled the money for their IPO investors. In Jan, Stallion India closed its Rs 200-crore IPO with the offer price set at Rs 90. On Tuesday, the stock on BSE closed at Rs 230, an appreciation of over 155% or 2.5 times the offer price.A month after Stallion India’s offer, Sangli, Maharashtra-based Quality Power Electrical Equipments closed its Rs 859-crore IPO with the offer price at Rs 425.

Trump's 100% tariffs on branded drugs: Indian generics spared but pose risks for pharma sector – Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-100-tariffs-on-branded-drugs-indian-generics-spared-but-poses-risks-for-pharma-sector-explained/articleshow/124176474.cms,"Why are Indian generics spared?



Which firm is likely to be most exposed?

Higher risk for major global firms







US President Donald Trump 's announcement of a 100% tariff on imported ""branded and patented pharmaceutical products"" has rattled the global pharma industry, though Indian generic drug makers are largely expected to remain unaffected for now.Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Thursday, stated: ""Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America. ‘IS BUILDING’ will be defined as, ‘breaking ground’ and/or ‘under construction.’ There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started. ""The announcement sent shockwaves across Indian pharma stocks, raising concerns that the scope of the tariffs could later be extended to complex generics, biosimilars, and other advanced formulations, top officials told ET.Industry officials noted that this comes amid an ongoing US government probe under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act, which is evaluating whether pharma imports pose a national security risk.A final decision is expected early next year. The move is seen as a part of a broader push to onshore pharmaceutical manufacturing in the US, reduce foreign dependency, and create domestic jobs.India exports a large volume of low-cost generic medicines that do not fall under the branded or patented category. This explains why analysts believe the tariff move may not disrupt shipments right away.Currently, Indian pharmaceutical exporters are mostly unaffected as the country primarily supplies unbranded generic drugs and formulations to the US, Suresh Subramanian, national life sciences leader at EY Parthenon told ET.However, he warned that if the tariff regime is broadened to include biosimilars and complex generics, major Indian firms such as Sun Pharma, Cipla, Lupin, and Dr Reddy’s could face financial strain.""Unless we see the actual order, it is too early to rule out anything,"" Subramanian added.A select group of major Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers dominates exports to the US market, contributing approximately 70% of all shipments. Among Indian majors, Sun Pharmaceuticals could feel the heat if branded and specialty drugs are included in the tariff regime.The company has steadily expanded its US portfolio of specialty and branded medicines. Its global specialty sales touched $1.2 billion in FY25, accounting for nearly 20% of annual revenue.""The 100% tariff on imports of branded medicine announced by the US may have an impact on the financials of Sun Pharmaceuticals,"" Vishal Manchanda, pharma analyst at Systematix Group told ET.""Out of the company's total annual revenue of about $6 billion, nearly 15% comes from its branded medicine sales in the US,"" Manchanda said.He, however, added that, ""Since there is no fine print on the tariff announcement, it may be premature to comment on the impact. The tariff impact would also primarily depend on what value and from which countries Sun procures these branded medicines from.""This comes as Sun Pharma has a strong presence in the US, with its headquarters in New Jersey and a manufacturing plant in Massachusetts, could help soften the impact.On the other hand, Dr Reddy's shows significant risk exposure, with 47% of its earnings coming from the US market, the highest amongst its competitors, according to the ET report.Nomura projects the company's US earnings to reach $1.5 billion in FY26, making it particularly susceptible to any tariff modifications.Various pharmaceutical companies show different levels of vulnerability. Lupin anticipates US revenues of $1.1 billion in FY26, with their US manufacturing facilities contributing $70-80 million, representing 6-7% of total earnings, as stated by the organisation.India, Belgium, Italy, and China also export drugs to the US but largely in the generic space. The bigger impact is likely to fall on multinational companies from Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, and Singapore, which dominate the US market for patented medicines.US import statistics from 2024 indicate total pharmaceutical imports valued at $212.82 billion, with India contributing $12.73 billion, equivalent to 5.98%.In comparison, Ireland led with $50.35 billion (23.66%), followed by Switzerland at $19.03 billion (8.94%), and Germany at $17.24 billion (8.10%).These European nations, specialising in high-value branded and patented medications, are likely to experience the strongest initial effects of the new tariff policy, according to a GTRI analysis.","Indian generic drug makers are largely expected to remain unaffected for now.
