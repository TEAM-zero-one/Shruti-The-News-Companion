India’s Space Dream: PM Modi Vows To Build Nation’s Own Space Station After Gaganyaan On Space Day

What is a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)?

A rare opportunity for observation

Background: The Chandrayaan-2 mission

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable scientific achievement, India’s Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the Sun’s Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the Moon, the Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) said on Saturday.The finding was made using Chandra’s Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2), one of the scientific instruments onboard the orbiter. The observations showed a significant increase in the total pressure of the Moon’s dayside exosphere or its extremely thin atmosphere, when a CME impacted the lunar surface.According to ISRO, the total number of neutral atoms and molecules, known as “number density” increased by more than an order of magnitude during this event. This confirmed long-standing theoretical models that had predicted such an effect but had never been directly observed before.“This increase is consistent with earlier theoretical models, which predicted such an effect, but CHACE-2 onboard Chandrayaan-2 has observed it for the first time,” the space agency said in its statement.A Coronal Mass Ejection is a massive burst of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona, its outer atmosphere that ejects high-energy particles, mainly Hydrogen and Helium ions, into space.When such emissions reach planetary bodies, they can affect their atmospheres and surfaces.For Earth, its magnetic field offers a layer of protection against these effects. However, the Moon has no atmosphere or global magnetic field, making it highly exposed to the Sun’s activity.The rare observation occurred on May 10 last year when a series of CMEs were hurled from the Sun toward the Moon. This powerful solar activity caused atoms on the lunar surface to be knocked off and released into the Moon’s exosphere, temporarily increasing its density and pressure.ISRO said this direct observation offers valuable insights into how solar activity influences the Moon’s environment, knowledge that could prove crucial as humans plan to build future lunar habitats and scientific bases.ISRO highlighted that such extreme solar events can temporarily alter the lunar environment, posing potential challenges for establishing long-term bases on the Moon.Launched on July 22, 2019, from Sriharikota aboard the GSLV-MkIII-M1 rocket, Chandrayaan-2 is India’s second lunar exploration mission. The mission carried eight scientific payloads to study the Moon’s surface, atmosphere and mineral composition.While the Vikram lander lost communication during its September 7, 2019, landing attempt, the Orbiter remains fully functional and continues to orbit the Moon at an altitude of around 100 km. It has been conducting valuable scientific observations for over five years.The CHACE-2 payload, part of the orbiter’s suite of instruments, is specifically designed to study the composition and variability of the lunar exosphere.This first-of-its-kind observation not only enhances scientific understanding of space weather and its effects on the Moon but also has broader implications for future lunar missions.",India's chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiter has made the first-ever observation of the effects of the sun’s coronal mass ejection (cme) on the moon.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-motors-demerger-what-does-it-mean-for-investors-why-did-the-share-price-drop-40-explained/articleshow/124544495.cms,"The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units.

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on tuesday, with shares opening at rs 399 on the bombay stock exchange.

UK launches first digital ID: Is it similar to India's Aadhaar? Full details of the plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-first-digital-id-is-it-similar-to-indias-aadhaar-full-details-of-the-plan/articleshow/124630189.cms,"AI image used for representative purpose

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The uk government has announced the introduction of digital ids aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Olivia Rodrigo’s manager fuels speculation by liking a reel shading Taylor Swift

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

From Charli XCX to Kayla Nicole : Taylor Swift’s name keeps pulling others in

Industry tension or marketing genius?

The music world may be witnessing another chapter in the ongoing saga of celebrity “shading”, this time involving Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift . After Swift released her much-discussed album The Life of a Showgirl, fans have been poring over every lyric, reaction, and social media move to decode hidden meanings. Now, a subtle action from Olivia Rodrigo’s manager, Aleen Keshishian, has sparked new waves of speculation and somehow, even Travis Kelce ’s name has become part of the conversation.Fans noticed that Rodrigo’s manager liked a viral reel that appeared to throw shade at Swift, and the internet quickly ran wild with interpretations. One fan post that went viral stated:“olivia rodrigo's manager, aleen keshishian, just liked a reel that was directly shading taylor... you can't convince me the industry isn't trying to push whichever narrative they can to bring her down because they feel overshadowed by her.”The timing is notable, as many listeners believe Swift’s Father Figure might subtly address her fallout with Rodrigo or perhaps even reignite old wounds tied to Vampire, Olivia’s emotional 2023 single that was once rumored to include veiled references to Taylor. Whether coincidence or calculated, this social media interaction has intensified the debate about rivalry narratives that dominate pop culture.Swift’s album has also stirred up theories involving Charli XCX, with fans pointing to a lyric in Actually Romantic, “Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse”, as a possible response to Charli’s Brat era.Meanwhile, Opalite has fans speculating about Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce’s ex, due to lyrics about someone being “in it for her phone.” Swift’s decision to send gifts to Teyana Taylor, who previously criticized Nicole, only added fuel to the theory mill.Observers argue that what fans see as feuds might actually be deliberate storytelling. With Swift now balancing her NFL spotlight through her relationship with Travis Kelce and maintaining dominance in music, some in the industry may feel eclipsed. Whether it’s genuine tension or clever marketing, one thing is clear, Taylor Swift continues to be the gravitational force around which the pop culture universe spins.Also Read: Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as critics accuse her of exploiting fans with ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ marketing blitz","Olivia rodrigo's manager's social media activity has ignited fresh speculation about a feud with taylor swift.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined.

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s c2s-scale 27b foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.
