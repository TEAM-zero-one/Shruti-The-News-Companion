Steve Ballmer almost gave Aspiration naming rights for Los Angeles Clippers home arena

Gilbert Arenas almost predicted an under the table hand back in January

What could have been - but the Los Angeles Clippers must be taking a big sigh of relief now that it didn't. The team, back in 2021, when the $300 million deal with Aspirations was signed almost came close to granting naming rights for its Inglewood arena to the company. Thankfully, it never happened and the deal too was cancelled, in less than two years. In light of the latest reports about the Clippers alleged salary cap circumvention controversy, this would have just been used as another nail in the coffin to close this case shut for good.The Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer signed a $300 million deal with the eco-friendly fintech company, Aspiration, and the team back in 2021. And in keeping with the same, he also almost granted the company naming rights to the Clippers home arena. But that didn't happen, and instead, that opportunity was given to financial services firm Intuit, who reportedly paid $500 million, over 23 years, for the naming rights of the arena.The Inglewood arena, which was opened in August of 2024, is now known to all as the Inuit Dome. It includes an 18,000-seat arena with the largest video halo board in the league.Had the rights been given to Aspiration, things would have looked much more grim in the Clippers board room, especially with all the recent reports of alleged salary cap circumvention by the team. Though allegations of the team and Ballmer using Aspiration as a means to pay players like Kawhi Leonard extra money have been denied, this could have been disastrous for them.This whole situation surrounding the Los Angeles Clippers, Steve Ballmer, and of course, Kawhi Leonard has gripped the attention of everyone. The NBA has even launched an investigation on the matter after the report by Pablo Torre was made public. But NBA veteran Gilbert Arenas, who now runs his own podcast show Gil's Arena, had almost predicted a similar situation back in January of 2025.“If I’m Ballmer, I don’t give a f— what that salary cap is. I don’t care what it says, I am cheating it. I got too much money to be on the same playing field with you broke a– n—as. We’re not in the same convo, sir.”He further added:“You want $50 million? I’m gonna give you $5 million on the books because I gotta afford somebody else — $5 million on the books, $45 million under the table, behind the scenes. Don’t even worry about it. I got you. You got a foundation? I got that. You got business deals? I got that. You want a percentage in what? I got that. Just go on ahead and sign that contract.”While Ballmer is very adamant about having done the “right thing” and following the rules that the NBA has set for everyone, it doesn't look like people believe him. Like Arenas had said, under the table transactions are not the biggest surprise, especially for someone like Ballmer, who has a lot of money to spend, even if he can't show it in the books.Also Read: Los Angeles clippers owner Steve Ballmer denies any involvement with Kawhi Leonard and Aspiration deal","Steve ballmer almost gave aspiration naming rights for los angeles clippers home arena back in 2021.

Mark Cuban defends Steve Ballmer, says Los Angeles Clippers owner was scammed in Kawhi Leonard–Aspiration controversy

Allegations link Los Angeles Clippers and Kawhi Leonard to $28 million Aspiration shell corporation scandal

Shams: NBA investigation into Clippers, Kawhi Leonard underway | SportsCenter

Los Angeles Clippers player Kawhi Leonard allegedly received $28 million from a company sponsored by team owner Steve Ballmer, according to a recent statement made by investigator Pablo Torre. Later, details of the alleged deal between Kawhi Leonard and Steve Ballmer came to light. In light of these recent events, Mark Cuban shared his opinions. He still has a lot of influence over NBA events even though he is no longer the majority owner. Uncle Dennis is a name that has kept coming up throughout the entire investigation. He is Kawhi Leonard’s uncle. He has reportedly played a significant role in the six-time All-Star's life after the death of Leonard’s father.As per some publications, Robertson has been referred to as Leonard's advisor. His name appeared in a contract between Aspiration and KL2 Aspire LLC, according to Pablo Torre's investigation. Every ""communication required or permitted under this Agreement"" had to be sent to Robertson. Additionally, he was identified in the deal as Kawhi Leonard's ""designated representative.""Now, Mark Cuban opened up about the whole thing. He revealed how he would handle it if he were put in that circumstance. He further talked about the measures he would take to ensure that these transactions would never be discovered. During a recent podcast interview, he said:""I'm doing everything possible. I'm going to Uncle Dennis and I'm saying check written… Say, Uncle Dennis, forget those guys.Here's $30 million to get Aspiration amnesia and just make this go away.""The veteran Dallas Mavericks owner further said that he doesn't think Ballmer should be blamed for his interactions with Aspirations in light of the circumstances. He would not have allowed the business to fail if their questionable payments were still being made.Additionally, Mark Cuban feels that Steve Ballmer was just a victim of the company's scam. He then said:""As much as I wish they circumvented the salary cap, First Steve isn’t that dumb… If he did try to feed KL money, knowing what was at stake for him personally, and his team, do you think he would let the company go bankrupt ? Knowing all creditors would be visible to the world ? They got scammed by Aspiration, along with many others. Crimes for which they pleaded guilty last week. Scammers do scammy things.”During his show ""Pablo Torre Finds Out,"" Pablo Torre presented a collection of evidence that fueled the controversy. He explained how Aspiration provided $28 million to Leonard's business, KL2 Aspire LLC.It all began with Aspiration Partners, a sustainable growth and technology company that set up carbon emission offsets for big businesses like Microsoft and Meta. In their bankruptcy documents, Aspiration was forced to reveal all of its existing obligations, including a $7 million payment to ""KL2 Aspire LLC,"" a business whose management is listed as Kawhi Leonard.The Los Angeles Clippers will be in serious jeopardy if the new charges against them are true. The franchise has allegedly been involved in a shell corporation scheme that has been paying its star player under the table and below the salary caps for years.Also read: Stephen A.

The messages was sent from his official Apple email ID and was never intended for the public view, but it is now being shared via the Steve Jobs Archive .Apple founder Steve Jobs sent the email from his iPad to his own Apple ID on September 2, 2010. In the email sent, Jobs talked about the fundamental aspects of his existence that he did not create himself. Along with this, the email also mention the countless ways his life was shaped by contributions of others. “I grow little of the food I eat… I speak a language I did not invent or refine… I am moved by music I did not create myself… I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being,” wrote Jobs.The message highlights that Jobs acknowledged the invisible network of human effort—past and present—that sustains modern life. The email concludes with a powerful and heartfelt statement that stands in stark contrast to the often-portrayed image of Jobs as a singular, self-made genius: ""I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.""The email is now available for public via the Steve Jobs Archive. It is a project launched by Laurene Powell Jobs, Tim Cook, and Jony Ive to preserve and share the legacy of Apple’s co-founder.","Apple founder steve jobs sent the email from his ipad to his own apple id on september 2, 2010.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal. Wang is now chief AI officer of Meta.","Eugene ling, a former sales employee at scale ai, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, mercor.

Elon Musk: Tesla’s $1 trillion package for Elon Musk could make him the world’s first trillionaire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teslas-1-trillion-package-for-elon-musk-could-make-him-the-worlds-first-trillionaire/articleshow/123731417.cms,"Elon Musk’s record-breaking pay plan



Targets and milestones

Raising Tesla’s market capitalization from roughly $1.1 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion.

Delivering one million autonomous “robotaxis” into commercial operation.

Deploying one million humanoid robots.

Increasing Tesla’s annual profits from $17 billion to $400 billion.

Achieving 20 million vehicle deliveries per year.

Approval & legal considerations







Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan, which ties his compensation entirely to ambitious long-term performance milestones. The package, if fully realized, could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade, contingent on Tesla achieving unprecedented targets in market capitalization, vehicle deliveries, and robotics deployment. The plan relies exclusively on Tesla stock and requires Musk to remain at the company for up to 10 years to receive the full payout. Analysts describe it as the largest executive compensation in history, combining immense reward with extraordinary risk.The proposed compensation package could award Musk nearly 12% of Tesla’s total stock, approximately 423.7 million additional shares, if he meets the set targets. All compensation would be delivered in Tesla shares, with partial vesting requiring 7.5 years of continued leadership and full vesting requiring a full 10-year commitment. The ambitious nature of the plan underscores Tesla’s confidence in Musk’s leadership and its vision for exponential growth.Tesla has outlined unprecedented targets for Musk to achieve, including:These goals are widely regarded as extraordinary and challenging, pushing the boundaries of current automotive, AI, and robotics technologies.The Tesla pay plan must be approved by shareholders in a vote scheduled for November 6, 2025. Experts note that the proposal mirrors Musk’s 2018 pay plan, which faced legal hurdles, but Tesla’s relocation to Texas may help it withstand scrutiny this time. If approved, the plan could roughly double Musk’s existing Tesla stake to nearly 29%, consolidating his influence over the company’s strategic direction.Financial experts emphasizes both the extraordinary opportunity and the extreme difficulty of Musk achieving trillionaire status under this plan. Observers praise the plan as a strategic tool to secure Musk’s long-term focus at Tesla while also expressing concern over massive shareholder dilution and the feasibility of reaching such ambitious targets. If successful, the package would not only make Musk the first trillionaire in history but also fundamentally reshape executive compensation expectations in global business.","Elon musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed tesla pay plan.

Nepal has ordered a ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and X, after they failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The decision comes in line with a Supreme Court directive and a ministerial meeting held on Thursday that included Communications and Information Technology Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung, ministry officials, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority, telecom operators and internet service providers.According to officials, restrictions will apply nationwide with immediate effect, and the ministry has begun issuing letters to the concerned companies. The government had earlier warned that non-compliant platforms would face suspension.While Viber, TikTok, Wetalk and Nimbuzz are registered, and Telegram and Global Diary are in the process, major platforms such as Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp, Reddit, LinkedIn and YouTube have yet to initiate registration. Officials said services may resume once platforms complete the registration process and comply with national rules.“The Honourable Supreme Court, in a contempt of court case (Case No. 080-8-0012), has issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to mandatorily list domestic or foreign-origin online and social media platforms with the relevant authorities before operation and to evaluate and monitor unwanted content.In accordance with the decision of the Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) dated 2082.05.09, for the implementation of the said order, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has published a public notice on 2082.05.12, giving a deadline of seven (7) days to list social media platforms as per the 'Directive on Regulating the Use of Social Media, 2080'. All stakeholders are hereby informed that the Nepal Telecommunication Authority has been directed to deactivate social media platforms within Nepal that have not contacted the Ministry for listing within the specified time limit and to reactivate them from the same moment if they are listed,” a notice issued by the ministry reads.The ministry added that all other major social media and communication platforms, including Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Pinterest, Signal, Threads, WeChat, Quora, Tumblr, Clubhouse, Rumble, Mi Video, Mi Vike, Line, Imo, Jalo, Sol and Hamro Patro, will also be blocked until they complete registration.The Supreme Court issued its mandamus order on Wednesday, nearly five years after writ petitions were filed seeking restrictions on advertisements and content broadcast via unlicensed social media platforms, OTT apps and internet browsers. A joint bench of Justices Tek Prasad Dhungana and Shanti Singh Thapa heard three petitions together and ruled in favour of the petitioners.In December 2020, advocates B.P. Gautam and Anita Bajgain had filed writs demanding a ban on unrestricted broadcasts, including foreign advertisements, through social media. Manoj Gurung, General Secretary of the Nepal Cable Television Federation, filed a similar petition. The court consolidated the cases before issuing the mandamus, directing that unlicensed platforms must stop broadcasting advertisements and content without legal approval.Government spokesperson and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung told the National Assembly on August 19 that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, was repeatedly urged to register in Nepal but responded that it was not ready to comply with Nepal’s laws and constitution.According to the ministry’s notice, operational platforms must register with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, designate contact points in Nepal, appoint officials to handle local complaints and assign compliance monitoring officers.","The decision comes in line with a supreme court directive and a ministerial meeting held on thursday.

'Scarce resource'





PARIS: The amount of carbon dioxide that can be stored underground is vastly overestimated, new research said Wednesday, challenging assumptions about the ""limitless"" potential this approach holds to reducing global warming Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is complex and costly, and critics say it cannot meet the urgent need to slash planet-heating emissions and meet the world's climate targets.One approach works by avoiding emissions at a polluting source -- such as a factory smokestack. Another, known as direct air capture, pulls CO2 from the atmosphere.But both require the CO2 captured to be injected into rock and locked away underground for centuries or millennia in deep geologic formations.At present, carbon capture plays a vanishingly small part in addressing the climate crisis. But scientists and policymakers consider it a necessary tool to help bring future warming down to safer levels.However, in a new paper published in the prestigious journal Nature, a team of international scientists has sharply revised down the global capacity for safely and practically storing carbon underground.They estimated a global storage limit of around 1,460 billion tonnes of CO2 -- nearly 10 times below scientific and industry assumptions.This ""reality check"" should better inform decision-makers considering carbon capture in their long-term climate policies, the study's senior author, Joeri Rogelj, told AFP.""This is a study that helps us understand -- and actually really corrects -- the working assumption of how much carbon, or CCS capacity, would be available if one takes a practical and a prudent approach,"" said Rogelj, an expert in carbon capture from Imperial College London.To reach this revised figure, the team -- led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis -- took existing assumptions about carbon storage and ruled out locations deemed risky or economically unviable.This included, for example, injecting CO2 below major civilian centres, into zones of known seismic activity, or many hundreds of metres beneath the oceans.The findings underscored that carbon storage should be treated as ""a scarce resource that needs to be deployed strategically to maximise climate benefits rather than... a limitless commodity"", the study said.This storage limit could be breached by 2200, the authors said, noting they could not account for possible advances in carbon capture, or other technologies, in future.Fully exhausting this capacity could lower global temperatures by 0.7C -- but that should be reserved for future generations who may need it most, the authors said.The IPCC, the UN's expert scientific panel on climate change, says carbon capture is one option for reducing emissions, including in heavy polluting sectors like cement and steel.But it remains infinitesimal: Rogelj said the amount of carbon captured every year at present amounted to approximately one-thousandth of global annual CO2 emissions.","Carbon capture and storage (ccs) is complex and costly.

Background: Display ads and competition concerns

Canada and UK also probe Google Ads





European Union regulators on Friday fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) for breaching competition rules by favoring its own digital advertising services. The penalty marks the fourth antitrust fine the tech giant has faced in the EU.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, also ordered Google to end its “self-preferencing practices” and take steps to prevent “conflicts of interest” along the advertising technology supply chain.Google said the EU decision was “wrong” and announced plans to appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.Mulholland added, ""There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”The European Commission began its investigation in June 2021 and found that Google “abused” its dominant positions in the ad-technology ecosystem.Regulators said the company favored its own online display advertising services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers, and advertising technology services.Online display ads include banners and text that appear on websites and are personalized based on a user’s browsing history.The decision comes more than two years after the commission first announced antitrust charges. While the EU had previously threatened a forced breakup of Google, it has held off on that action for now.“The Commission has already signaled its preliminary view that only the divestment by Google of part of its services would address the situation of inherent conflicts of interest, but it first wishes to hear and assess Google’s proposal,” the commission said. Google has 60 days to respond, after which regulators could propose an “appropriate remedy.”Google is also facing antitrust scrutiny in the US, where prosecutors recently sought to force the company to sell its Chrome browser after a judge found it held an illegal monopoly in online search. The US justice department has asked for a sale of Google’s AdX and DFP ad platforms, tools central to both the EU and US cases.Authorities in Canada and Britain are likewise investigating the company’s digital advertising business.",Google hit with $3.5 billion eu fine for favoring its own digital advertising services.

A future unfolding: what’s next for the Armani brand?

The Armani brand: A legacy of quiet power





As the world reflects on the passing of the legendary Giorgio Armani, the question on everyone's mind is not just about his iconic legacy in fashion but also who will inherit his enormous fortune, estimated at $12.1 billion.The 91-year-old designer, recognized globally for his minimalist yet elegant approach to fashion, left behind a vast empire encompassing clothing, accessories, perfumes, home furnishings, and even chocolates.Now, with his death confirmed, eyes are on the future of the Armani brand and his wealth.Unlike many high-profile business magnates, Armani, who never married and had no children, had already laid the groundwork for the succession of his empire.In an August interview with The Financial Times, the fashion icon revealed his succession strategy, emphasizing a smooth, organic transition rather than any sudden upheaval.He envisioned a future where the responsibility for his empire would gradually shift to those closest to him, including both family and long-term collaborators.“I would like the succession to be organic and not a moment of rupture,” Armani had said.“My greatest weakness is that I am in control of everything.”Armani's family members, including his younger sister, Rosanna, and his nieces, Silvana and Roberta, as well as his nephew Andrea Camerana, are all involved in senior positions at the fashion house. However, the designer hinted that it would be his trusted collaborator, Pantaleo Leo Dell'Orco, who would take the reins, serving as the likely successor.""My plans for succession consist of a gradual transition of the responsibilities that I have always handled to those closest to me,"" he had said.Dell'Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for years, is seen as a natural successor in the eyes of many industry insiders. Still, the brand’s future remains uncertain, with some wondering how the Armani legacy will evolve under new leadership.Armani’s influence on fashion is immeasurable. From his first major breakthrough in the early 1980s, when American Gigolo made Richard Gere the epitome of chic in his relaxed, unstructured linen blazers, to his groundbreaking contributions to women's power dressing, Armani redefined elegance.His clothing was never about ostentation but rather about comfort, simplicity, and understated luxury. This approach set him apart from other Italian design legends like Gianni Versace, whose bold, colorful designs catered to a different sensibility.As one of the most successful designers in the world, Armani built a multi-billion-dollar fashion empire that spanned more than just clothing.His brand includes fragrances, cosmetics, home décor, and even a line of chocolates. The Armani name became synonymous with quality and luxury in every corner of life, from the red carpet to private estates.While the financial future of the Armani Group is secure, questions remain about its creative direction. Giorgio Armani’s ability to maintain control over the company’s design philosophy, always prioritizing timeless style over fleeting trends, has been one of the brand’s defining characteristics. But with the passing of its founder, there is a growing anticipation over whether the Armani legacy can remain intact in the hands of those who succeed him.Under Armani’s leadership, the company posted impressive revenues, reaching €2.15 billion in 2019, making it the second-largest fashion house in Italy, just behind Prada. The brand also weathered the challenges of the Covid pandemic, which drastically impacted the luxury market, and continued to maintain its prestige.As for Armani himself, his estimated net worth of $12.1 billion ranks him among the world’s top 200 billionaires, according to Forbes. His fortune includes not just his global fashion empire but also investments in real estate and hospitality. His personal wealth is a testament to the incredible impact he made on the luxury market.Giorgio Armani’s passing marks the end of an era, but the Armani brand itself—quiet, restrained, and supremely elegant—will likely endure.Armani’s own words echo through the halls of his brand: ""My work has one single goal: giving women the inner strength that comes with being at ease, with who they are and what they are wearing.""","Fashion icon giorgio armani, 91, has died.
