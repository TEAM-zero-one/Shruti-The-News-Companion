Back to build

In the Indian startup ecosystem, one constantly hears about how IITs and BITS produce some incredible founders. But there is a large cohort of founders that doesn’t get as much airtime despite quietly outperforming any single IIT when it comes to unicorn creation. Meet the BARBIE founders — those who did their Bachelors Abroad and Returned to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. The term, coined by Sajith Pai, a Partner at Blume Ventures, has gained traction as a shorthand for this distinct founder archetype.From Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal to Zepto’s Aadit Palicha, these founders have moved back to India to build audacious, ambitious and enduring businesses in the country. The numbers speak for themselves — of the roughly 300 BARBIE founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns, a rate higher than IIT Delhi (2.7%) and IIT Bombay (2%). BARBIE founders have started 11.5% of all active unicorns in the country.In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK according to Open Doors and HESA, compared to 20,000 students a decade ago.While this is a tiny minority of the overall Indian undergrad population of 33m students, this number has been growing fast due to rising income levels in India and a myriad of problems with the Indian college experience. Importantly, many of these students are now returning to build in India. Though there is no reliable data on this reverse brain drain, anecdotal evidence suggests that return rates among Indian undergrads are on par with, or slightly higher than, earlier cohorts, likely influenced by recent geopolitical concerns.BARBIEs overwhelmingly build companies targeted at consumers rather than enterprises. Consumer brands account for 37% of all BARBIE-founded companies, followed by marketplaces, fintech, gaming, and other consumer internet businesses.There are two key reasons for this. First is taste and global exposure. These founders usually go to colleges in the US (78%) and UK (16%) that happen to be a melting pot of cultures. New consumer trends naturally emerge from these cultural hotspots and founders are then able to bring this novel flavour of products with a local twist back to India.The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking before eventually moving back to India. A lot of these founders start up soon after moving back, but a fair number also spend some time working in the ecosystem or their family businesses before venturing out on their own.We tracked the undergraduate alma maters of BARBIE founders. Penn ranks first, followed by Stanford, Michigan, and USC. Penn’s lead is unsurprising given Wharton’s presence and its role as an early cradle of US D2C. In India, the Penn diaspora has gone on to build brands such as Knya, Taali Foods, and The Pant Project.Knya founder Abhijeet Kaji says, “What my time at Penn and Stanford really changed was my relationship with time and ambition. I saw founders and operators who were not in a hurry to 'win' a year, but very intentional about building something that would matter in ten or twenty years. That long-term orientation changes the kinds of decisions you make…and how much you are willing to invest before the outcomes are visible. ”There is also a greater focus and appreciation on design language in many of these brands. Founders often come from fashion, design, or creative backgrounds — enabling them to build brands that feel globally fluent but are distinctively India-first.Second is leverage. Many founders come from families that run businesses in the same or adjacent sectors. Trying to build a new consumer brand is hard in India because of low entry barriers and intense competition. These founders have an unfair advantage as they can leverage their family businesses on either the supply (e.g. a textile manufacturing family business enabling a D2C brand) or demand side (e.g. a family-owned retail chain or distributor becoming the first large buyer).Let’s also address the elephant in the room — privilege. An undergrad degree in the US or UK can cost up to Rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme, so it is only affluent families who can afford to send their children abroad. That affluence (and the safety net of family businesses in many cases) often influences their decision to come back and take the risk of entrepreneurship. They’re also bolder in challenging the status quo and often end up creating new markets.Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra showed consumers that you can build an ecommerce marketplace from scratch and deliver products to millions of customers within 10 minutes. Anjali Sardana of Pronto is transforming home services by organising a fragmented workforce with professional standards. Pratham Mittal, founder of Masters’ Union and Tetr, is building a completely new kind of educational institution, focused on learning by doing instead of just sitting in classrooms.BARBIE founders also tend to excel at fundraising. As colleges abroad encourage a healthy dose of interdisciplinary liberal arts classes with all the critical reading and writing training that goes with it, they are able to articulate their startup vision with clarity. In the early days of a startup, when you have nothing but a story, the most creative storytellers are the ones that succeed.However, it isn’t all rosy. They have no access to the IIT / BITS networks that are omnipresent in the Indian startup ecosystem. And coming from predominantly English-speaking privileged backgrounds sometimes works against them as they might have real blind spots about how the long tail of India lives and consumes. This is why you might not see a Kuku FM or Meesho being founded by a BARBIE founder. Finally, some investors are biased against this cohort, viewing them as less hungry because they come from privilege — which can be a fair critique in some cases.While global immigration is facing significant headwinds, Indian students still aspire to study abroad. However, the political environment in these countries discourages them from staying on after they graduate. This dynamic suggests that the number and significance of BARBIE founders will only increase significantly in the coming years.","In 2024, there were 70,000 indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the us and uk.

Indian-origin NASA Astronaut Sunita Williams Says Her First Act In Space Was To Spot India, Home

You are in India after 12 years. What are your fondest memories from the last visit?Being in India with my father (in 2013) is one of my best memories. Seeing where he grew up and lived was incredible. Meeting family and friends in India was also wonderful. Unfortunately, my father is not with us anymore and I will not be going to his home state of Gujarat on this visit. But I am excited for this trip to India where so many supported our mission. I know so many here were praying for our safe return and I would like to use this opportunity to say, ‘Thank you’.This is your first visit to Kerala. Anything special that you are looking forward to?I am excited to see this part of the country! My father told me that Kerala is a magical place and home to many Indian saints. I am also excited about the Kerala Literature Festival. I love that books can offer everyone a way to learn.What role did books, stories and the arts play in your life?Reading was a huge influence on me as a child. I loved animal and mystery books. As an adult, I find historical novels/historical fiction interesting; it provides insight into the people who made history.Your recent mission was supposed to be eight days but became nearly nine months on the ISS. What did that unexpected extension teach you about yourself that a shorter mission could never have?Long missions are what I know, and I have been fortunate enough to participate in several.It has allowed me to really adapt to being in space and perform some incredible scientific research. Nine months is a long time, so one must be physically diligent to maintain bone density and muscle mass. The toughest part was missing time with my family. I also missed my dogs. My family knew I would, so they sent pictures as well as 3D models of them up to me in space. Dogs are just pure beings who love unconditionally. I am so fortunate to feel that love every day. The most incredible thing was how much support and love we got from not only family and friends but also from strangers.When Boeing’s Starliner experienced technical issues and the decision was made to bring you back on SpaceX instead, what was that moment like? How much does an astronaut think about the spacecraft they’re trusting with their life?A lot. The decision was much bigger than Butch (Wilmore) and I. We knew there were hundreds if not thousands of people working on this problem and their expertise was what we needed to trust. We were both happy with the decision. I think the most difficult part was waiting for the decision to be made. Having a clear direction makes any situation easier.How long did it take you to adjust to Earth’s gravity after your return in 2025?Similar to previous flights, but it just took a bit longer to get my running speed and endurance back. I am still working on it.You’ve spoken about having carried items like the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads and even samosas into space in the past. What do these symbols of your Indian heritage mean to you personally when you’re so far from Earth?I took these things and some items from my mother’s family from Slovenia to space with me. I wanted to represent the people who made me who I am. I am very indebted to my parents and their cultures. They have provided me with a foundation that has helped me through lots of trying situations.You hold the record for the most cumulative spacewalk time by a woman, notching up 62 hours and 6 minutes across nine spacewalks. When you look at where women are in space exploration today versus when you started, what’s changed and what still needs to?There are opportunities for anyone who is ready for the task. I happened to be part of the space program during the construction and operation of the ISS which allowed me this chance. There will be many more opportunities for spacewalks on the moon. I am excited for the next generation of astronauts to break all of these records!Your father is from Gujarat, and you’ve spoken about trying to learn the language. How good is your Gujarati now?I am now retired and need to concentrate on learning the language…I will get better and that means hopefully spending more time in Gujarat.Rakesh Sharma famously told Indira Gandhi that India is ‘Sare Jahaan Se Achcha’ from above. For you, what does the subcontinent actually look like through the cupola?India is beautiful from space. I once described the Himalayas as the wrinkles on a skirt when bunched up. It is like earth getting bunched up from the tectonic plates shifting and running into each other. This time around I noticed all of the light infrastructure throughout the subcontinent. It is obvious that so many people live there and how light connects them. I also noticed lots of fishing boats off the coast, like beacons leading one’s eye to the coast.What are your fondest memories of the pioneering Kalpana Chawla?I remember her friendship and curiosity. I loved going on bike rides with her because we would inevitably stop somewhere and discover something — a new bird, or a new plant. There was always something in nature to share with her.After spending months orbiting the Earth, do you believe we are close to finding signs of life elsewhere in our solar system?We will get there someday…","Indian-origin nasa astronaut sunita williams says her first act in space was to spot india, home to many indian saints.

NEW DELHI: India today faces a fundamentally different set of security challenges, driven by rapid technological disruption that is reshaping the nature of warfare, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan said Friday as he linked complex threats to the rise of AI, cyber capabilities, big data and private technology companies. ""Technology today is defining strategy and war-winning strategy,"" Gen Chauhan said during his lecture at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birth anniversary, adding nations were fighting informal, proxy and hybrid wars rather than declared conflicts.The world is witnessing not incremental change but what Gen Chauhan described as ""great disruption"" - geopolitical, geo-economic and technological - with profound implications for the military. He referred to Operation Sindoor, noting modern military operations increasingly relied on precision, speed and multi-domain integration rather than geography alone. ""There was a time when geography defined strategy. Today, technology defines strategy.""He also warned of ""cognitive colonialism"", with societies influenced and destabilised through information operations, narrative manipulation and psychological warfare enabled by AI, machine learning and data mining.""Traditional colonialism was led by trading companies. New colonialism (is) by multinational corporations. Cognitive colonialism will be ushered in by large IT and data mining companies,"" he said, cautioning such disruptions could engineer social disorder without a single shot being fired.Linking these challenges to Bose's legacy, Chauhan said India was dismantling colonial mindsets and building a unified national identity rooted in strategic autonomy. He stressed on self-reliance, military preparedness, anticipation of threats and societal resilience being essential to preserve India's sovereignty in an era where ""might is right"" and ""rules-based global order is under strain"".","India today faces a fundamentally different set of security challenges, says chief of defence staff.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in tripura, odisha and west bengal on account of the birthday of netaji subhas chandra bose, saraswati puja (shree panchami) according to rbi, banks remain closed on second and fourth saturdays of the month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127237109,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1545779,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Gates famously said, ""success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" he's talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency. When it inevitably tanked, i was crushed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-32814,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen huang explains why ai changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs.

8.48 lakh smart meter consumers unable to check outstanding bill due to tech fault,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/over-8l-consumers-in-uttar-pradesh-unable-to-check-electricity-bills-after-uppcl-smart-app-fault/articleshow/127357466.cms,"Lucknow Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







LUCKNOW: At least 8.48 lakh consumers in Uttar Pradesh are unable to view their outstanding electricity bills on the UPPCL Smart App or the official portal due to a technical fault in the state’s smart prepaid metering system.The fault has raised concerns among consumers, as the power corporation has started strict enforcement of disconnection rules for unpaid dues.Due to the problem, at least 5.03 lakh consumers collectively owe ₹212.13 crore in basic dues, along with an additional ₹434.9 crore in arrears that continue to mount.The state has installed 61.64 lakh smart meters, of which 47.43 lakh are currently operating in prepaid mode. An AMISP review under the RDSS smart metering project, held on 16 January, revealed that 31.79 lakh consumers carry a combined outstanding balance of ₹1,097 crore, up from ₹904.16 crore reported just a month ago.Following the review, UPPCL issued fresh instructions to initiate disconnections for consumers whose dues remain pending beyond the permissible limit.Under the new rules, LMV-1 (up to 2 kW) and LMV-2 (up to 1 kW) consumers will face disconnection if their balance remains unpaid for more than 30 days.Reconnection will require them to clear at least 50% of the outstanding amount, apart from arrears adjustment. Consumers who recharge 50–75% of the pending amount will get three days to complete the top-up, while those who recharge 75–100% will get seven days. Failure to make payments within the given time will result in fresh disconnection. This relaxation will only be provided once to a consumer.For all other consumer categories, disconnection will occur immediately after the grace period ends.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Satya Nadella says competition is 'keeping us fit'

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap





During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out. Oh, it's getting much bigger, much more. The TAM and it’s just the impact of the stack is going to be so,” Nadella noted.While taking about customer intent, Nadella argued that the key to survival is understanding the “brand permission” a company has with its users.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella noted.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella spoke at the world economic forum 2026.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

KSI’s YouTube earnings and channel performance were revealed on television during a segment of Michael McIntyre’s Big Show. The moment aired as part of the BBC series’segment, where host Michael McIntyre takes control of a guest’s phone to message contacts and scroll through apps.

While YouTube Studio earnings are estimates and not exact payouts, the number gave fans an unusually detailed look at how much KSI makes from his content. The episode was filmed in November 2025, and the revenue figure reflects only that one month, not KSI’s overall annual earnings. Fans of KSI were surprised by the transparency and enjoyed seeing the behind-the-scenes data that is usually private.During thesegment, KSI was questioned by McIntyre about the YouTube Studio app. According to the creator, the app is frequently visited in order to track the performance of the content.Moreover, the app icon was opened by McIntyre as KSI answered the question. Viewers got to see the total summary of the performance as the icon showed the increase in the subscriber base by 77,100 individuals. On the other hand, the segment reiterated the growth success in the combination of both content creation and entertaining.The TV appearance allowed fans to see KSI's digital presence in a new light, combining entertainment with real data from his career. Although the figures are estimates, the numbers underlined KSI's influence on YouTube and the scale of his audience engagement. It also made the segment a bit fun since McIntyre's usually playful style was well mixed with the behind-the-scenes look at KSI's work.This brief behind-the-scenes look at the earnings and analytics for KSI’s YouTube content provided an opportunity for the singer’s fans to grasp the extent of his success by seeing the monetization of the fame. As an entertainer who has gone from being a streamer to a singer, KSI is continuing to build his digital footprint, providing an odd insight into the business side of the entertainer that the audience might otherwise miss.","Ksi’s youtube studio analytics and earnings revealed on bbc.

Kai Cenat Breaks Silence On Mental Health In Powerful 24th Birthday Message

Cheating claims and assistant involvement deepen Kai Cenat and Gigi Alayah breakup drama





Gigi Alayah has publicly accused streamer Kai Cenat of cheating on her, adding new fuel to the ongoing drama surrounding their December breakup. In a series of Instagram Stories, Gigi claimed she discovered another woman leaving Kai’s home around 5 a.m. She said this moment confirmed doubts she had already been dealing with during the relationship. According to Gigi, she chose not to react strongly at the time because Kai had previously confronted her for talking to male friends, which she admitted was a mistake. She said she apologized immediately and believed it was best toand move forward.The situation quickly escalated after Kai’s assistant, Brianna Lewis, shared messages online that appeared to accuse Gigi of cheating. These posts included alleged DMs, FaceTime calls, and claims of contact with NBA YoungBoy. Gigi strongly denied these accusations and said the messages were fake. She explained that while she did cross a boundary by responding to male friends, nothing inappropriate happened. Gigi also accused Brianna of sharing only part of the story and claimed the assistant was motivated by jealousy and personal interest in Kai.Much of the recent attention has focused on the role of Kai’s assistant in spreading the allegations. Brianna’s posts suggested Gigi was hiding conversations and planning meetups behind Kai’s back. Gigi pushed back hard, saying the narrative was misleading and unfair. She claimed that while these messages were being shared, Kai was still with her, and Brianna was sending him supportive texts without knowing the full situation. Gigi also accused Kai’s friends of celebrating the breakup while previously trying to flirt with her during the relationship.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Gigi addressed rumors linking her to NBA YoungBoy directly, denying that she ever cheated with him. In a video shared online, she said the claims were completely false and based on edited or fake screenshots. She also stated that Kai largely stayed silent during the controversy, allowing others to shape the story online. According to Gigi, this silence made the situation worse and added to the emotional strain after the breakup.Although she stepped back from social media for a moment, she came back into the social scene to give her own take on the situation and defend herself on the accusations made.

Amid reverse migration from the US to India, technology professionals are getting sick of tighter visa rules and higher costs, leading to global talent returning to their home countries and settling for jobs there.US investor Hany Girgis weighed in on the shift in a post on X, pointing to LinkedIn figures showing a 40 per cent increase in tech professionals changing their location to India in the third quarter of 2025.He cited a Bloomberg article which said stricter H-1B visa rules and higher filing fees ($100,000) have reduced the number of foreign tech workers entering US, while some engineers are choosing to leave or not come at all.In his summary, Girgis said the trend means “less visa dependency in the US” and “more domestic tech growth in India”, adding that global talent is “rebalancing, not disappearing”.• LinkedIn data shows a 40% increase in tech professionals changing their location to India in Q3 2025• Tighter H-1B rules and higher fees have reduced the flow of foreign tech workers into the US• Some foreign-born engineers are choosing to leave or not come at all• India is benefiting as tech jobs, teams, and capital shift back home• Indian tech groups say the shift is real, even if exact returnee numbers are hard to quantify",Linkedin figures show a 40 per cent increase in tech professionals changing their location to india in the third quarter of 2025.

What is Nitaqat Programme ?





Overview of the second phase





Results from the first phase





Implementation framework and requirements





After the success of its first phase, the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched the second phase of the Nitaqat Al-Mutawar programme, aiming to create more than 340,000 private sector jobs for citizens over the next three years.The Nitaqat programme is a national labour market policy that encourages private sector companies to hire Saudi nationals by setting sector-specific localisation targets. It is designed to increase Saudi participation in private employment, reduce unemployment, and align workforce supply with market demand.Through a classification system and targeted Saudization rates, the programme seeks to balance business growth with national employment priorities. Since its launch, Nitaqat has been positioned as a long-term tool to support economic stability while strengthening the role of Saudi talent in the private sector.According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the second phase of Nitaqat Al-Mutawar will run for three years from 2026 and aims to localise more than 340,000 jobs for Saudi men and women in the private sector.The ministry said the new phase was developed following a comprehensive analysis of labour market conditions and the capabilities of establishments across various sectors.The focus is on creating quality job opportunities, increasing citizen participation, and achieving a sustainable balance between labour supply and demand.Minister Ahmed Al-Rajhi said the programme was carefully designed to support localisation without hindering private sector growth. He noted that the initiative is intended to strengthen the national economy while reinforcing long-term confidence among private sector employers.The ministry highlighted the strong performance of the programme’s first phase, launched in 2022. Over the past three years, it has contributed to the employment of more than 550,000 Saudi citizens in the private sector.This figure exceeded the original target of 340,000 jobs, with officials saying the programme played a significant role in stimulating localisation efforts, reducing unemployment rates, and expanding Saudi workforce participation across industries.Al-Rajhi said the experience of previous phases had confirmed the ability of Saudi citizens to succeed and perform efficiently in a wide range of professions, providing a solid foundation for launching the next phase.Deputy Minister of Human Resources and Social Development for the Labour Sector Abdullah Abuthnain said the ministry conducted extensive analytical studies covering all sectors and establishments before finalising the new phase.These studies resulted in realistic and targeted Saudisation rates that reflect the nature of different roles and prevailing market conditions, taking into account the availability of qualified Saudi nationals. Abuthnain said this approach is expected to enhance job stability, raise productivity, and deliver genuine sustainability in the labour market.The ministry added that the second phase will continue to support citizen participation, improve job quality, and reinforce private sector competitiveness, as Saudi Arabia advances its broader labour and economic reform agenda.","Saudi arabia launched nitaqat 2.0, targeting 340,000 private sector jobs for citizens over three years.

'Where are 12 H-1B workers? ': Indian-American group says consulting firms operating from home address in Texas not illegal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-are-12-h-1b-workers-indian-american-group-says-consulting-firms-operating-from-home-address-in-texas-not-illegal/articleshow/127284024.cms,"Trump Visa Crackdown Hits India's Neighbours, US Pauses Immigration For Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal

What is the major outburst over Sara Gonzales' video?

What is legal and not a red flag in an H-1B staffing company?

The client's address is listed on the LCA (Labon Condition Application)

Candidate's wage matches LCA location

Employment relationship is genuine

Home work is infrequent or hybrid (local)

LLC (limited Liability Company) address listed at the owner's home does not mean all H-1B candidates work from there

The operating office can be at another location in the same city where day-to-day work takes place.

Both companies are likely linked to Telugus





Indian-American investors and advocacy groups came together to shred Texas woman Sara Gonzales's massive H-1B expose to pieces and asserted that she has no idea how the H-1B staffing works in the US. In her viral video, Gonzales targeted two companies: 3Bees Technologies and Qubitz Tech Systems, and claimed that these two companies hired H-1Bs but when she visited the addresses, she found no office, no work.Indian American Advocacy Council co-founder Rajeev Sharma said it is completely legal to start a business listing the home address, the way Apple, Google, Amazon and Disney did. Legal immigrants trying to work should not be harassed, Sharma said, adding that Gonzales herself might be in the US illegally.Gonzales visited the house of Hari Madiraju, the visa contact person for Qubitz and asked whether the 12 H-1B workers that he hired were working from his house. Hari called 911 and said: ""Somebody is knocking on my door and then they are like threatening me. ... Please, can you help me?""The video stirred a strong reaction from 'America First' activists who questioned if Hari did not do anything wrong, why he did not clarify it and why he instead called the police. James Blunt, a US-based entrepreneur, said Gonzales does not understand how the H-1B works. Staffing companies hiring H-1Bs on behalf of IT companies is legal and an established practise. ""Contracting workers out to end clients is not a red flag—it’s the backbone of staffing and consulting. This is explicitly allowed and commonplace. Calling it “weird” doesn’t make it illegal; it just makes her uninformed,"" Blunt wrote.Gonzales said the phone numbers listed on the 3Bees Technologies website are all Indian numbers and the address mentioned is in Telangana, India. The director, president and agent of the company was listed as Vamsi Krishna Vajinapally, Gonzales said.","Texas woman sara gonzales made a viral video about h-1b staffing companies.
