"ED searches Bengaluru offices of Soros’s foundation, and entities linked to it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-bengaluru-offices-of-soross-foundation-and-entities-linked-to-it/articleshow/119185811.cms,"ED action coincides with heat Soros is facing back home

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President. The hedge fund operator had aligned with hardline liberals and openly opposed Trump.","The raids in bengaluru at osf and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into fdi sourced by osf in violation of foreign exchange management act guidelines.

Elon Musk's X sues Centre for using IT Act to 'block' content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/elon-musks-x-sues-centre-for-using-it-act-to-block-content/articleshow/119250608.cms,"Elon Musk (File photo)

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny. The lawsuit claims this is yet another government attempt to regulate online discourse without judicial oversight.","Elon musk-owned x filed a case against the central government on thursday for allegedly using the it act to block content on the micro-blogging site.

"Indian Army: India Clears ₹7,000 Crore Deal for Indigenous ATAGS Howitzers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-mega-deal-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119234281.cms,"CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","Ccs clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns.

HYDERABAD: Some of Telugu film industry 's top actors were charged Thursday with promoting online betting apps , allegedly luring people into investing in them. Police filed an FIR against Rana Daggubati , Vijay Devarakonda , Prakash Raj , Manchu Lakshmi, Pranitha, Nidhi Agarwal and Ananya Nagella, along with a number of social media influencers, for their role in endorsing these apps.In Telangana, online betting has been illegal since 2017 under an amended law that aims to protect people from financial harm linked to gambling. Cyberabad police commissioner Avinash Mohanty said officers are probing how these apps operate and the extent of the involvement of celebrities and influencers. ED is also set to investigate the actors and influencers. The agency will file enforcement case information reports (ECIRs) and summon those involved under the money laundering law (PMLA).Cops acted on a complaint by PM Phanindra Sarma, who alleged that betting apps aggressively advertise on social media, using star endorsements to attract users.Rana Daggubati responded to the FIR, saying his contract with a gaming company ended in 2017. His endorsement was limited to regions where skill-based games were legally permitted, he said.In a statement, his legal team emphasised that all partnerships undergo careful legal review before agreements are made.

""Smart Indian-American children, whose parents work in engineering or tech, are moving to High Finance. This mirrors what smart Americans have done for well over a generation -when I got my PhD from Princeton in 1994, a former engineer from silicon valley, who moved to a Wall Street job, tried to persuade me to join their quantitative analysis and trading team and I instead took a lower paying job as an engineer at Qualcomm. I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing - probably my father's admonition from childhood.

Recently I have noticed that smart well-educated Indians are gravitating to Finance. This is not good.

We need to apply our talents to solve hard engineering and tech problems, hard urban and rural infrastructure problems, hard health care problems and so on.

‘Wise advice…’ commented users

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has a word of caution for the children of Indian-Americans working in the technology industry. In a post on Twitter, Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance, warning of the risks of an economy overly dependent on financial systems. Vembu said that he has observed a growing shift among Indian-American youth, particularly those from engineering or tech backgrounds, towards high finance—echoing a pattern seen in the United States for decades.Drawing from his own life, he shared how he was once encouraged to join a Wall Street trading team after earning his PhD from Princeton in 1994 but opted for a lower-paying engineering role at Qualcomm instead. ""I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing—probably my father's admonition from childhood,"" he noted.He expressed concern that educated and talented individuals are increasingly choosing finance over sectors like technology, infrastructure, and healthcare, where their skills could have a more tangible and positive impact on society. ""Making money on money feels easy, but a finance-driven economy would destroy society,"" Vembu cautioned, adding that this is ""ancient wisdom"" that should not be ignored.The post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in discussions about the implications of finance-centric policies on societal well-being. “Basically, the essence of engineering in engineers must not fade. Wise advice ! But for grads with liabilities like 1st house, car, & marriage, how do they prioritize their love for engineering over higher-paying jobs? Not yet in college but would love to know your view,” commented one user.“Completely agree with the sentiment. Unfortunately solving hard engineering problems doesn’t pay high money. Something we’ll have to look at the incentives and compensation structures and the ecosystem. Ppl shouldn’t find it an aversion as they have to go through hoops to get the resources to work in hard engg problems.

Kim Kardashian’s history with Tesla



Kim Kardashian , the global reality TV star and entrepreneur, has sparked intense backlash on social media following a recent photoshoot featuring a Tesla robot and a Cybertruck. The images, which were part of a campaign for Perfect Magazine, show Kardashian posing provocatively alongside Tesla’s humanoid robot and reclining in the back of a Cybertruck.The timing of the photoshoot has fueled criticism, as Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, are currently facing heightened scrutiny and controversies. Many online users have accused Kardashian of being tone-deaf, given the ongoing debates surrounding Tesla's corporate policies, Musk’s political stances, and labor-related concerns.Kardashian posted the images on her Instagram, where she has over 300 million followers, tagging photographer Steven Klein and Perfect Magazine. The pictures included:The photos quickly went viral, but instead of admiration, they sparked widespread criticism. Many users expressed concern over the promotion of Tesla products at a time when the company is under intense public scrutiny.The response to Kardashian’s photoshoot was overwhelmingly negative, with fans and critics alike questioning the intent behind the campaign. Many accused Kardashian of failing to acknowledge the controversies surrounding Tesla and Musk, particularly allegations of poor labor conditions and his political affiliations.Social media users suggested that the reality star’s endorsement of Tesla products was purely financial, rather than a genuine appreciation for the brand. Some found the photos with the Tesla robot unsettling, with critics likening them to a promotion of a “robotic future” and drawing comparisons to science fiction themes.On platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit, thousands of users commented on the post, with remarks such as,Another user wrote,One posted,Despite the backlash, Kardashian has not responded publicly to the criticism.The criticism surrounding Kardashian’s photoshoot is closely tied to the broader issues Tesla is currently facing. Some of the most significant controversies include:Musk’s political views and affiliations have drawn widespread debate, with accusations of him aligning with right-wing ideologies. His comments on social media have frequently led to public and investor concerns about Tesla’s brand image.Tesla has faced multiple allegations regarding poor working conditions, including reports of unsafe factory environments, unfair labor practices, and opposition to unionization. These concerns have led to protests against the company.The company has been involved in legal battles related to its Autopilot technology, labor practices, and advertising claims. Regulators have questioned the safety of Tesla’s self-driving features, leading to multiple recalls.In recent months, Tesla has been at the center of global protests. The “Tesla Takedown” movement, which has gained traction in North America and Europe, urges consumers to boycott Tesla products due to Musk’s growing influence in politics and business. Given this context, many felt that Kardashian’s photoshoot was poorly timed and insensitive.Kardashian has been a known Tesla enthusiast for years, frequently seen driving custom-made Tesla vehicles, including the Cybertruck. However, this is not the first time her connection to the brand has led to controversy.In a separate incident, she was pulled over by the police while driving her Cybertruck due to the vehicle’s tinted windows violating California traffic laws. She had previously faced a similar issue in 2013.Despite the recent backlash, Kardashian’s support for Tesla products remains evident through her continued social media posts and luxury vehicle collection.","Kim kardashian posed for a photoshoot with a tesla robot and a cybertruck.

"Ancient Europeans had dark skin until 3,000 years ago: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ancient-europeans-had-dark-skin-until-3000-years-ago-study/articleshow/119254233.cms,"AI generated image

Inference of Human Pigmentation from Ancient DNA by Genotype Likelihood

A DNA study has challenged long-held beliefs about the skin colour of early Europeans, revealing that dark skin was widespread across the continent for far longer than previously thought.The study examined 348 ancient human genomes from individuals who lived between 45,000 and 1,700 years ago, was conducted by researchers at the University of Ferrara in Italy.The study titled """" was conducted by Silvia Perretti, Maria Teresa Vizzari, Patrícia Santos, Enrico Tassani, Andrecite Thema Benazzo, Silvia Ghirotto, and Guido Barbujani.The results of the study show that pale skin did not become common among Europeans until around 3,000 years ago, during the Iron Age. While some genetic traits linked to lighter skin began to emerge around 14,000 years ago, the transition to pale skin was much slower than anticipated, published in Archaeology News Online Magazine.One of the most striking revelations of the study is that for much of the time period covered by the DNA samples, around 63% of ancient Europeans had dark skin, while only 8% had light skin.Even during the Copper and Iron Ages, which spanned from 5,000 to 3,000 years ago, half of the individuals examined still had dark or intermediate skin tones. This gradual shift suggests that lighter skin may not have offered immediate survival advantages, as previously believed.The findings also cast doubt on the traditional theory that Europeans quickly developed lighter skin after migrating from Africa.According to the study's lead researchers, geneticist Guido Barbujani and evolutionary biologist Silvia Ghirotto, early European hunter-gatherers maintained dark skin for tens of thousands of years.While UV light, necessary for vitamin D production, tends to be less intense in northern regions, early Europeans likely obtained sufficient vitamin D from their diets, which could explain why dark skin persisted for so long.In addition, anthropologist Nina Jablonski from Pennsylvania State University pointed out that the rise of agriculture, beginning around 10,000 years ago, may have contributed to the prevalence of lighter skin. As farming communities consumed fewer foods rich in vitamin D, the ability to synthesize it through lighter skin may have provided a survival advantage.Forensic techniques were used to reconstruct physical characteristics and extract DNA from ancient bones and teeth. The results revealed that nearly all Europeans had dark skin during the Paleolithic period (45,000 to 13,000 years ago). However, in the Mesolithic period, which began around 13,000 years ago, the first signs of lighter skin and blue eyes appeared in certain regions, notably Northern Europe.Among the most interesting findings was the discovery of a 12,000-year-old Swedish hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes. This raised the possibility that eye colour could have evolved independently of skin pigmentation. Additionally, Ötzi the Iceman, who lived about 5,300 years ago, was found to have darker skin than modern Southern Europeans.During the Bronze Age (approximately 4,000–3,000 years ago), the study noted a significant rise in lighter skin tones. Individuals from areas such as England, Hungary, Estonia, and the Czech Republic exhibited a combination of light skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair.One of the study's key findings is that the transition from dark to light skin was neither linear nor uniform across Europe. The researchers also proposed that some Neanderthals may have had pale skin before modern humans arrived in Europe, suggesting that skin pigmentation evolved in a more complex manner than previously believed. While lighter skin offered an advantage in vitamin D synthesis, other factors, including sexual selection and genetic drift, likely played a role in the development of traits such as blonde hair and blue eyes.","Study examined 348 ancient human genomes from individuals who lived between 45,000 and 1,700 years ago.

The long-awaited redevelopment of the Giza Pyramids Plateau is nearing completion, with the site set for an official inauguration on July 3, coinciding with the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum.The revamped site is expected to offer a world-class visitor experience, enhancing tourism at Egypt’s most famous landmark.Amr Gazzarin , CEO of Orascom Pyramids Entertainment (OPE), the company overseeing the development, confirmed that trial operations will commence on April 7 to assess the efficiency of new tourism services before the grand opening.As per the online news outlet Cairo Scene, these services include an upgraded visitor centre, a cinema screening a documentary on pyramid builders, and an improved transport system designed to ensure smoother accessibility.One of the biggest changes is the relocation of the entrance to Fayoum Road, replacing the traditional entry point near the Mena House Hotel. This shift aims to better manage visitor flow and reduce congestion, aligning with the Egyptian government’s vision to establish the Pyramids Plateau as a global archaeological tourism hub, Cairo Scene reported.According to another online news outlet, Ahram Online, OPE has been working on the site’s development under a 2018 cooperation protocol with Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, which operates under the ministry of tourism and antiquities .The company previously announced an additional investment of EGP 500 million, bringing its total investment in the project to 1.5 billion Egyptian Pounds.The transformation includes enhanced pathways, expanded parking areas, new bazaar spaces, and an eco-friendly transport system to help visitors navigate key attractions. Tourists will now follow a structured route across seven key stops, offering a redefined tour of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Sphinx, and other iconic structures.Gazzarin previously described the project as a “significant step in enhancing one of the world’s most iconic tourist destinations”, emphasising that the redevelopment will help attract more tourists to Egypt, reported Ahram Online.","The long-awaited redevelopment of the giza pyramids plateau is nearing completion.

"Proposed higher wage for H-1B visa holders may hinder hiring of freshers, scientists and engineers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/proposed-higher-wage-for-h-1b-visa-holders-may-hinder-hiring-of-freshers-scientists-and-engineers/articleshow/119183032.cms,"Potential impact of wage hikes:



Concerns for employers and workers:



Policy challenges:



A new study warns that proposed wage mandates for H-1B visa holders could make it harder for US companies to hire skilled foreign workers, particularly scientists and engineers. The research, conducted by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), highlights concern over a proposal that would require employers to pay H-1B professionals significantly above current market rates.The proposed wage changes, including a requirement to pay at least the ""median local wage,"" could price many skilled foreign graduates out of the job market. The report suggests that instead of creating more opportunities for U.S. workers, the mandates could push companies to move jobs offshore.A recent amendment by Senator. Bernie Sanders to the Laken Riley Act will result in raising wages for H-1B workers by as much as 72% in some cases. For example, a newly graduated software developer in San Jose would have needed to be paid over $80,000 more per year than under current law. The Senate did not vote on the amendment, but similar measures could be debated as Congress considers immigration reforms.NFAP argues that the ""median local wage"" does not reflect real-world pay structures, especially for entry-level workers. In many professions, median wages are based on individuals with over a decade of experience. Requiring employers to pay such rates to all H-1B workers could make it financially unfeasible to hire recent graduates or early-career professionals.NFAP notes that about 70% of full-time graduate students in fields like electrical engineering and computer science at U.S. universities are international students. The research suggests that proposed amendments on wages which would make hiring challenging would drive away top talent and weaken the US workforce in key industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor engineering.The study also raises fairness concerns, suggesting that requiring employers to pay foreign-born recent graduates significantly more than U.S. workers with greater experience could lead to legal challenges.Similar wage mandates proposed during the earlier Trump administration were struck down in court for violating administrative rules. NFAP warns that if Congress moves forward with new wage mandates, it could have similar negative effects, including fewer job opportunities for skilled foreign graduates and increased outsourcing by U.S. companies.As discussions on immigration reform continue, policymakers will have to weigh the impact of wage mandates on employers, workers, and the broader economy. The NFAP study suggests that imposing inflated wage requirements on H-1B visa holders could do more harm than good, potentially weakening the US position as a global leader in technology and innovation.","Proposed wage mandates for h-1b visa holders could make it harder for us companies to hire skilled foreign workers. National foundation for american policy: mandates could push companies to move jobs offshore.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.
