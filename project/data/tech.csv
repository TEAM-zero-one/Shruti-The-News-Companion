NEW DELHI: A new toolkit developed by The George Institute for Global Health (GIGH), India, in collaboration with Rutgers University, US and other international partners, promises to reshape India’s response to malnutrition by helping map and understand its complex food environments.The study, published in Current Developments in Nutrition, addresses how availability, affordability, and access to food influence nutritional outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India.The GIGH is an independent medical research organisation with a focus on improving the health of millions worldwide, particularly those living in disadvantaged settings. Established in 1999 and headquartered in Sydney, it operates major research centres in India, China, and the UK.Led by Shauna Downs of Rutgers and featuring Suparna Ghosh-Jerath from The George Institute, the research introduces a “Food Environment Toolbox” that includes seven practical tools such as participatory mapping and market assessments. These tools were piloted across rural, urban, and peri-urban areas in India and Cambodia.India’s food landscape is shifting rapidly, with growing market dependence not matched by better nutrition.“We developed the toolbox through an iterative process, ensuring it reflects the realities of LMICs,” said Dr. Ghosh-Jerath. The country continues to battle a double burden—widespread nutrient deficiencies alongside rising diet-related diseases. National surveys reveal severe anaemia among women and children, underscoring the need for diet quality over mere calorie sufficiency.The new toolkit could enhance key nutrition schemes like POSHAN Abhiyaan, ICDS, and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme by aligning them more closely with regional food realities. “The tools were adaptable across diverse contexts,” noted Dr. Downs, calling them a “timely step toward more effective, evidence-based nutrition policy.”","A new toolkit developed by the george institute for global health (gigh), india, in collaboration with rutgers university, us and other international partners.

NEW DELHI: The Government is planning to track NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) youth by age in the labour survey for smarter skilling policies. The ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE) has successfully pushed for the inclusion of age-disaggregated NEET data in India’s flagship labour survey — the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS).Starting July 2025, the revamped survey will include new questions to better identify and support India’s disengaged youth and adult populations. Responding to the recommendations of Jayant Chaudhary, minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship, ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) confirmed that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group.“We need to know who the NEETs are—not just in absolute numbers, but in terms of age brackets, vulnerability, and skill needs,” Chaudhary wrote in a letter dated February 5 to MoSPI.While the term ""NEET"" has long been used to describe those slipping through the cracks of the education and employment systems, it has rarely been dissected beyond a general statistic. This is seen as crucial for how India plans, executes, and evaluates its skilling strategies.Responding to his Chaudhary's request, Rao Inderjit Singh, minister of state (independent charge), MoSPI confirmed on May 19 that new PLFS rounds will include two questions: one to track whether individuals are undergoing any training, and another to record education or training attendance for the entire 0–59 age group. The design was cleared after consultation with expert committees and MSDE to ensure methodological consistency.According to a senior MSDE official, the reform aligns with SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth and is critical for initiatives like Skill India Digital Hub and Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programmes.Even a 1% shift in NEET status impacts over 2.6 million youth, and now, India is set to know exactly who and where they are.","Starting july 2025, the revamped survey will include new questions to better identify and support india’s disengaged youth and adult populations.

NEW DELHI: French aerospace major Dassault Aviation has tied up with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) to manufacture fuselage of Rafale fighters at Hyderabad, as part of the overall Rs 63,887 crore (almost ₹7 billion) deal inked by India in April to acquire 26 maritime variants of the omni-role jets.The inter-governmental deal, under which the 26 Rafale-M jets will be delivered in the 2028-2030 timeframe, had included the setting up of a production facility for fuselages as well as MRO facilities for aircraft engines, sensors and weapons in India.With the IAF first inducting 36 Rafales for Rs 59,000 crore and then the 26 Rafale-M jets for the Navy, the French fighter is the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Under the four production transfer agreements between Dassault Aviation and TASL, the Hyderabad facility will manufacture ""key structural sections"" of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section for India and global markets.""The first fuselage sections are expected to roll out in FY 2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month,"" a joint Dassault-TASL statement said on Thursday.""For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France.

Inside Russell Wilson’s 2025 net worth



What Is Russell Wilson's Net Worth? - The Football Xpert

Russell Wilson’s real estate holdings







Russell Wilson’s rise from a third-round draft pick to a Super Bowl-winning quarterback has been nothing short of inspirational. Since entering the NFL in 2012, Wilson has not only led teams like the Seahawks and now the Giants with grit and poise but has also built an impressive financial empire off the field. As he enters his 14th season, Wilson remains unfazed by the Giants drafting Jaxson Dart, stating, “I think the biggest thing is just communication and leadership.” His veteran presence continues to shape both the locker room and his growing wealth portfolio.Russell Wilson's net worth in 2025 is estimated to be around $165 million (Per Celebrity Net Worth ), which shows both his long-standing NFL career and savvy off-the-field ventures. Though the quarterback's journey has taken dramatic turns—from winning a Super Bowl with the Seahawks to a rocky stint in Denver, and then landing with the Pittsburgh Steelers, to current New York Giants—his wealth continues to reflect the impact he's made on and off the gridiron.At 36, Wilson is still in the game, having signed a $1.2 million deal with the Steelers in 2024. But his biggest paydays came earlier. In 2019, he signed a massive $140 million extension with the Seahawks, which included $65 million in signing bonus and $107 million guaranteed.That contract reportedly transferred with him to Denver, netting him $24 million and $27 million in 2022 and 2023. He later secured a five-year, $242.5 million extension with the Broncos, bringing his annual average salary to a staggering $48.5 million before being released.Despite his recent drop in salary, Wilson remains financially formidable thanks to business and brand endeavors. He founded West2East Empire, a creative and brand management company, and launched the fashion-forward Good Man Brand. His entrepreneurial spirit led him to co-own Seattle Sounders FC with wife Ciara and create the celebrity app TraceMe, which was eventually acquired by Nike.Often hailed as one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history, Wilson holds a career passer rating over 100 and has been selected to the Pro Bowl nine times. As the New York Giants get ready for the 2025 NFL season, Russell Wilson is contributing his leadership and experience to the team. Wilson has concentrated on boosting confidence and creating a winning culture within the team since he was given the task of reviving an offense that had trouble the previous season.Russell Wilson’s journey to NFL stardom is well-documented, but what truly sets him apart is how his wealth has translated into a jaw-dropping real estate empire. Alongside his wife, Ciara, Wilson has cultivated a property portfolio that mirrors their superstar lifestyle—and it's every bit as impressive as his stats on the field.In 2015, Wilson made headlines by purchasing a waterfront mansion in Bellevue, Washington, for $6.7 million. Sitting on the edge of Lake Washington, the 10,700-square-foot property featured seven bedrooms, nearly seven bathrooms, and panoramic views of Seattle and the surrounding mountains. “It comes with five fireplaces, a wine cellar, skylights, and a walk-in pantry.” Although it was listed at $28 million in 2022, the home eventually sold in April 2024 for $21.15 million, along with an adjacent lot for another $5 million.Following his move to the Denver Broncos, Wilson broke records again by purchasing a $25 million mansion in Cherry Hills Village, marking Denver’s most expensive home sale. Spanning 20,000 square feet, the estate includes “an indoor pool, a game room, a home theater,” and more—blending luxury with family living.Their real estate ventures extend to California and Mexico as well, showcasing how Wilson’s financial acumen is just as sharp off the field as it is on it.Also Read: Russell Wilson makes it clear he’s still the leader of the Giants, embraces Jaxson Dart competition","Russell wilson's net worth in 2025 is estimated to be around $165 million (per celebrity net worth ), which shows both his long-standing nfl career and savvy off-the-field ventures.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, saudi arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its worldwide developers conference (wwdc) on monday, june 9.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",N nvidia ceo jensen huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

Lisa Kaltenegger’s

Alien Earths

The Matrix’s





Tardigrades are little critters that were around before dinosaurs, and will eventually outlast us on Earth. They are so tough they can survive exposure to -272°C (cooler than liquid helium) and 150°C, which is quite a bit hotter than your pressure cooker. And Earth will be hotter than that in a few hundred million years – not entirely because of your car’s tailpipe emissions. As our Sun grows older, it will expand, making Earth hot like Venus with its middle-age spread. So, we should start planning our escape now. But where can we go?bookhas useful pointers for wannabe galactic hitchhikers. As the founding director of Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University, Kaltenegger is an authority, but she’s got no recommendations, yet. Ideally, you wouldn’t want to travel too far because you are – asAgent Jones put it – “only human”. How long will you live – 100, 120 years? Unless you hit Star Trek’s fantastical ‘warp speed’ – faster than light – you can’t go far in that time. Voyagers 1 & 2 left Earth in 1977, and they won’t get close to another star for 40,000 years. So, space travel’s a bummer. Besides, space is mostly empty. Looking out the window will mean death by boredom. Step on the gas, and a 1mg speck of space dust could destroy your ship.So, speed and time are not on your side.Worse, your choice of space rock is a gamble. You have chosen it based on signs like the signature of its light, which tells you something about temperature on the planet’s surface and the materials you’ll find on it. Say, everything’s perfect, and this planet circles our Sun’s nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri, which is about 40tn km away. You gather bag, baggage, family, and everything else that Moses took, and set sail on your ark. But…that light signal from Proxima took four years to reach Earth. Your data was already four years old. By the time you get there – cryofrozen, probably – in, say, 40,000 years, that planet may have ceased to exist. What then?The choice of your future home is complicated by other factors also, Kaltenegger shows. Maybe you’re looking too hard for an Earth-like planet and missing some gems. You want oxygen? Earth had precious little in its atmosphere till cyanobacteria appeared over 2bn years ago. They could split water, use hydrogen and free up oxygen. That’s how oxygen increased in air. If Earth formed at 12am, atmospheric oxygen touched 15% concentration only at 10pm. And now, a few seconds before midnight, it’s at 21%.So, by looking for ready oxygen, you might miss some good candidate planets. Likewise, searching only for a planet with green plants might be a mistake. Plants on Earth are green because sunlight is strong and they absorb its red and violet wavelengths, while reflecting the green. But on a liveable planet around a red star – whose light has less energy – plants may need to absorb all the available light. Hence, their leaves could appear black!Our next ‘Earth’ will definitely need some getting used to. There’s so much to figure out and fix. But we can’t do that if we make this Earth unlivable in the next decade or two.

RBI eases gold loan 'value' norms for small borrowers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-eases-gold-loan-value-norms-for-small-borrowers/articleshow/121684238.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI on Friday issued revised norms for loans backed by gold and silver, aimed at widening credit access for small borrowers and standardising regulations across banks and NBFCs. The new rules will come into force from April 1, 2026.Under the revised framework, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for smaller consumption loans has been increased. Borrowers can now avail loans up to Rs 2.5 lakh with an LTV of 85%, up from 75%. For loans above Rs 2.5 lakh and up to Rs 5 lakh, the LTV is capped at 80%, while loans exceeding Rs 5 lakh will continue to have a 75% ceiling. For bullet repayment loans, lenders must now calculate LTV based on the total amount repayable at maturity.The final rules are less restrictive than RBI's draft proposals in April. Earlier this month, the finance ministry suggested that the rules could be eased for small borrowers.To make access easier, lenders can accept a declaration or suitable document from the borrower as proof of ownership of the pledged gold or silver. This removes the earlier requirement for formal ownership records. However, repeated sanctioning of loans to the same borrower above lender-defined limits will be monitored under anti-money laundering provisions.The guidelines also ease underwriting norms for loans used for income-generating activities. Detailed credit assessment will be required only for loans above Rs 2.5 lakh. Loans below this threshold used for business, agriculture or purchase of productive assets will not need such scrutiny.For valuation, lenders must use the lower of the average closing price over the previous 30 days or the latest closing price, as published by recognised agencies. Only the intrinsic metal value will be considered; gems and other additions will be excluded. Lending against primary gold or silver - such as bullion or ETFs - is prohibited. Re-pledging of collateral or using it to obtain loans from other institutions is also disallowed. Consumer safeguards have been strengthened. Lenders must follow standardised assaying procedures in the borrower's presence and disclose their valuation method publicly. Auctions will need a minimum reserve price of 90% of the value.","Rbi issues revised norms for loans backed by gold and silver.
