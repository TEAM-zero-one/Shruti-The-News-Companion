These campaigns reportedly bring in $15 million annually, thanks to his clean-cut image and mass appeal.He’s also made savvy investments in fitness tech, digital platforms, and real estate in Florida and California. Combined, these assets add significant long-term value to his overall wealth.Importantly, Cena's philanthropic work - particularly with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, has enhanced his reputation globally.

Intel Layoffs: Intel may cut 20% of its workforce: 'The move is part of ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-may-cut-20-of-its-workforce-the-move-is-part-of-/articleshow/120540598.cms,"Intel layoffs: Restructuring to address financial pressures

Focus on core business areas

Poll Should Intel focus more on the AI sector to regain competitiveness? No, they should stick to traditional areas. Yes, it's crucial for growth.

Navigating a competitive landscape

Intel Corporation is reportedly planning to cut over 20% of its global workforce, according to a Bloomberg News report. The move is part of a major restructuring effort under the leadership of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan , who is spearheading a comprehensive effort to streamline management, eliminate bureaucracy, and rebuild an engineering-driven culture at the embattled chipmaker.The layoffs are expected to impact thousands of employees across Intel’s global operations, as the company seeks to streamline its business and reduce costs. Intel has been grappling with declining revenues and increased competition from rivals like AMD and Nvidia, as well as challenges in maintaining its leadership in chip manufacturing . This layoff follows last year’s cut of 15,000 jobs, bringing Intel’s workforce to 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, down from 124,800 the previous year.Under Tan’s leadership, Intel is reportedly prioritising its core business areas, including advanced chip design and manufacturing, while scaling back on less profitable ventures. The restructuring is seen as a critical step in positioning the company for long-term growth in a highly competitive market. During his first public appearance as CEO at the Intel Vision conference, Tan acknowledged the immense challenges facing the company but expressed confidence in a long-term recovery plan. “It won’t happen overnight,” he admitted, “but I know we can get there.”Intel’s struggles are deeply rooted in its delayed response to market shifts, particularly the booming AI sector. While Nvidia has surged ahead to become the world’s most valuable semiconductor company, Intel has lagged behind, missing out on lucrative opportunities in AI and advanced chip manufacturing.Additionally, Intel has paused key expansion projects, including its highly publicised Ohio facility, once touted as the world’s largest chip production hub. Intel is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Thursday, which may provide further insights into Tan’s restructuring plans.",Intel corporation is reportedly planning to cut over 20% of its global workforce.

The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos.

Donald Trump’s tariffs: Why it could be a key manufacturing moment for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/donald-trumps-tariffs-why-it-could-be-a-key-manufacturing-moment-for-india/articleshow/120542385.cms,"While the coming months will shape the future of global trade dynamics, the temporary suspension of US reciprocal tariffs provides India a unique window. (AI image)

The U.S. has announced a 90-day temporary pause on the imposition of the higher reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners. In a notable policy shift, the announcement came just hours after higher reciprocal tariffs had taken effect. While the temporary pause signals a potential softening of the tariff approach amid ongoing negotiations, the universal 10% base tariff on all imports will remain in place during this period. At the same time, the U.S increased tariffs on goods from China to 125%, citing China’s ""lack of respect"" after the country retaliated by announcing an 84% on U.S. imports.The U.S. reciprocal tariffs on China are set to cause major disruptions to global supply chains, forcing American companies to explore alternative suppliers. This creates a significant opportunity for India to step up as a key trading partner, especially as trade conflicts with China continue. As global businesses look to further diversify their supply chains away from China, India has the chance to strategically position itself as a viable alternative, capitalizing on this shift to boost exports, attract investments, and enhance its manufacturing capabilities.Electronics is one of the key sectors for India to gain with India's exports valued at nearly USD 14 Bn.Electronics play a critical role in global trade, with countries like China dominating the exports landscape (i.e., with a market share of >30%). Though India’s export market share is in low single digits and steadily growing, the US's 125% tariff on Chinese electronics imports, including smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices, makes Indian manufactured products more competitive in the American market. Global brands such as Apple, which already use India as a key export hub, would likely increase production in the country to avoid higher costs associated with Chinese imports. This could lead to a surge in Indian exports of finished electronic devices and even components like batteries, circuit boards, and displays.The additional demand for non-Chinese suppliers, also presents a unique opportunity for Indian Electronics manufacturers to expand and scale up operations and capture a larger share of the global market. India’s strategic initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for smartphones, IT hardware, telecom products, and the newly introduced PLI for electronics component manufacturing, can collectively enhance India’s competitiveness by lowering cost barriers for exports.As a strategic move, the Trump administration continued the exclusion of semiconductors from reciprocal tariffs, acknowledging their irreplaceable role. Semiconductors being crucial for national security and technological advancement, disrupting their supply could have led to significant implications.The U.S. is actively promoting domestic semiconductor manufacturing through the U.S. CHIPS Act, which allocates $52 Bn for local semiconductor production. With significant investments already being made in new facilities and technologies by large chip makers of world like Intel & TSMC, exempting reciprocal tariffs supports this domestic growth strategy. Further, the current global semiconductor supply chain is deeply entrenched and complex, with maximum production already taking place in Taiwan & South Korea, disrupting this network would be challenging and relocating the existing capacity would take decades and investment of very large scale.It is expected that the current pause offers a window for diplomatic engagement for initiating negotiations for trade agreements with the U.S. The pause in reciprocal tariffs aligns with India’s broader efforts to enhance US-India trade relations as both nations actively work towards a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) aimed at doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. To maintain a strong position in global trade and further strengthen its role as an alternative global manufacturing hub, India can look to deepen economic cooperation with the US, forging strategic partnerships and collaborations with U.S. that promote mutual benefits, minimize reciprocal tariff and drive sustained long-term export growth.While the coming months will shape the future of global trade dynamics, the temporary suspension of US reciprocal tariffs provides India a unique window to enhance its bilateral relations. By addressing existing challenges, improving market access to the US, and leveraging strategic initiatives like ""Make in India,"" India can position itself as a reliable global supplier and accelerate its economic growth trajectory.","The u.s. has announced a 90-day temporary pause on the imposition of the higher reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
