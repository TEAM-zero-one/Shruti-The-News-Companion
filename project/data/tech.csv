Shubhanshu Shukla’s mission validates India’s astronaut selection & training: Former IAM chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shubhanshu-shuklas-mission-validates-indias-astronaut-selection-training-former-iam-chief/articleshow/122532761.cms,"File photo: Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla enjoying a stunning panoramic view of the Earth from the International Space Station (ISS).

BENGALURU: For the first time, India’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions, said Air Vice Marshal Anupam Agarwal, former Commandant of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), which is responsible for selecting and preparing Gaganyaan astronaut-designates.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Agarwal, who was an air commodore when he helmed IAM, described Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla ’s (Shux) current mission to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Axiom-4 mission as a critical milestone for India’s human spaceflight efforts.“The entire aerospace medicine process, physiological and psychological selection, is being validated. Not only was he selected well, but also the test standards we developed, the procedures we followed, the psychological selection methods, everything is now being put through a real microgravity test,” Agarwal said.“It is a fulfilling feeling,” he added. IAM’s involvement in astronaut screening goes beyond selection. It collects extensive baseline medical and physiological data before a mission. According to Agarwal, this data is now central to studying how microgravity affects Indian astronauts.“Changes, if any, will be compared with the kind of changes we expect in microgravity. We will study those extensively and try to determine whether our methods for collecting and interpreting baseline data were correct.This will bolster the entire process.”Agarwal said India’s limited past exposure to human spaceflight made missions like Shukla’s especially important. “This is extremely complicated and many developed nations have attempted it and were unable to achieve it. For us, international exposure is the best thing that could happen to this programme.”He added that knowledge about human spaceflight is often not openly shared in literature and can only be gained through experience. “If we want success, we must learn fast, learn accurately and learn what’s relevant.”Looking ahead to Gaganyaan and future Indian space missions, Agarwal said IAM’s role will be critical. “The aerospace medicine specialists are to the human what the engineers are to the spacecraft. They help design the human-use products, the man-machine interface, the safety of crew, acoustic, visual, vibration and acceleration standards, clothing, hygiene products and so on.”Reflecting on his personal experience of selecting India’s first set of astronaut-designates, Agarwal said shortlisting Shukla was a memorable moment for him and his team.“We agreed that we have been extremely lucky in life. The selection process allowed us to meet some of the brightest, most intelligent and professionally sound humans in the country. Shux is one of them. How many people have this opportunity? It was, is and will remain an excellent experience to meet Shux.”","For the first time, india’s astronaut training protocols are being tested and validated in real space conditions.

In an aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore), highlighting the fierce talent war in AI recruitment today. Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world, even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning. Meta is reportedly in talks with several more prominent figures in AI research and robotics, indicating further expansions to the Superintelligence Lab. Zuckerberg's vision now goes beyond just algorithms. It encompasses building infrastructure, supercomputers, and even AI-native hardware to support future breakthroughs.

Connor McDavid needs saving — and Oilers may look to Sidney Crosby's Penguins to rescue his NHL legacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-needs-saving-and-oilers-may-look-to-sidney-crosbys-penguins-to-rescue-his-nhl-legacy/articleshow/122541339.cms,"Connor McDavid’s Edmonton Oilers Could Rely on Sidney Crosby’s Penguins to Solve Their Goalie Crisis (Getty Images)

Could Tristan Jarry be Connor McDavid’s last hope?



Edmonton Oilers must choose its goaltending future carefully



After another disappointing playoff exit, Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers may be forced to confront a hard truth: their championship window is shrinking. With each passing season, the pressure mounts—not only to deliver but to fix persistent weaknesses. This summer, the most glaring issue appears to be in the crease. Now, whispers around the league suggest the solution could come from an unexpected ally: Sidney Crosby’s Pittsburgh Penguins.In the wake of Edmonton’s playoff frustrations, NHL insider Jeff Marek floated an intriguing idea on Inside Sports—Pittsburgh’s Tristan Jarry might be the answer to the Oilers’ long-standing goaltending concerns. Jarry, who still has three years remaining on a $26.75 million contract, has had his ups and downs in Pittsburgh, but his talent is undeniable. The catch? Edmonton would need help absorbing the salary.“I think if the Penguins retain half, I think that there’s a shot,” Marek said via NHL Rumour Report on X. “Can Dubas move Jarry without retention? Probably not, but which team is gonna ask him to retain the least and maximize the return?”The Penguins, however, aren’t just a goalie shop. This is Sidney Crosby’s team, and trading away Jarry—his longtime teammate—could feel like a seismic shift.But with Pittsburgh quietly leaning toward a rebuild, they may be ready to move on. The recent addition of Arturs Silovs from Vancouver, coupled with the development of Joel Blomqvist, hints at a possible changing of the guard.For the Oilers, the need is urgent. While Calvin Pickard showed flashes of reliability, insiders like Rory Boylen believe he’s more likely to be on the move than Stuart Skinner. Edmonton seems more inclined to look for a stronger backup rather than replace Skinner outright—unless a goalie like Jarry becomes available under favorable terms.Still, the Oilers haven’t stood still. David Pagnotta recently revealed that the team explored the possibility of acquiring John Gibson from Detroit, only to be turned down. That attempt signals just how serious Edmonton is about resolving their goaltending issue this offseason.If Tristan Jarry does end up in Alberta, it won’t be without strategic maneuvering—and maybe a favor from Kyle Dubas and the Penguins. For McDavid, who is entering his prime with a ticking championship clock, every decision matters. And if Pittsburgh is willing to deal, this could be a rare win-win in a league where patience wears thin fast.Also Read: Can Jeff Skinner revive his old magic in the San Jose Sharks, or is this just a short stop on his journey?","Pittsburgh's tristan jarry could be the answer to edmonton's goaltending problem.

And as neuroscience begins to validate this approach with compelling research, the message is clear: in the noisy, demanding world of startups, mental clarity, mindfulness, and emotional resilience might be the most underutilized, discover-worthy competitive edge for today’s ambitious entrepreneurs seeking sustainable success and peak performance.Before launching Arta Finance in 2021,a fintech company now backed by over $92 million in funding, including support from Sequoia Capital India and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta spent 15 years at Google. He helped build ChromeOS and co-founded Google Pay, which now serves more than 150 million users across 30+ countries.Despite his impressive resume, Sengupta admits the transition from corporate stability to startup chaos was mentally jarring. “There are days where you feel 100%, and there are days where you’re like, ‘Oh my God, what did I just do?’” he confessed. Startups, he explained, can consume founders entirely—damaging health, relationships, and emotional well-being.His solution wasn’t found in a productivity hack or another to-do list app. It was far simpler: five to ten minutes of meditation a day. “I wish three years back, somebody had sat me down and said: ‘Dude… just meditate,’” as reported by CNBC. That small window of silence became his daily anchor, offering mental space amidst a storm of decisions, investor meetings, and constant uncertainty.While Sengupta calls mindfulness his ""superpower,"" neuroscience is catching up to the claim. A recent study by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, reported by Neuroscience News, found that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation significantly enhanced focus and reduced distractibility across all age groups.Using eye-tracking technology, researchers observed improved reaction times and sustained attention—especially linked to changes in the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system, a brain center critical to focus, memory, and cognitive resilience. As postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim put it, “Mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed — it can literally change the way your brain handles attention.”Founders today are under immense pressure navigating product launches, investor meetings, sleepless nights, and the ever-looming threat of failure. In such an environment, the ability to filter signals from noise isn’t just helpful, it's essential for survival.Sengupta also turns to cycling as a form of meditative movement. “It’s one of the only times where no one can reach me,” he says. This physical form of stillness helps him mentally recharge and stay grounded amid the chaos of building a high-stakes startup.As mindfulness gains ground in scientific and executive circles alike, Sengupta’s approach is emerging as more than just a personal quirk—it’s a strategic advantage. While others burn out chasing every opportunity, he’s choosing calm over chaos. And it’s working.“Ultimately,” he says, “it’s about how you confront the ups and downs of life.” For today’s entrepreneurs, Sengupta’s journey offers a profound lesson: in a world obsessed with speed, stillness may be your sharpest edge.","Former google executive caesar sengupta finds startup life more chaotic than expected.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N nvidia finished trading on july 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion.

MUMBAI: Tesla is finally here. The electric car giant run by Elon Musk opened its first India showroom in Mumbai's BKC on Tuesday. Musk had set his eyes on India since at least 2015, but high tariffs, limited flexibility, and charging infrastructure challenges, kept Tesla away from the country, which the company had described as a hard market.While bookings opened on Tuesday, deliveries of Model Y SUVs, prices for which start at Rs 61-lakh on-road (500km range), will begin in Oct. A 'long-range' (622km) Model Y variant will be available from Jan 2026 with an on-road price tag of just over Rs 69 lakh. For context, BMW iX1 LWB electric SUV is priced at about Rs 51 lakh on-road, and Mercedes-Benz EQA electric SUV costs just over Rs 70 lakh.Users will have a simple 'plug and charge experience' with superchargers adding up to 267km range in 15 minutes. A wall-connected home charger (70km in 1 hour) will be provided with every car.""The Tesla Model Y, available in six colours, is a compact electric SUV with a spacious interior, ample boot space , and a minimalist design. It features a touchscreen interface, 'autopilot' driver-assistance, and over-the-air software updates for the car,"" a Tesla executive said at the launch.Model Y's features include a bumper camera that covers blind spots during rides.At present, Tesla EVs sold in India will be imported and have limited 'autopilot' features - automatic emergency braking system, lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control.Tesla's experience centre at BKC, where Apple opened its first store in 2023, is seen as a way to test the waters with its retail strategy - to evaluate consumer interest and market potential. Tesla is now preparing to expand its presence by opening a showroom in Delhi. It plans to expand to other cities as well.Sources said that in the past, there were reports of Tesla exploring plans for setting up a factory in India, but the talks stalled in 2023. Asked about plans to set up a manufacturing unit in the country this time, an executive at the new showroom declined to comment.Musk has consistently advocated for reduced duties to enhance affordability, the Indian govt maintains its stance on local manufacturing commitments.Tesla regional director Isabel Fan said, ""It will all be 100% ownership and no franchisee for any showroom. Also, India has incredible talent and we are hiring local people. We have brought here Model Y - the best-selling vehicle in 2023-24.""","Elon musk had set his eyes on india since at least 2015.

'India will see $25 billion in IPOs over a year',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-will-see-25-billion-in-ipos-over-a-year/articleshow/122549574.cms,"Representative image

How's the deal-making environment currently?

In the context of MNC exits, is it because of

the advantage enjoyed

by local players?

What makes you confident this will be a strong year for IPOs... as some issues listed below offer price in the previous year?

Most examples you've cited of equity transactions are offer-for-sale. Is that a concern?

If India's economy is doing so well, why is FDI so low?

Would poor Q1 numbers slow IPO activity?

Some argue valuations are unsustainably high...

As IPO fundraising hits new highs, Citi is leading the charge. The top M&A and equity banker last year, Citi aims to repeat its performance with a 2-percentage-point market share gain, focusing on impactful deals over smaller sub-Rs 500-crore IPOs. In an interview with TOI, investment banking head Rahul Saraf discusses the market scenario.Excerpts:The markets are very active and will likely remain so. There's strong activity both on the M&A and equity sides, and each deal has a reason behind it. It's not just about rich valuations. Private equity is churning capital - if they get big investments they also need exits. Large conglomerates are carving out businesses for IPOs as they reach a certain scale. On the M&A front, some MNCs are selling out as they reassess relevance and capital allocation in India. Our job is to identify these triggers earlier than most.It's more about aggression - an Indian entrepreneur's risk appetite is very different from that of a European boardroom.Global firms often face structural constraints in addressing tier-2 and tier-3 markets. Many foreign firms are realising they're no longer among the top players, and that initial advantages in capital and technology have diminished. In 6-7 out of 10 such cases, that's the shift we are seeing.It depends on your investment horizon. Hyundai's IPO - the largest ever in India - is now trading well above its issue price. The market is more sophisticated today. We're seeing a robust pipeline with several Rs 8,000-10,000-crore sized IPOs expected over the next 12 months.My estimate is we'll see $25 billion in IPOs and another $15-20 billion in QIPs and blocks. These are largely driven by private equity exits, MNCs, and large corporate carve-outs. Even if valuations stay flat, these transactions will continue, because they are strategically important and there is no issue in terms of demand for quality companies. The only question is what price.That's the current trend. The traditional view was that IPOs should raise primary capital for growth. Now, investors are comfortable if the company is already well-capitalised. Private equity exits via OFS are accepted if the company doesn't need new funds. The key is that high-quality paper is entering the market, deepening it. Some ask, is there a valuation froth? But that is because there is a liquidity trap in India as money cannot go out of the country leading to a lot of domestic liquidity. If India continues to grow as planned, as and when quality paper comes in, those excesses in some pockets will get evened out.Private equity and sovereign wealth funds will continue to invest in India - they're financial investors, focused on returns and exit multiples. But for strategic investors, it's different. Their decisions depend on available cash, strategic relevance of investing in India, shareholder expectations, and whether capital can be deployed more efficiently elsewhere.It's hard to predict the market in the short term. Fundamentals matter over 12-36 months, but markets move minute by minute. If Q1 is soft, there may be some temporary impact. But the long-term trajectory matters more. If the broader economy remains on track, short-term volatility won't derail IPOs. Liquidity is abundant, and markets look ahead, not behind.A weak quarter might delay an IPO or impact valuation in a specific case, but overall activity should remain strong. Even if markets stay flat for a year, IPOs will continue.Valuations are always relative. From a European lens, India looks expensive. But peers in India may trade at 20x earnings, so 15x here isn't high. India's valuations have risen due to consistent flows, growth, and political stability. Today we're at 21-22x, compared to a 20-year average of 18x - not excessive. In contrast, some global markets have de-rated sharply. India's higher multiples reflect its stronger outlook.","Citi aims to repeat its performance with a 2-percentage-point market share gain.

The announcement signals an escalation in his broader “reciprocal tariff” strategy, set to formally take effect from 1 August.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday (local time) after attending an AI summit in Pittsburgh, Trump said, “Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff.”He added that tariffs on semiconductors were on a “similar” timeline and would be “less complicated” to enforce, Bloomberg reported.Earlier this month, Trump had already pledged a 50% tariff on copper and warned that pharmaceutical tariffs could rise as high as 200% after a one-year grace period for companies to shift production back to the US.His administration is pursuing these tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, claiming that the volume of drug imports poses a national security threat.If enacted, the pharmaceutical levies could directly impact multinational drugmakers such as Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, who rely heavily on overseas production. Meanwhile, chip tariffs are expected to affect not only semiconductor manufacturers but also consumer tech giants like Apple and Samsung, potentially driving up prices for smartphones and laptops.The threat comes as Trump has issued tariff letters to several trading partners in recent days, outlining import duties unilaterally, though he insists negotiations are still on the table.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump also announced a revised deal with Indonesia, cutting its proposed tariff rate from 32% to 19%, in exchange for multibillion-dollar US purchases, including 50 Boeing aircraft.",Us president donald trump said that he is likely to impose tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals by the end of the month.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann watson, a former citigroup employee, was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with indians.
