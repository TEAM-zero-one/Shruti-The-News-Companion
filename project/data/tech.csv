‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

‘Tech Produces Great Value, But Also Turmoil’

BENGALURU: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said even as artificial intelligence technology produces great value, it will also bring big economic turmoil. So it is important, he said, to ensure everyone shares in the benefits, and urged India, as the world's largest democracy, to use AI to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric. ""That's a really valuable use of the technology,"" Amodei said at the maiden edition of Anthropic's Builder Summit in Bengaluru on Monday.Anthropic, valued at $380 billion and whose AI products are used widely by enterprises to make coding more efficient, recently launched a slew of new tools for other enterprise functions like legal, sales and marketing that caused a collapse in the share prices of software and IT services companies around the world.Amodei's visit coincided with the AI company launching its Bengaluru operations. Speaking to some 250 developers and entrepreneurs, he noted that the technical intensity of AI adoption in India tends to be higher than elsewhere. He said he's heard ministry of statistics is building an AI system to query economic data and statistics. ""Generally, govt bodies elsewhere don't move this fast,"" he said.Anthropic's business run rate revenue in India, he said, has doubled over the past four months.""It's just really incredible... It mirrors the general progress and explosion in Claude models and coding models. But I think it's even more extreme in India than we've seen in other places of the world.""Amodei also pointed to India's extraordinary scale as a catalyst for innovation. ""You can run experiments with hundreds of millions of people. That scale allows entrepreneurs and builders to pivot quickly and learn faster in ways that simply aren't possible in smaller markets.""He said India's linguistic diversity as a powerful driver for AI innovation. It enables, he said, building tools interoperate across languages, make translation easier, and enable true multilingual capabilities. Claude, he said, is working hard to support the long tail of languages, and ""with so many regional languages in India, I've seen some cool applications, including in the non-profit and social benefit space. ""On the philosophy of his 38-page essay 'The Adolescence of Technology', Amodei said, ""We need to understand that this technology is really going to change the world at a speed and to a degree that we haven't seen with any other technology before. That may sound hyperbolic, but if we look at the rate of improvement, diffusion, and adoption, it's something that has no real precedent in modern history."" The essay emphasises core principles aimed at protecting against the worst-case risks posed by AI.Amodei highlighted the transformative potential of AI in specialised fields such as medicine and biology, noting that innovations rooted in the physical world are likely to create the most defensible businesses. ""I really encourage people to build where AI intersects with areas like medicine and health. The biggest moats will come from applications tied to the physical world - things that aren't easy to do and require specialised skills. Biology and medicine fit all of those criteria. It's a complex, knowledge-heavy space that involves navigating regulatory systems, but that hard work will lead to durable businesses. So I strongly encourage builders to move in that direction.""","Anthropic ceo dario amodei urged india, as the world's largest democracy, to use ai to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric. He spoke at the maiden edition of anthropic's builder summit in bengaluru on monday. The visit coincided with the ai company launching its bengaluru operations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128438612,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-7984,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The AI Impact Summit 2026 marks a shift in India's AI story - from cloud-heavy, software-led narratives to physical, deployable AI embedded in machines, devices and infrastructure.Spread across 70,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam at the national capital, the summit is less about future promises and more about AI already at work: robots in healthcare and factories, drones in farms, and wearables in public services.Inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the five-day summit, from Feb 16 to 20, brings together over 300 curated pavilions and over 600 startups cutting across sectors. The emphasis throughout the exhibition floor is on deployment rather than demos. Autonomous drones scan crops for disease, wearable devices assist frontline health workers, industrial robots demonstrate predictive maintenance, and AI-powered tools translate court judgments and govt documents into Indian languages.Global technology giants have mounted some of the largest and most crowded showcases. Google's pavilion highlights applications ranging from climate modelling and extreme weather prediction to language tools and its AI cricket coach, tailored for Indian users.Microsoft is showcasing secure AI platforms for governance, public services and enterprise adoption, while Nvidia has drawn steady crowds with live demonstrations of GPU-powered robotics, real-time simulations and industrial AI systems, underlining the growing importance of high-performance computing. Open AI, Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services, and Schneider Electric are also present, positioning their platforms for large, diverse markets such as India, with a sharp focus on scale, cost efficiency and compliance.Equally prominent is the presence of India's own tech majors. Tata Group's showcase spans manufacturing, mobility and digital public infrastructure, demonstrating how AI is being integrated into traditional industries. HCL Tech has focused on enterprise AI, secure data systems and responsible deployment frameworks, while Reliance Industries is highlighting applications in telecom, retail and cloud infrastructure.The summit's international character is reinforced by country pavilions from Japan, the UK, and Germany, hosting live demonstrations and bilateral discussions. Senior members of global technology firms are attending closed door sessions and public interactions, using the platform to explore partnerships and policy alignment in one of the world's fastest-growing AI markets.Despite the heavy presence of big tech, the energy on the floor is driven just as much by startups, students and young innovators. Youth zones are packed with school and college teams presenting solutions for precision farming, healthcare diagnostics, climate resilience and education, many designed to work offline or in regional languages. ""Cost is our biggest constraint,"" said Shashwat Ranjan, a computer science student developing an AI-based mental health tool. ""Running models for college projects is expensive. Being here helps us understand how to build affordable systems that can actually scale.""Several pavilions highlight indigenous foundation models trained on Indian datasets and designed to support all 22 official languages, backed by domestic compute infrastructure and governed by local data protection frameworks. Officials say the aim is to ensure AI systems reflect Indian realities and remain accessible to startups, researchers and public institutions.",The ai impact summit 2026 marks a shift in india's ai story.

'From 25 Years To 5’ Rajnath Singh Pushes DRDO With 5-Year Ultimatum On 5th And 6th Gen Engines

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday set a deadline of 5-7 years for DRDO scientists to develop the 6th generation aero engine for fighter aircraft.Describing aero engine development as a complex integration of thermodynamics, materials science, fluid mechanics and advanced mechanical engineering, Rajnath said even advanced countries take 25 to 30 years to develop next-generation engines. Urging Indian scientists to compress timelines in view of strategic requirements, the minister said, “We must assume that 20 years have already passed and we now have only 5–7 years left.”The minister said this while visiting DRDO’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) in Bengaluru and also witnessed the full afterburner engine test of the Kaveri engine, a much-delayed indigenous project that is being developed for the advanced fighter jets.Rajnath said, “We are rapidly moving towards the design and development of the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). We have made numerous attempts in the past to achieve expertise in the field of aero engines. Now, the time has come to complete those efforts. We cannot limit ourselves to only 5th generation engines. We must begin the development of the 6th generation. Research on them is the need of the hour. The use of AI, machine learning and new materials is increasing.We must stay ahead of the curve.”Recently, three consortia — Tata, L&T (with BEL & Dynamatic Technologies) and Bharat Forge (with BEML & Data Patterns)— have reportedly been shortlisted for the AMCA project. The final partner will work with the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) to build five AMCA prototypes by 2031 with the ministry’s initial allocation of Rs 15,000-crore.Rajnath described DRDO as the foundation of India’s strategic capability and stressed the need to achieve Aatmanirbharta in aero engine technology. “Supply chains are breaking and new ecosystems are developing. Nations possessing indigenous critical technologies will remain safe, secure and sustain themselves,” he said. The minister also launched the mountain fire control radar and flagged off the improved Akash weapon system from Bharat Electronics Ltd in Bengaluru.On Tuesday, the defence minister and his French minister of defence Catherine Vautrin, who is arriving in Bengaluru early Tuesday for the “India France Annual Bilateral Dailogue”, will inaugurate the Tata Advanced Systems’ final assembly line for the Airbus H125 helicopter in Kolar.He also welcomed joint studies with the UK and France under the National Aero Engine Mission, stating that such partnerships would help India understand technological challenges while building domestic capability.",Defence minister rajnath singh on monday set a deadline of 5-7 years for drdo scientists to develop the 6th generation aero engine for fighter aircraft.

NEW DELHI: In a significant step towards regulating and scaling artificial intelligence in public healthcare, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda will on Tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives — a policy roadmap and a testing platform — aimed at ensuring AI tools are safe, accountable and ready for real-world deployment.At the India AI Summit at Bharat Mandapam, Nadda will unveil the Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare for India (SAHI) and BODH, the Benchmarking Open Data Platform for Health AI.SAHI lays down the country’s first structured framework to guide how AI should be integrated into hospitals, public health programmes and digital health systems. The strategy makes clear that AI must assist doctors and health workers, not replace them, and should operate within clear guardrails of transparency, accountability and equity. It sets out a national direction on governance, data stewardship, validation standards and responsible deployment, while encouraging innovation aligned with public health priorities.Alongside it, BODH is designed as a national evaluation platform to test AI tools before they are rolled out at scale. Developed by IIT Kanpur in collaboration with the National Health Authority under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, the platform allows AI models to be benchmarked on diverse, real-world health data without sharing or exposing patient information.The aim is to ensure that AI systems perform reliably across different hospitals, regions and patient populations.Officials say the twin initiatives mark a shift from experimentation to structured oversight, as AI tools increasingly enter areas such as diagnostics, clinical decision support, claims management and disease surveillance. By combining a national policy framework with a privacy-preserving testing mechanism, the government is seeking to balance innovation with safety in one of the most sensitive sectors — healthcare.The launches come amid the five-day India AI Summit 2026, being hosted in the Global South for the first time, where health AI has emerged as a key pillar of India’s digital public infrastructure push.",Health minister jagat prakash nadda will on tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives.

BENGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday visited DRDO’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) in Bengaluru, where he reviewed the progress of indigenous military gas turbine engine programmes, including the long-running, much-delayed Kaveri engine project.On Tuesday, Singh, along with French minister of defence Catherine Vautrin, will inaugurate the Tata Advanced Systems’ final assembly line for the Airbus H125 helicopter in Kolar. Vautrin, who is arriving in Bengaluru early Tuesday for the “India France Annual Bilateral Dailogue”, is expected to receive a formal guard of honour along with Singh at the HAL airport here.During the visit on Monday, Singh called on GTRE to focus on next-generation propulsion systems and build a nationwide ecosystem to support advanced engine development. Referring to India’s plans for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), he said the country must move beyond fifth-generation capabilities.“We cannot limit ourselves to only 5th generation engines. We must begin the development of 6th generation, advanced technologies as soon as possible,” he said, highlighting the growing role of AI, machine learning and new materials in propulsion technologies.Describing aero engine development as a complex integration of thermodynamics, materials science, fluid mechanics and advanced mechanical engineering, Singh noted that even advanced nations take 25 to 30 years to develop next-generation engines.He urged Indian scientists to compress timelines in view of strategic requirements.“We must assume that 20 years have already passed and we now have only 5–7 years left,” he said. Referring to Operation Sindoor, he said the armed forces had demonstrated growing self-reliance through the use of indigenous communication systems, surveillance equipment and weapon platforms. He also welcomed joint studies with the UK and France under the National Aero Engine Mission, stating that such partnerships would help India understand technological challenges while building domestic capability.Singh was briefed on ongoing engine development efforts, collaboration with Indian industry, academia and research institutions, and the technical support extended to the armed forces. Singh toured an exhibition of indigenously developed engines and components and witnessed a full afterburner engine test of the Kaveri engine, a key milestone in India’s push for aero engine self-reliance.Interacting with scientists and officials, Singh described DRDO as the foundation of India’s strategic capability and stressed the need to achieve Aatmanirbharta in aero engine technology amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. “Supply chains are breaking and new ecosystems are developing. Nations possessing indigenous critical technologies will remain safe, secure and sustain themselves,” he said, reiterating the govt’s commitment to self-reliance.Secretary, department of defence R&D and DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat, along with senior GTRE scientists and officials, were present during the visit.","Defence minister rajnath singh monday visited drdo’s gas turbine research establishment (gtre) in bengaluru.

Candace Owens questions Erika Kirk’s role in The Charlie Kirk Show Spotify, Apple, and YouTube removal

From Viral Clip To Trust Crisis: Erika Kirk Faces Mounting Backlash | WATCH





Candace Owens has sparked a fresh debate inside conservative media. She publicly questioned whether Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, ordered the removal of The Charlie Kirk Show from major streaming platforms. Owens claimed the podcast archive disappeared from Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube soon after Erika Kirk stepped into a leadership role at Turning Point USA following her husband’s death. Listeners quickly checked for themselves. Many confirmed that full past episodes no longer appear on Spotify or Apple Podcasts. The show’s YouTube presence is also limited, with full archives missing.However, episodes are still available on Rumble and on the official Turning Point USA website. So the show has not vanished completely. The real question now: who made the decision, and why? Candace Owens wrote online, “Not to be awkward, but one of the early actions his wife took as the new CEO was to have ALL of the Charlie Kirk Show episodes removed from Spotify, Apple, and YouTube.” Her statement led to strong reactions from supporters and critics alike.Candace Owens suggested the removals were unlikely to be random.She argued that multiple platforms taking down the same content at the same time “strongly suggested organisational direction.” When a user told her she had provided “zero evidence,” Owens did not step back. Instead, she pointed to the timing and said the situation raised fair concerns.As of now, there is no verified proof showing that Erika Kirk directly instructed Spotify, Apple, or YouTube to remove the podcast. None of the three platforms has released a public statement explaining the change. Turning Point USA has also not issued a detailed clarification about who requested the removal.A Turning Point USA affiliate reportedly told supporters in an email that the situation was “a product of how they choose to handle shows like ours with a high number of episodes.” That message suggested platform management policies could have played a role. Some supporters have also mentioned possible contract issues involving Salem Media Group, which previously distributed the show. Still, there is no official confirmation tying any single reason to the removal.Charlie Kirk died on September 10, 2025, after a fatal shooting during a campus event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Authorities later arrested a suspect in connection with the case. Since then, leadership decisions at Turning Point USA have faced closer attention. Owens has openly criticised certain moves made after his death.Erika Kirk has not publicly responded to Owens’ latest comments. For now, the podcast remains available on alternative platforms, while debate continues over who controls its distribution and why it left mainstream streaming services.","Candace owens questioned whether erika kirk ordered the removal of the charlie kirk show from major streaming platforms.

Ethan Klein’s net worth and podcast success draw attention as online discussion grows





A billboard in Los Angeles referencing past controversy involving James Charles has sparked fresh online discussion, and podcaster Ethan Klein has now responded to the attention it received. The topic is leading many viewers to revisit Klein’s commentary and ask questions about his career success and net worth. The moment shows how internet conversations can return suddenly and draw wide public interest again.During a recent episode of his podcast, Ethan Klein reacted to the billboard and the sudden wave of attention surrounding it. He said he was surprised at how quickly a local display turned into a widely discussed online topic.According to Klein, internet culture moves fast but often repeats itself, bringing older stories back into focus when people least expect it.He told viewers, “The internet moves fast, but somehow it always circles back.” His comments were calm and focused more on how social media works rather than adding fresh conflict.He said that once something starts trending online, it may rapidly engage viewers far outside the initial setting.Fans on several channels posted excerpts from the podcast together with their own thoughts and responses.The initial point began a larger conversation about how digital audiences watch content which impacts storytelling and how authors approach the renewed interest in historical themes. The situation showed that podcast debates could develop into major online conflicts after a few hours of discussion.The public became more interested in Ethan Klein's work through the expanding discussions about billboards. The audience started to research his financial net worth and professional growth from his initial performance until his present success.Klein first gained popularity through YouTube before expanding into long-form podcasting with the H3 Podcast, which now attracts a steady audience and regular sponsorship support.The combination of his interview-based content with his commentary work has enabled him to maintain his digital media presence. The internet sources provide different value assessments yet multiple estimates show his net worth exists within the multi-million-dollar range which derives mainly from his podcast revenue and brand partnerships and online content.The current interest in public discussion shows how quickly people shift their attention from one event to investigate a creator's influence and business achievements. The research demonstrates that online personalities receive public attention for both their ideas and the professional networks which they build through their online communities.",A billboard in los angeles referencing past controversy involving james charles has sparked fresh online discussion.

MacKenzie Scott donated $26 billion over the past seven years, including a record $7.2 billion in 2025, a pace of giving that makes her the third-largest philanthropist of all time by total lifetime donations, according to Forbes.Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. She has distributed the funds primarily through large, unrestricted grants to non-profit organisations across the United States and internationally. Her total giving since 2019 now stands at $26 billion, according to publicly disclosed figures compiled by philanthropy trackers and financial publications.The $7.2 billion she gave in 2025 marks the largest single-year amount of her philanthropic career. The record year accelerated her overall total and pushed her ahead of most living donors in cumulative lifetime contributions.With $26 billion in lifetime giving, Scott ranks as the third-biggest philanthropist of all time in absolute dollars donated. Only two individuals in modern history have given more in total lifetime contributions.Her 2025 giving alone exceeded the combined lifetime donations of several prominent billionaires, including Tesla and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, Google co-founder Larry Page, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and her former husband Jeff Bezos.Scott’s philanthropic strategy has differed from many large-scale donors.

She has since sold portions of those shares to fund her charitable donations.The comparison is based on the total amounts Musk, Page, Ellison and Bezos have publicly donated over their lifetimes. Although they have promised large sums and set up charity foundations, the money they have actually given so far is still less than what Scott donated in 2025 alone.Scott has not publicly indicated a fixed end date for her giving.

Alix Earle makes a cryptic post as Tom Brady stays silent



What happened between Tom Brady and 25 year old popular influencer, Alix Earle, after they were spotted together in December?



Tom Brady, the NFL legend, has dominated headlines over the last few years as he has strictly stayed away from any serious relationships in the public eye after his messy divorce in 2022.But now, he has been linked to the 25 year old influencer, Alix Earle, after the two were spotted getting close at two separate parties. Amid all the rumors of a potential romance brewing between the two, Alix Earle has shared a cryptic post.Just a few hours ago, the popular social media influencer and podcast host Alix Earle, took to her social media to post a few stunning pictures of herself in a shimmery gold mini dress from Gucci, which she paired with black stockings.While Alix Earle looks beautiful, the caption of the post reads as, “Cupid told me to just sit and look pretty…” and it has raised eyebrows considering her rumored romance with Tom Brady.Interestingly, the Super Bowl champion Tom Brady shared a post with his children, Bejamin and Vivian, from Switzerland as he credited them and his other son, Jack, for being his Valentine.It is not confirmed if Tom Brady was on a trip to Switzerland with his children or if these are old pictures.The caption of Tom Brady’s heartfelt post reads as, “Jack, Benny and Vivi…My forever valentines!”The NFL legend added, “Love you three so much and the awesome adventures we get to share together. From the court to the slopes to everywhere in between, you make all my days brighter! … Loving these Swiss slopes! Just missing you Jack!”As per the U.S. Sun, Tom Brady and 25 year old Alix Earle are “casually” dating even though both of them have stayed away from making any comments about it.Before Tom Brady, Alix Earle was in a pretty serious relationship with popular player, Braxton Berrios, and the two were public about their romance.However, Alix Earle announced their separation in an emotional video in December 2025, just two weeks before she was spotted with Tom Brady at a New Year’s Eve party in St. Barths.","Alix earle makes a cryptic post as tom brady prioritizes his family for valentine’s day.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Virmani's advice to people facing layoffs





An Indian-origin software worker based in Washington has shared how he coped after being laid off from Amazon after more than 10 years, describing how his teenage daughter taught him important lessons in staying strong.47-year-old Hemant Virmani remembered being shocked when he lost his senior software development manager job in October 2025 in a late night email.“Amazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone,” he was quoted as saying according to the Business Insider.Virmani said he had seen colleagues being laid off in 2023 and knew it was tough. Still, getting the notice himself was a shock. He got the tragic news in an email.He said, “There’s no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October of 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.”Virmani credited his teenage daughter for helping him maintain a positive outlook: “My daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery.How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: 'Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.' Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.”Since the layoff, Virmani has focused on learning new skills in artificial intelligence, applying for jobs, and prioritising his health. “I want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future,” he said.He added: “Now I'm building those skills myself. I'm applying for Head of Engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiative(s), averaging 2-3 applications every week.”He thinks that the layoff may be a blessing in disguise. “As of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.”Virmani also offered advice for others facing layoffs: “Realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.”He described the support he received immediately after the layoff: “The morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.”An old manager also reached out to meet him at a coffee shop to check in on his state of mind.","47-year-old hemant virmani lost his senior software development manager job in october 2025 in a late night email.

Dubai Police solve hit-and-run with AI tech

What is “Digital Twin” tech?

Smart policing in the UAE





Dubai has once again stepped into the future of law enforcement. The Dubai Police General Department of Forensic Evidence and Criminology has officially integrated ""Digital Twin"" technology into its investigative toolkit.This cutting-edge system creates a precise, high-definition virtual replica of a physical crime scene. By using advanced 3D scanning and laser mapping, detectives can now move through a digital version of a room or outdoor area with millimeter accuracy.This means the original environment is ""frozen in time,"" allowing investigators to examine every corner of a scene without actually being there physically.In a striking example of 21st-century policing, Dubai Police used its new Digital Twin technology to overturn the initial conclusion in a bridge-fall incident involving a delivery rider. What first appeared to be a suicide quickly became a hit-and-run case after investigators digitally reconstructed the scene.Using highly detailed 3D modelling and virtual reality tools, officers discovered that the rider’s motorcycle had been struck from behind by another vehicle, causing him to fall from the bridge. The fleeing driver left no trace at the scene, but the Digital Twin analysis offered clear visual and scientific evidence to rewrite the narrative and reclassify the case as a crime rather than a tragic self-inflicted act.This wasn’t the only success for the system. Digital Twin also solved a structural collapse investigation involving a basement parking facility. What appeared to be a mysterious failure was revealed through advanced modelling as the result of repeated water leakage that weakened concrete supports over time. By simulating load stresses with scientific precision, police could pinpoint the exact mechanism of collapse.Unlike traditional forensic methods that rely solely on physical evidence and witness statements, Digital Twin builds a virtual replica of a crime scene using cutting-edge technology. This system merges 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics into a unified, interactive digital environment.Investigators can revisit this virtual scene at any time, examine evidence from multiple angles, test hypotheses, and even simulate possible sequences of events, all without returning physically to the location. The models are auditable, transparent and designed to support data-driven decision-making, making them especially valuable in courtrooms where evidence must withstand intense scrutiny.The Digital Twin process unfolds in three stages: first, the scene is digitally documented in full detail; then data is refined and enhanced; finally, advanced analytical tools produce intelligent models and outputs that help investigators understand what really happened.Since its rollout, the Digital Twin system has already clarified nearly 85 incidents, according to Dubai Police project managers. By virtually walking through these scenes, investigators can reduce errors, accelerate analysis time, and provide stronger, more reliable forensic conclusions in the judicial process.The Digital Twin initiative isn’t just innovative, it’s award-winning. The technology received a 7-star rating and was named Best Innovative Project at the International Best Practices Competition (IBPC) 2025, as well as winning the UAE Ideas Award 2025 in Smart Government and Digital Transformation.Senior police engineers highlight that Digital Twin is part of a broader strategy to embed technology and AI into all facets of law enforcement in Dubai. The goal is to make criminal investigations faster, more accurate, and more aligned with modern digital realities.This drive aligns with directives from leadership to position Dubai Police as a global leader in tech-powered law enforcement, a vision backed by investments in AI, virtual reality, and data analytics.","Dubai police use advanced digital twin technology to digitally reconstruct crime scenes.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","Uae partners with starlink to expand global digital education access.
