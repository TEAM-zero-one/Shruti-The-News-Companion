Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

New Delhi: Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom, during the India Energy Week in Goa, presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units — a unique Russian technology for countries like India with long coastlines and developed island territories.Rosatom also presented a comprehensive approach to solving problems in the field of nuclear energy and showed openness to the implementation of joint research projects.Russian company officials at the Goa event paid special attention to possibilities of scientific and technical cooperation based on multipurpose fast research reactor MBIR, which, after commissioning in 2028, will become the most powerful research reactor globally. India has also been invited to join an international consortium based on the reactor and participate in multilateral research programmes.“India is a strategic partner, cooperation with which has been building for many years and is aimed at developing nuclear and related industries. Joint nuclear projects form a solid technological and human foundation, designed for decades to come. The experience of implementing our flagship project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, shows that we do not just work on individual tasks for the facility, but accompany the project throughout its life cycle, contributing to the industrial transformation of India,” Rosatom International Network CEO Egor Kvyatkovsky said.“We see great potential for deepening cooperation in both large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs) construction projects, as well as in non-energy areas such as nuclear medicine, isotope supply, joint research projects, additive technologies and digital solutions,” he said.Rosatom, which has been actively helping India build six 1,000 MW VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, is also discussing new areas of cooperation such as construction of Russian-designed low-power nuclear power plants (ASMMs) in India. ASMM technologies are focused on providing clean electricity to remote areas with limited network infrastructure, as well as energy supply to individual industrial enterprises.ENDSCaption: Rosatom is already helping India set up six nuclear reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu","Russian state-run atomic energy corporation rosatom presented integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors.

New India Q3 profit up 29% to Rs 826 cr; Health segment drives 48% of business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-india-q3-profit-up-29-to-rs-826-cr-health-segment-drives-48-of-business/articleshow/127804430.cms,"Photo credit: X/@NewIndAssurance

MUMBAI: New India Assurance reported a 28.86% rise in net profit to Rs 826 crore for the December quarter, driven by higher investment income and steady growth in premium collections, even as one-time wage-related provisions weighed on underwriting results. Profit before tax rose 61.89% year-on-year to Rs 824 crore in Q3 FY26.Premium income remained firm, with gross written premium increasing 10.47% to Rs 35,555 crore during the quarter. The strongest growth came from the health and personal accident segment, which expanded 16.15% year-on-year to Rs 17,127 crore, reinforcing its position as the company’s largest business line and accounting for 48% of the company’s business. Fire insurance premium grew 15.31% to Rs 5,519 crore. Motor insurance saw a mild contraction, with motor third-party premium down 1.04% and motor own-damage premium lower by 1.34%.Net written premium rose 10.4% to Rs 29,326 crore, while net earned premium increased 9.34% to Rs 28,494 crore. Net incurred claims climbed 11.85% to Rs 28,387 crore, reflecting higher claims across segments. Commission expenses increased 14.18% to Rs 2,883 crore and operating expenses jumped 36.07% to Rs 4,270 crore, largely due to provisions towards wage arrears and retirement benefits.Chairperson Girija Subramanian said domestic gross direct premium growth outpaced the industry average, helping lift the insurer’s market share to 13.4%. She added that global gross written premium for the nine-month period grew 10.5%.“The company recognized provisions of approximately Rs 2,500 Cr toward wage arrears and retirement benefits. While this had a substantial impact on the Combined Operating Ratio, it was partially offset by robust investment income from our equity portfolio. Despite these onetime costs, the company reported stellar Profit Before Tax,”she said.The Rs 1,696 crore for wage arrears and retirement benefits pushed the underwriting loss to Rs 7,046 crore from Rs 4,982 crore a year earlier. The claims ratio for the quarter stood at 99.62%, while the expense ratio rose to 14.56%, taking the combined ratio to 124.01%. Management said the impact was largely due to wage revisions implemented in January, which required total provisions of around Rs 2,500 crore.Investment income provided a cushion, rising 50.99% year-on-year to Rs 8,599 crore, supported by gains from the equity portfolio and favourable market conditions. For the nine months ended December, the company reported profit before tax growth of about 62%.The insurer closed the quarter with a solvency ratio of 1.81 times, well above the regulatory threshold, and said it remained optimistic about sustaining growth momentum amid ongoing reforms and a stable capital position.","New india assurance reported a 28.86% rise in net profit to rs 826 crore for the december quarter.

BENGALURU: A toxic chemical long considered hostile to life on Mars, may not be an obstacle to building on the Red Planet after all. Instead, it could turn out to be an unlikely aid. Researchers at IISc, working with scientists at IISER-Kolkata and Isro astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , have found that perchlorate, a chlorine-based compound known to stress living cells, can strengthen bacteria-made “space bricks” under the right conditions.“Mars is an alien environment. What is going to be the effect of this new alien environment on Earth organisms is a very, very important scientific question to answer,” Aloke Kumar, associate professor, mechanical engineering at IISc and corresponding author, says.Perchlorates have been detected at several Martian landing sites and are considered hostile to life. They interfere with microbial growth and pose health risks to humans. For scientists exploring biological routes to construction on Mars, the compound has long been seen as a constraint that must be eliminated or avoided. The new study, however, points to a more complex interaction between chemistry, biology, and soil.The team focused on bacteria that can bind loose soil into solid blocks through biocementation. In earlier work, IISc researchers showed that the soil bacterium “Sporosarcina pasteurii” can produce calcium carbonate crystals that glue together particles of lunar or Martian soil simulants.The process requires urea, calcium, and guar gum, a natural polymer that supports bacterial survival.In the new study, published in PLOS One, the researchers used a more robust bacterial strain isolated from soils in Bengaluru. After confirming its mineral-forming ability, the team examined how it responded to perchlorate levels comparable to those measured on Mars, reaching up to about one per cent.The biological response was studied in collaboration with IISER-Kolkata, where Professor Punyasloke Bhadury’s group examined how perchlorate alters cell behaviour. The bacteria grew more slowly, became rounder in shape, and began clumping together, all clear signs of chemical stress. They also released higher levels of proteins and other molecules into their surroundings, forming an extracellular matrix.When these stressed bacteria were added to synthetic Martian soil in the lab, the outcome surprised the researchers. With guar gum and a small amount of nickel chloride present, the resulting bricks were stronger than those produced without perchlorate. Microscopy revealed more mineral precipitates and fine “microbridges” formed by the extracellular matrix, linking bacterial cells to soil grains and minerals.“When the effect of perchlorate on just the bacteria is studied in isolation, it is a stressful factor. But in the bricks, with the right ingredients in the mixture, perchlorate is helping,” says IISc’s Swati Dubey, the study’s first author.Ultimately, the team’s goal is to deploy this method as an alternative, sustainable building strategy, to rely less on carbon-intensive cement-based processes – both on Earth and Mars. Co-author of the study, Shukla, who is pursuing his Master’s degree with Kumar at IISc, says such technologies can also help make future Mars landing missions smoother, by helping build better roads, launch pads, and rover landing sites.“The idea is to do in situ resource utilisation as much as possible. We don’t have to carry anything from here; in situ, we can use those resources and make those structures, which will make it a lot easier to navigate and do sustained missions over a period of time,” ,” Shukla added.","Perchlorate, a chlorine-based compound known to stress living cells, can strengthen bacteria-made ‘space bricks’ under the right conditions.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy on Thursday raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and slow down industrial growth.“MSMEs-related reforms need to cut across multiple departments and levels of government — Centre, state, and local bodies,” Murthy said, and added that the effectiveness of reforms depends not only on policy intent, but on the coordination among departments, digital system integration, uniformity in implementation, and citizen and business feedback loops.The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs, statistics and industry representatives from CII, FICCI, Assocham, Phdcci and Fisme on auditor’s ongoing pan-India audit of ease of doing business for MSMEs.“We need a four-pronged strategy of simplification, digitalisation, decriminalisation, and elimination of redundant laws — all of which are highly relevant for MSMEs,” he said. The CAG said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.The meeting was part of the auditor’s consultative process for its pan-India horizontal audit on ease of doing business (EoDB) for MSMEs being undertaken.Murthy further said that while the Centre has embarked on a comprehensive initiative to promote EoDB through systematic compliance reduction and deregulation, the real test of reforms lies in the last-mile outcomes. “The audit seeks to assess whether systems are delivering what they ought to,” he said.Murthy said “the MSME sector is not only critical for economic growth, but also for inclusive development, supporting entrepreneurship, strengthening supply chains, and creating livelihoods across rural and urban India”.The pan-India horizontal audit is outcome-oriented public sector auditing, aligned with national priorities and focused on improving service delivery for MSMEs. It will cover the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26, with field audits. The insights from this audit are expected to support governments in refining reforms, reducing compliance burdens and creating a more predictable, transparent and facilitative business environment, enabling MSMEs to focus on productivity, innovation and growth, according to CAG.eom..","Comptroller and auditor general k sanjay murthy raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) the cag said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127783588,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-152276,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
India–EU FTA: Top winners and losers of the 'mother of all trade deals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indiaeu-fta-top-winners-and-losers-of-the-mother-of-all-trade-deals/articleshow/127641711.cms,"'Biggest In India's History': PM Modi Hails India-EU FTA, Says It Will Reshape Global Economy

What the deal covers

Under the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear.

In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.

Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).

Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.

Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.

However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper.

As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:

Big winners

Apparel & textiles

Leather & footwear

Gems & jewellery

Food products & seafood

Benefits for India

Preferential access across 97% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of trade value.

Immediate duty elimination for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery.

Zero-duty entry for $33 billion worth of exports currently facing EU tariffs of 4–26%.

Sensitive sectors like dairy, cereals and poultry are protected.

Losers

Trade without Trump

Liquor makers

Indian carmakers

Why the deal matters

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (FTA), ending talks that began nearly two decades ago.The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement and is expected to significantly boost exports to the 27-nation EU bloc while reshaping competition for several domestic industries.The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.India gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately.CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Tariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.The EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Indian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.The ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement.Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this.""India has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.The pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Signed after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors.""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner.The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament.","India and the european union announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (fta) the ""mother of all deals"" is india’s 19th trade agreement.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in tripura, odisha and west bengal on account of the birthday of netaji subhas chandra bose, saraswati puja (shree panchami) according to rbi, banks remain closed on second and fourth saturdays of the month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127237109,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1545779,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

From Maruti 800 to a dream garage

1.3 million followers on Instagram





BENGALURU: From keeping accounts for his mother's modest real estate dealings to becoming an honorary consul and one of Bengaluru's wealthiest developers, 57-year-old CJ Roy's journey is a study in foresight and timing.Roy didn't build his fortune by chasing obvious opportunities. Instead, he made his biggest bet on land most others dismissed — tracts along Sarjapur Road that would later transform into Bengaluru's bustling tech corridor.Also read: 'Kept briefcase with pistol close': How CJ Roy’s final hours unfolded at his Bengaluru office Roy's early exposure to real estate came not from boardrooms but from his home. His mother, a neighbourhood real estate agent, quietly bought 30-40 sites at a time, built houses and sold them.Roy was not only tracking the accounts but also silently absorbed the mechanism of land transactions and cash flows. That grounding would later help him make informed decisions that reshaped not just his life, but parts of the city itself.Brought up in central Bengaluru, Roy would remember a city that moved at a gentler pace. BTM Lake was once a spot where fishermen cast their nets, paddy fields lay within city limits, and by 6.30pm the streets would be empty.Watching Bengaluru expand outward left a lasting impression on him: cities, he realised early on, grow towards opportunity, not convenience.His professional life began in 1990 with nine-to-five roles at companies such as BPL, TVS and HP before stepping into realty business. ""I came to business by choice, but entrepreneurship happened by chance,"" he had said in an earlier interview.The defining moment came in 2001. At a time when Bengaluru's real estate players were fixated on central business districts, Roy looked to the outskirts. Sarjapura then was little more than a quiet fringe—open fields, long empty roads and acres selling for about Rs 6 lakh. Most saw it as too remote to matter. Roy saw the geography differently. ""With Whitefield emerging on one side and Electronic City booming on the other, I felt Sarjapura could become the midpoint connecting the city's IT workforce,"" he had said. In 2005, he launched Confident Group.He added: ""I had enough capital to buy 150-200 acres in Sarjapura and I decided to go ahead with it instead of sinking money into the CBD (central business district)."" In fact, when he placed the idea before his family and company directors, the proposal met stiff resistance. Only one person supported it—his wife. Trusting that single vote, Roy walked away from central Bengaluru and committed to building on the periphery.The gamble paid off spectacularly. As Sarjapur Road evolved into Bengaluru's tech zone, land values surged, delivering nearly tenfold returns. Subsequently, he bought lands near Devanahalli (close to Kempegowda International Airport) before expanding his business to Kerala and Dubai.According to him, his first purchase comprised two pieces of land in Kakkanad near Kochi. While 100 flats were designed and much was spent on road shows, there were zero sales there. But a chance encounter in Mumbai with an executive of a Malayalam TV channel led him to offer his flat as the prize to the winner of a reality show. He became the brand ambassador of this show and became the talk of the town. The popularity led to flat sales soon after.Roy's relationship with cars began modestly. In 1994, he bought his first vehicle—a Maruti car. It wasn't just a purchase; it was an emotional milestone. In fact, a salesman, dismissive of his curiosity, had asked him to leave. Roy later recalled that the incident sparked a quiet resolve to one day own the world's most iconic cars. Roy went on to own scores of luxury vehicles, including 12 Rolls-Royce cars, a Bugatti Veyron, a Koenigsegg Agera, Lamborghinis, a McLaren 720S, and a Mercedes-Maybach. Roy had stated that he was paying Rs 18 lakh per Rolls-Royce in insurance premium, and the insurance of all his vehicles put together came up to crores. In a full-circle moment, Roy, who once sold his first car to buy his second, recently repurchased that original Maruti car. To trace it, he even announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for anyone who could help him locate and return the car.Roy had an active Instagram presence with 1.3 million followers even though he had disabled the comment section. His last post was a wish for Republic Day where he said, ‘ A Very Happy Republic Day', with a big smile on his face, wearing a blue blazer. It garnered close to 5 lakh views. He posted actively on his cars and choppers, his travel stories, his time with his family (wife and two kids) and his real estate projects.","Cj roy's early exposure to real estate came not from boardrooms but from his home.

How to apply the quote in daily life

To get more done, learn how to use basic AI tools that are related to your job, like writing assistants, design apps, or data tools.

Use AI to help you with everyday tasks like making notes, scheduling, and doing research so you can spend more time on important and creative work.

Read articles, watch tutorials, or take short online courses to keep your interest in new technologies.

Check your facts and don't rely too much on automated results to learn how to use AI responsibly.

Keep your digital skills up to date so you can stay confident in a work environment that is always changing.

AI can help you save time on things you do every day, like planning trips, keeping track of your money, or learning new things.

Instead of being afraid of technology, tell your friends, coworkers, and family members to learn and grow with it.

Use technology in a way that is in line with human values like honesty, empathy, and critical thinking.

The role of human skills in the age of AI

Things to learn for students and adults

Sam Altman’s other famous quotes

“Hire people who are smarter than you and want to prove it.”

“Risk is not optional—it’s the price of ambition.”

“We need to think long-term if we want to survive as a species.”

“Most startup advice is wrong or only applies in very narrow contexts.”

“If you're not embarrassed by your first product, you launched too late.”

“AI will change everything—and that’s both exciting and terrifying.”

“Multitasking is a myth. Real productivity comes from deep focus.”

“So all you need is a great idea, a great team, a great product, and great execution. So easy! ;)”

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past. A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out.People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam altman's quote tells people to think of ai as a friend, not a foe.

More than 90 percent came from the Kick Creator Incentive Program, not subscriptions or donations. The figures highlight why KCIP has become a major draw for high-visibility streamers seeking higher, view-based payouts.

Clavicular’s Kick dashboard reveal leaves fans stunned by KCIP payout

Katie Porter’s Temper Caught on Camera: Democrat’s FURIOUS Outburst at Staffer Resurfaces





Kick streamer Clavicular has made curiosity to clarity, proving that the Creator Incentive Program on the platform is profitable. Clavicular briefly displayed his earnings dashboard in late January during one of his live streams, and the numbers were soon on the agenda of all streamers. The only difference was not the size of the payout, but the fact that it was concentrated on only one type of income.These figures provided us with an uncommon insight into the consistency and visibility of Kick. Many creators rely on subscriptions and donations to get their money, however, this is not the case with Clavicular. The example of his case indicates that platform-sponsored incentives can transform the business model of a streamer, particularly the creators who receive a significant number of views but are not concentrated on conventional subscriber funnels.Kick paid Clavicular a total of $110,674.67 for most of January 2026. $102,774.60 of that came directly from the Kick Creator Incentive Program, which was more than 90% of his monthly payment. In comparison, chat engagement and subscriptions together brought in about $1,000, which is almost nothing.This breakdown shows why KCIP has become such a popular place for creators to go. Clavicular gets between 60,000 and 100,000 views per stream and has more than 150,000 followers.That visibility directly affects KCIP earnings, rewarding reach instead of paywalled access.The way Kick rewards people has already changed how people stream in general. Famous creators like Zach Asmongold Hoyt have shown in public that Kick payouts are better than those of other platforms. This has led more streamers to multistream or switch platforms altogether.The importance of the Clavicular is exhibited by the fact that Clavicular is the only one working with Kick. Although it has had its issues in the past such as a temporary ban and concerns about his real-life content, the monetary gain is difficult to overlook. His alleged sponsorship with Young LA contributes to his revenue, yet the amounts are unknown.Although the KCIP payouts are able to vary, the January earnings of Clavicular reveal the reason why Kick continues to attract creators who are interested in growing, being stable, and earning a lot of money.","Kick streamer clavicular revealed his january 2026 earnings, showing he made $110,674.67 on kick.

“put on a pedestal”

Pokelawls questions Emiru’s silence amid ongoing controversies

“alarming”





Pokelawls, a Twitch streamer, has reignited the debate among the streaming community by questioning why content creator Emiru has not received any backlash for being silent about the serious controversies surrounding Tectone and Lacari. Pokelawls was heard in one of his recent streams questioning why Emiru is still beingwhen she has previously worked with both of these content creators and has chosen to remain silent about the controversies instead of making a public statement.The situation is rooted in Emiru’s past collaborations with Tectone and Lacari, including podcast appearances and gaming sessions. While both creators have since been surrounded by major controversies, Emiru, an OTK member, has neither unfollowed them on social media nor publicly addressed the issues. Pokelawls suggested that this lack of response has gone largely unquestioned, leading fans and critics alike to debate whether remaining silent in such situations sends an unintended message.Pokelawls specifically pointed to the allegations made against Tectone by his former partner Pinkchyu, which included claims of sexual assault and harassment. These allegations resulted in a protective order and ultimately led to Tectone’s exit from OTK in late 2024. Despite the seriousness of the claims and their impact on the wider community, Emiru has not commented publicly on the situation, something Pokelawls described asgiven her proximity to the people involved.He also highlighted Lacari’s recent bans from Twitch and Kick after a stream incident in which a Notepad file containing links to CSAM was accidentally shown on screen. Lacari initially downplayed the situation before later apologizing and entering treatment. Once again, Emiru chose not to comment or distance herself publicly, which Pokelawls argued stands in contrast to how other creators are often scrutinized for similar silence or associations.Pokelawls’ statements have contributed to a broader online discussion regarding double standards in online streaming culture. While some online viewers share Pokelawls’ opinion on the matter, others disagree and think that content creators are not necessarily required to address issues they are not a part of, even if they have worked with the people involved.Ultimately, the debate brings to light a growing conflict within online communities regarding responsibility, visibility, and the expectations of popular content creators. Although Emiru has yet to respond, Pokelawls’ comments have ensured that the debate regarding silence and accountability is anything but finished.","Pokelawls, a twitch streamer, questioned why content creator emiru has not received any backlash for being silent about the controversies surrounding tectone and lacari.

Nicholas Lee Plumb, a Texas Republican candidate, who announced that he was affected by the latest layoff of Amazon, shared an internal message claiming that it was sent to him by a former colleague, where a discussion about a new engineering team in India was going on. ""We are also forming a new engineering team in India to accelerate product development while supporting operational and data engineering needs,"" the purported message read. The claim, not verified, went viral as many similar claims surfaced that only US employees in certain teams were impacted etc.Amazon announced reductions of 16,000 and called it the organizational changes that started in October. ""The reductions we are making today will impact approximately 16,000 roles across Amazon, and we're again working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted. That starts with offering most US-based employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (timing will vary internationally based on local and country level requirements). Then, for teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll provide transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more,"" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Expertise and Technology at Amazon wrote in her blog.""While we’re making these changes, we’ll also continue hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future. We’re still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there’s significant opportunity ahead,"" Galetti clarified that there is no freeze in hiring.Speaking about his own layoff, Plumb earlier said that it was neither performance not AI that led to the layoffs. ""It’s enabled by a global labor market with almost no guardrails. Companies aren’t just competing on products anymore, they’re arbitraging labor across borders, wages, benefits and worker protections. When replacement is cheaper than retention, the decision gets framed as a strategy instead of consequence,"" he said.""AI becomes the excuse, not the cause. It’s the clean narrative that hides what’s actually happening: experienced workers being swapped out through global labor substitution while leadership talks about “efficiency” and 'the future of work',"" he added.The layoff announcement came weeks after Amazon allowed H-1B workers who got stuck in India because of visa stamping delay to work remotely.","A texas republican candidate, who announced that he was affected by the latest layoff of amazon, shared an internal message claiming that it was sent to him by a former colleague.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis says he is very proud of Apple partnership as iPhone maker ran a very…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-says-he-is-very-proud-of-apple-partnership-as-iphone-maker-ran-a-very/articleshow/127678468.cms,"Apple has chosen Google's Gemini AI for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually. This partnership, confirmed this month, signifies a major shift for Apple, which previously favored in-house development. The revamped Siri, powered by Gemini, is expected with iOS 26.4, aiming for a March/April rollout.

Apple weighed options from OpenAI and Anthropic before settling on Google

Hassabis sees room for the partnership to grow





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis isn't hiding his satisfaction over the Apple deal. In an interview with Alex Heath, Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation. He added that Google has ideas for efficient AI models that could work well on edge devices like phones and even in robotics.The multi-year partnership, confirmed earlier this month, means Apple's foundation models will now be built on Gemini and Google's cloud technology. A joint statement from both companies said Apple found Google's AI to be the most capable option available. The models will still run on Apple devices and its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, keeping the company's privacy commitments intact.According to Bloomberg, Apple is shelling out roughly $1 billion a year for a custom 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model. The company evaluated offerings from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that OpenAI was never really in the running, while Anthropic led early discussions before pricing talks broke down.The Financial Times pegged the deal's total value at around $5 billion for Google, structured as cloud services rather than a straight licensing arrangement. The revamped Siri powered by Gemini is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4, which should hit beta in February before a wider rollout in March or April.Asked about where Google wants to place Gemini versus keeping it exclusive to its own products, Hassabis said it depends on the situation. He noted that Google still has an edge with first-party devices because it can tightly integrate models with product surfaces. But he made clear the company is keen on enterprise business and deeper collaborations with partners that bring strong ecosystems to the table.For Apple, the deal represents a notable departure from its usual playbook of building everything in-house. The company pushed back its major Siri overhaul from spring 2025 to 2026 and moved AI chief John Giannandrea away from product development. The partnership also builds on a long history between the two tech giants—Google already pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones.","Apple has chosen google's gemini ai for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually.
