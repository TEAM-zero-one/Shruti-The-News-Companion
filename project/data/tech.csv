Strahan steps in as a star power guest shark

Can Strahan swim with the Sharks? Corcoran thinks so

Michael Strahan is officially headed to Shark Tank, and the excitement started inside the Tank itself. As news of his guest role broke, longtime investor Barbara Corcoran wasted no time jumping in. Her swift, three-word reaction on Instagram said more than any press release could. It was the kind of instant approval that only a true Shark can give.Within minutes of the announcement, Corcoran left her mark in the comments: “Incredible! Can’t wait (along with a red-heart emoji)” The red heart wasn’t just emoji fluff—it was her signature stamp of excitement. Coming from the show’s sharpest-tongued veteran, it landed like a standing ovation. For a newcomer, few welcomes are more validating than that.Corcoran has spent over a decade dissecting pitches and sizing up personalities. Her enthusiasm for Strahan suggests more than respect—it hints at real expectation. Whether it’s his business acumen or his TV polish, she seems to believe he’s the right fit for the high-stakes heat of the Tank.Before becoming a TV and business powerhouse, Strahan dominated the NFL as a defensive end for the New York Giants.He’s a Super Bowl champion, Hall of Famer, and still holds the single-season sack record. That relentless drive now powers his ventures—from fashion to media. And this fall, it follows him straight into the Tank.Strahan joins a fresh lineup of guest Sharks for Shark Tank Season 17, stepping in after Mark Cuban’s exit. Alongside him, Chip and Joanna Gaines are also confirmed for guest roles this season. But it’s Strahan who’s grabbing the spotlight, with his multi-hyphenate career spanning NFL, network TV, and fashion.ABC’s Instagram post featured the smiling new Shark and read: “This multi-hyphenate is ready to take a seat as a Guest Shark! "" Fans instantly flooded the comments—but Corcoran’s came first. That early nod not only boosted buzz, but also framed Strahan as more than just a celebrity seat-filler.With years of live TV under his belt, Strahan is no stranger to high-pressure moments. But Shark Tank is a different arena—one where instincts matter just as much as strategy. Corcoran’s reaction hints she sees something in him that can thrive in that space.Her short comment might have been casual, but it echoed with authority. “Incredible! Can’t wait” wasn’t just hype—it was an invitation into the inner circle. And with Season 17 approaching, one thing’s certain: Michael Strahan hasn’t even pitched yet, but he’s already won a Shark’s approval. Now all eyes are on how he'll sink or swim when the deals get real.With Corcoran's blessings and the spotlight firmly on him, Strahan's Shark Tank debut already feels like prime-time gold. If first impressions are anything to go by, Strahan's entry might just be the shake-up the Tank didn't know it needed. For fans who've followed his journey from the field to the studio, seeing him in the Tank just feels like the next natural win. And in a show built on guts and grit, Strahan's story might be the most inspiring pitch of all.Also read: Russell Wilson and Ciara’s viral legacy post ignites marvel buzz and signals Giants era","Barbara corcoran gave michael strahan a red-heart welcome to shark tank.

Netflix posts innocent Coldplay clip… at the perfect moment to shade a tech CEO’s rumored affair

Kirk Cousins caught in the crossfire, but fans defend his wholesome reputation

FAQS

1. Why is Kirk Cousins involved in the Astronomer CEO affair scandal?





2. What did Netflix post that sparked the viral reaction?





3. Is Kirk Cousins actually involved in the scandal?

Netflix just proved that even the most wholesome NFL moment isn’t safe from the internet’s ability to twist it into a meme. In a surprisingly savage move, the streaming giant joined in on a viral scandal involving Astronomer CEO Andy Byron—using none other than Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins and his well-known love for Coldplay to stir the pot.A recent Coldplay concert in Boston became the unlikely backdrop for a public firestorm after viral photos suggested Byron was getting a little too cozy with his Chief People Officer, Kristin Cabot. While social media ran wild with affair speculation, Netflix’s official X (formerly Twitter) account jumped into the fray with a perfectly timed screenshot.The clip? A snippet from Season 2 of Quarterback, where Kirk Cousins fondly says, “Coldplay [was] one of the best concerts I've been to.” Harmless on its own—until you pair it with the ongoing viral narrative surrounding Byron and Cabot. Fans instantly recognized the sly dig.“Even Netflix is roasting these two lol,” one user wrote, while another called it “top-tier trolling.” The post was widely interpreted as a stealthy jab, with users praising the Netflix social media team for their chef’s kiss timing.Though Kirk Cousins had nothing to do with the tech affair drama, his name ended up dragged into the narrative simply because of his on-screen Coldplay comment.Some fans rushed to his defense, reminding everyone that Cousins is known for being a “devout Christian and family man” with no history of off-field controversies.Ironically, Cousins has his own real-life drama brewing on the football side. After a tough 2025 NFL season where he posted 18 touchdowns and a career-worst 16 interceptions, he was benched for rookie Michael Penix Jr. Now facing a potential QB battle in Atlanta, Cousins surely didn’t expect his biggest off-season headline to involve Coldplay and a corporate scandal.Still, thanks to Netflix’s sly post and the power of internet timing, Cousins is once again trending—this time not for his throws, but for a viral Coldplay concert that had nothing to do with him, yet somehow made him the star.Also Read: Netflix fan-favorite Jenna Waller makes the cut as Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders announces 2025 rookie cheerleaders Kirk Cousins was unintentionally dragged in due to a Netflix post referencing his love for Coldplay amid the CEO's viral affair rumors.Netflix shared a clip of Cousins praising Coldplay, timed to coincide with affair allegations involving Astronomer CEO Andy Byron at a Coldplay concert.No, Kirk Cousins had no involvement in the scandal.",Netflix wittily entered a viral scandal involving astronomer ceo andy byron by using a clip from 'quarterback' featuring kirk cousins.

Here's everything going down in the aftermath of the most controversial mirror selfie of the season.The photo, now viral, shows Ja’Marr Chase cozying up with his girlfriend in front of an ornate wooden mirror. She’s holding the phone, he’s holding her waist (hand notably…low), and the whole vibe screams “we’re good, we look good, life’s good.”It was clearly meant to be intimate and casual but NFL Twitter took it personally. Within hours, the post racked up hundreds of thousands of views, TikTok reposts, and a storm of “what is he doing” replies.The energy? Equal parts “king behavior” and “delete this now, Ja’Marr.”As always, the internet overdelivered.It’s like every corner of Twitter showed up, NFL fans, gossip trolls, incels, and bored uncles.

But when NFL stars post their love lives, the internet reacts like it’s the Super Bowl.The comments reveal something deeper: how athletes’ relationships get projected onto by fans.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

Grace Springer, the woman who posted the viral video of former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and HR chief Kristin Cabot from the Coldplay concert in Boston, busted a myth that people are thinking about her -- that she is minting millions as the video has gone viral.Springer said she made no money from the viral video or for the views and it's not monetized.“I was hoping to see myself on the big screen, and I love to capture moments, so that’s why my phone was out in the first place. In the moment when I filmed it, I didn’t think much of it, but of course, everyone was kind of chattering. There was over 50,000 people at the concert, so it was a hot topic,” Grace said.Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot were in each other's embrace when they got featured on the jumbotron at the concert. When they saw themselves on the screen, they quickly ducked and it would have been buried had the video of the exact moment been not captured by Springer and posted it on her TikTok. The video went viral in no time after keen eyes of social media users found out that the man was a big-time CEO of a major tech company and the woman was not his wife, but the company HR.Springer said part of her felt bad for the repurcussion that happened but she believes others too had the video and anyone could have posted it. “I definitely feel for Andy’s wife Megan, his family and everyone else who has been hurt in the process,” she said. “But as I said, there was over 50,000 people and I’m not the only one that caught it on camera, so if it wasn’t me who uploaded it, I’m sure someone else would have.”After Astronomer announced investigation into the incident, Andy Byron resigned from the post.
