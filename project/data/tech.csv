India's growing role as a hub for energy GCCs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-growing-role-as-a-hub-for-energy-gccs/articleshow/120212766.cms,"India has emerged as a preferred destination for energy GCCs , which are setting up tech centres focused on renewable energy , with significant offshoring opportunities across upstream, midstream, and downstream. GCCs are instrumental in facilitating this transformation, expanding their scope of work in energy solutions, grid modernisation, and clean energy technologies.EY’s data showed India has 77 GCCs in the energy sector, spanning areas such as oil and gas, power and utilities, renewable energy, and mining. These GCCs collectively employ around 50,000 people. EY analysis reveals there are over 24,000 professionals employed in energy-focused GCCs in India, with talent concentrated in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, and Chennai.With global renewable capacity expected to grow 2.7 times by 2030 compared to 2024, these firms are increasingly investing in renewable energy sources, recognising the need to transition towards more sustainable energy solutions to meet both regulatory pressures and consumer expectations. “GCCs leverage the large talent pool in engineering, R&D, and laboratory functions across their portfolios, integral to India’s energy GCC growth. Key activities include 2D/3D digital engineering, brownfield/green engineering, turnaround management, geophysics operations, and petrophysical studies. Earlier, global parent organisations focused on energy centres of excellence (CoEs) in asset management and regulatory affairs. However, the focus has now shifted towards decarbonisation , clean energy transition, and fuel logistics to align with the ever-evolving energy landscape,” wrote Arindam Sen, EY India Global Business Services and operations partner, and Kunal Ghatak, partner for Global Business Services in EY India.“What is fascinating to see, however, is that these companies, to a large degree, are somewhat laggards as far as the GCC world is concerned. All of them have a significant cost reduction exercise in some form. There was a significant evolution in job roles within the sector. A recent development in the past two years was the introduction of petrotech and petroleum engineering roles in India, marking a departure from previous practices. This represents both a broadening of portfolio and a fresh assessment of India's potential to deliver diverse skill sets beyond conventional offerings. The companies are pursuing these changes whilst managing their cost considerations and operational pressures,” Sen told TOI.Shell, for instance, has over 13,000 employees in India, with a presence in integrated gas, downstream, power, renewables, and upstream, with capabilities in R&D and digitalisation. Last year, American energy giant Chevron said it was investing $1 billion in a new engineering and technology centre in Bengaluru. The investment will be spread over 5-6 years, with the company aiming to hire 600 employees across disciplines like mechanical, civil, petroleum, and computer science by the end of 2025. BP has over 2,300 employees in India, including engineering talent at the Technical Solutions India (TSI) centre in Pune. TSI is leveraging its engineering capabilities to deliver services to BP's hydrocarbons and new energy operations globally.Bengaluru, EY’s report said, is becoming a hub for professionals skilled in turbine micro-siting, GIS mapping, and aerodynamic modelling—expertise vital for advancing wind energy infrastructure. It also said the hydrogen energy sector is gaining momentum, with key talent clusters in Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Chennai. These cities are home to professionals specialising in hydrogen blending, storage solutions, and refinery operations, all critical to supporting India’s transition to green hydrogen solutions. Sen, however, said companies are struggling to recruit qualified experts capable of handling the transition to cleaner energy sources and decarbonisation initiatives. The scarcity of such specialised talent is evident in Europe and across the US.","India has 77 gccs in the energy sector, spanning areas such as oil and gas, power and utilities, renewable energy, and mining. Ey analysis reveals there are over 24,000 professionals employed in energy-focused gccs. Talent concentrated in bengaluru, mumbai, pune, delhi ncr, hyderabad, and chennai.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120212774,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17818,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift.

It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety.

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Poll Is it ethical for tech companies to collaborate with military organizations? No, it promotes violence. Yes, it's part of national defense.

A former Microsoft employee ignited controversy during the company’s 50th anniversary celebration, confronting top executives including CEO Satya Nadella and former heads Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. The employee, Vaniya Agrawal, an Indian-American software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in Gaza through its technologies.“Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood,” she declared before being escorted out of the event. Neither Gates nor Nadella nor Ballmer responded to the outburst, choosing instead to continue their panel discussion.Agrawal, who has since resigned from the company, described Microsoft as a “digital weapons manufacturer” and condemned its alleged collaboration with the Israeli military. In a pointed critique, she called on Microsoft to end its ties with Israel, highlighting what she claimed was a $133 million agreement with Israel’s Ministry of Defense involving AI and Azure tools.In her resignation letter, Agrawal wrote, “I cannot, in good conscience, be part of a company that participates in this violent injustice,” and added, “If you must continue to work at Microsoft, I urge you to use your position, power, and privilege to hold Microsoft accountable to its own values and mission.”This isn’t the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company's partnerships. Earlier, Ibtihal Aboussad, another staffer who also resigned, disrupted a session led by Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO. She called him a “war profiteer,” accusing him and the company of enabling violence. “Microsoft technologies are being used to commit acts of genocide,” she alleged. Suleyman responded, “Thank you for your protest. I hear you.”Back in February, Nadella faced similar internal dissent when five employees were removed from a meeting after protesting Microsoft’s contracts with Israeli defense entities. The backlash has intensified in recent months as violence surged in Gaza following the breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.","Vaniya agrawal, an indian-american software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in gaza through its technologies.

Pumping up production

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards. According to a recent GTRI report, India's electronics component imports in FY24 increased by 36.7% to $34.4 billion compared to the previous year. Over five years, imports grew by 118.2% from $15.8 billion in FY19.Also Read | Apple looks to manufacture more iPhones in India as Trump’s tariffs hit China harder: Report Chinese manufacturers are experiencing surplus issues, according to Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of television contract manufacturer Super Plastronics.""There is panic.

""However, since domestic demand in India is not robust, companies may pass some as discounts."" In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday.

RBI proposes new route for offloading bad loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-route-for-offloading-bad-loans/articleshow/120217704.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has proposed a new route for banks and NBFCs to offload bad loans, allowing them to bundle and sell stressed assets directly to investors through special purpose entities set up by regulated financial firms. Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets. The move, announced with the April monetary policy, is intended to broaden the market for distressed debt and reduce dependence on ARCs.A key feature is the appointment of resolution managers, tasked with recovering value from the underlying assets. These must be independent of the originating lender. For such loans, RBI-regulated entities can act as resolution managers. For others, insolvency professionals and regulated institutions may qualify. Lenders must gradually provision for the securitised notes over five years. Capital requirements vary with recovery ratings, favoring senior tranches. Any exposure left after five years is to be marked down to Re 1.With the new dispensation, ARCs may lose some of their market. Larger cases are presently going to the NARCL, and the new framework will now allow lenders to bypass ARCs for mid-sized and retail loans. RBI has also mandated that ARCs must raise their net owned fund to Rs 300 crore by FY26, a threshold many have yet to meet. The new framework retains a key principle of RBI's regulations on bad loans that are aimed at preventing defaulters getting control of their assets through the back door.","Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets.

Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey

TOI’s Surojit Gupta & Sidhartha, Pandey

What are your priority areas?

In a sense, you are promoting ease of doing business?

Markets are very volatile now. How do you assure the investor community that Indian markets are safe?

Have you increased surveillance in

the market, amid what’s happening around the globe?

What is the state of play on IPOs? Do you see some slowing down because of the volatility?

What is the progress on a common KYC across the financial sector?

What is the position on allowing foreign individuals to invest directly in Indian stock markets?

What is your view on overseas listing of Indian companies?

Does Sebi need to do more on communication with the market?

There is also a lot of misinformation. Are you planning a fact check?

Are you looking at promoting new kinds of futures such as energy futures? Agricultural futures have been a no-go area. Will you review that?

India has moved forward and

introduced a T+0 for a select number of stocks. What is the roadmap?

How much of a challenge do you think the new technology, such AI, is for capital markets?

One of the irritants for people is the IEPF (Investor Education and Protection Fund) guidelines. There are a lot of complaints that people are not able to get their genuine claims settled…

What are the other measures that the regulator is contemplating to make the market more secure for a new retrail investor?

is a little over a month into his job and has undertaken several measures to ensure more trust in the stock market regulator. In an interview totalks about a range of issues and assures investors that the Indian markets are safe against the backdrop of volatility triggered by global events. Excerpts...We have got three mandates, which are investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets. Four elements that we will bring in are trust, transparency, technology and teamwork. On trust, it will be people’s trust in Sebi and Sebi’s trust of its ecosystem, both need to be promoted. Conflict of interest norms also need to be updated, for which we have set up a committee and that will give us a lot of guidance on how we put our framework. Another issue on trust is how we are going to make our regulations.Regulations should be optimum, which are risk-based. If you have a higher amount of risk, there should be a higher scrutiny, if there is low amount of risk or something which need not be micromanaged, in that case, we should not get into that.So that balancing is required. We also need to look at some of the past regulations. Whether in a particular context they may have been necessary, but now context may have changed, or technology has worked out, or the system has improved and therefore that kind of micromanagement may not be contextually necessary. In that case, we should eliminate them. Every department is being asked to look at their regulations and work with stakeholders to identify what are the points that can be simplified.Yes, ease of doing business combined with ensuring that market integrity is maintained at all times, and investors are duly protected. With the development of the market, there are new products, the Indian capital market is growing rapidly. It has to have all elements. It has to have different types of risks. There are different diversifications, which are already there. There are different possibilities in the futures market, such as energy futures.Our payment and settlement systems are very robust. The possibil ity of any default is not there. The contracts will be honoured. People can enter and exit without difficulty. When we are interacting with other market participants, FIIs and other investors, they have a lot of trust in our institutions, in our ability to handle. Indian systems are some of the most modern in the world, most secure in the world. From 2019 to 2024, the CAGR in India was 8.5% in dollar terms. In this period it was zero for emerging market and minus 3% for China.From the 1990s, when FIIs were allowed, the markets have consistently given double-digit returns in dollar terms. These markets have developed over a period of time. We are estimating 6.5% GDP growth and the fundamentals are strong. The budget has offered incentives, which will boost domestic consumption and RBI ’s policy has been supportive and accommodative. Headwinds are there, no doubt. But India may offer some opportunities too, relatively speaking.We are always on 24x7 surveillance. Sebi in coordination with exchanges is constantly watching the situation. And, we had, even the worst days when you had a sharp fall, we did have an impact. Relative to the rest of the world, India was much less affected.There were some concerns around some of the small IPOs seeing massive subscriptions.On the SME IPO issue, there have been changes by Sebi and certain regulatory measures have been brought in. On the main board, IPOs have gone up. India had the largest number of IPOs. In contrast, there are markets where IPOs have not been possible for the whole year.There is good progress there. Both Sebi and RBI have to work together and there are certain points that need to be ironed out, which we should be able to do soon.There is some discussion happening. The department of economic affairs is undertaking a review of Fema rules. One of them relates to NRIs and there is a limit of 5% that they are thinking of raising it to 10% and the overall to 24%. Then, there is the idea that investors could be directly asked to do that. But we still have to examine and deliberate. There is discussion on how the KYC will be done, what the implications will be and so on. Right now, individuals can come, but they have to come through FIIs or through a fund.On the contrary, there are a lot of companies that want to list in India and we should welcome that. We will facilitate it. We are here to develop our capital market. Reverse flipping is taking place.We have been communicating. We put a lot of things on the website and Sebi has very good practices. We must appreciate that they have been developed over a period of time and successive leadership in Sebi has honed up this place, they have nurtured it. The institution has come up, faced many challenges and also improved. Obviously, we have to constantly be on the move because no complacency is acceptable. One piece which was missing, we didn’t have a very active social media presence and we have recently unveiled it.We immediately get into areas where some false online platform is there and there are attempts to swindle the money in the name of investment, including through cyber frauds. Then, there is also the issue of fin-fluencers. We have taken down something like 70,000 fin-fluencers from YouTube with the help of Meta and Google. At the same time, we also want more of the industry to develop and have registered entities.We will be making progress around that (energy futures) because a lot of things have been developed and a lot of regulatory hurdles have been crossed. Soon you should be seeing that. About agriculture, some of the important products are not available. That is something which is hampering the industry. But that’s a policy call, which has to be taken by govt.If you ask me, T+1 is good enough.AI has to be looked at from both sides. It has enormous potential. For example, Sebi itself uses a lot of AI tools and going forward, we would like to use this in all areas of our work. But AI also has certain other points, which are risks. So, we also need to evolve a risk mitigation strategy.Proactive efforts should be made so that it doesn’t have to go to IEPF. Sebi will really explore. We will facilitate use of registered transfer agents by IEPF for processing. We will help them to process any claim. Then in next two months we will conduct Niveshak Shivirs in Mumbai and Gujarat jointly with ministry of corporate affairs, where we will get top corporate RTAs where we have a large IEPF outstanding. They have ledgers and the companies are making efforts.We need to increase investor awareness. People coming to the stock market is a welcome thing. After all, you have to deploy your savings. The most important thing is that people should not be borrowing to invest. This is an issue where sometimes you do learn by some sagacious advice from your friends and relatives. Sometimes, you get lured into some riskier ventures on the advice of some of your sagacious peers. Then sometimes you lose money.The point is that it’s like a behavioural issue. And in behaviour, you can have an awareness element. We would like to up that awareness element. Mutual fund industry is doing its own awareness drives. So, everybody doesn’t get into very risky things. Because some of the people can get attracted to very abnormal gains, which some listed companies might show. On the awareness part, we would like to upscale our efforts more together as an ecosystem. Ideally, we should also collaborate with other regulators and work together for financial awareness of a higher order.","Will bring in four elements of trust, transparency, technology and teamwork under triple mandate of investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets.

Aiming for a renaissance

Turning the tables on France

NEW DELHI: Italian powerhouse Prada announced Thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival Versace from US-based Capri Holdings in a €1.25 billion (over Rs 12,000 crore) deal, a move poised to reshape the balance of power in high fashion.The deal, set to close in the second half of 2025, creates an Italian luxury giant with revenues exceeding €6 billion — a bold challenge to French behemoths like LVMH and Kering, amid a global slowdown in luxury spending.“We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group,” said Patrizio Bertelli, Prada’s executive director and long-time helmsperson of the brand. “We share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship, and heritage.”The acquisition comes at a discount. Capri Holdings, which acquired Versace for €1.83 billion in 2018, had to accept a reduced offer from Prada due to weakened sales and Trump-era tariffs that dented valuations.Adding to the intrigue, Donatella Versace — who took over the house after the tragic murder of her brother Gianni in 1997 — stepped down as creative director on April 1, paving the way for the deal.Donatella, now 69, will serve as the label’s chief brand ambassador.Her replacement, Dario Vitale, is the force behind the rise of Prada’s edgy younger sibling, Miu Miu — signaling a potential pivot for Versace from glitz to Gen Z.The merger brings together two distinct worlds: Versace’s opulent, baroque aesthetic and Prada’s cerebral minimalism. Prada insists it won’t erase Versace’s DNA but will instead enhance it with “industrial capabilities and operational expertise.”Yet analysts warn of a delicate balancing act.“This is a risky move,” said Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Bernstein. “Prada may become distracted from its core business, as happened with earlier acquisitions like Jil Sander and Helmut Lang.”Versace’s third-quarter revenue in fiscal 2025 fell 15 percent to $193 million, a far cry from Prada’s soaring performance. Under the guidance of creative director Miuccia Prada and CEO Andrea Guerra, Prada posted a 25 percent jump in net profit in 2024, reaching €839 million, with revenue climbing to €5.4 billion.Guerra acknowledged the task ahead: “The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution. Versace has huge potential — but evolution takes time.”The acquisition is more than a financial move — it’s a statement of intent. In recent years, French conglomerates have scooped up Italy’s brightest stars: Gucci, Fendi, Bottega Veneta. With this deal, Prada flips the script.“Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life,” said design consultant Antonio Bandini Conti.W hether the strategy pays off remains to be seen. But in a world where fashion loves a comeback, Prada is betting that Versace’s next chapter — wrapped in minimalist luxury and turbocharged by Milanese precision — could be its boldest yet.","Italian powerhouse prada announced thursday it will acquire flamboyant rival versace from us-based capri holdings in a €1.25 billion deal.

For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of co2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
