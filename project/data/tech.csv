BENGALURU: Photonics and defence technology firm olee.space Friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system capable of transmitting data at 10Gbps over a distance of 20km.The system, built with about 85% locally sourced components, was designed, manufactured and tested in India. The company said the demonstration validated its ability to deliver long-range, high-capacity optical wireless links suitable for defence and other strategic applications under representative atmospheric conditions.Wireless laser communication offers advantages such as independence from radio-frequency spectrum, low probability of interception and resistance to electronic jamming, making it relevant for defence and government use where conventional RF systems face limitations.According to olee.space , the platform integrates precision opto-mechanical subsystems developed in-house, including a high-accuracy, Indian-manufactured gimbal with arc-second level pointing precision.It also features an internally integrated fast steering mirror assembly. “Together, the dual-stage stabilisation system uses voice-coil and piezo-mounted actuators [mechanisms that convert electrical energy into motion] to maintain link stability over long distances, even under dynamic atmospheric or platform-induced disturbances,” the firm said. olee.space founder and CEO James Solomon said the achievement marked a significant milestone for indigenous optical communication capabilities.“Achieving a 20km, 10 Gbps optical link with carrier-grade availability under Indian operating conditions establishes India’s ability to design, manufacture and validate advanced wireless laser communication systems using predominantly indigenous technologies,” he said.During performance validation, the system achieved a carrier-grade link availability of over 99.9%, meeting operational requirements for mission-critical communication.The company said the entire design, integration and field demonstration were completed within four months of project funding. This, it noted, reflected the growing maturity of India’s private-sector defence manufacturing ecosystem and its capacity to deliver advanced optical communication systems at speed.The system’s architecture is designed to be adaptable across terrestrial, maritime, aerial and high-altitude platforms, with potential for future space-based applications, subject to integration requirements. By reducing reliance on imported optical communication subsystems, the capability supports India’s push towards end-to-end indigenous development in advanced wireless communication technologies.","Photonics and defence technology firm olee.space friday said it has successfully demonstrated an indigenous wireless laser communication system.

Mathematics with real-world impact



Securing the quantum future

Indian-origin mathematician Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year, becoming the first mathematician to receive the state’s top science honour in Australia. The recognition highlights her pioneering work in applied mathematics and its growing importance in addressing complex scientific and technological challenges, from climate modelling to secure digital communications.The award places a spotlight on the often unseen role mathematics plays in modern life, with Joshi’s research helping to shape advances in fields such as fibre-optic technology, nonlinear physics and emerging quantum systems.Nalini Joshi is a world-leading applied mathematician and a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Sydney, where she currently serves as Chair of Applied Mathematics. She made history as the first woman appointed Professor of Mathematics at the university, a milestone widely seen as a breakthrough for gender representation in Australian academia.Her research is internationally recognised in the field of integrable systems, a branch of mathematics that studies complex nonlinear equations.These equations are essential for describing real-world phenomena that do not behave in simple or predictable ways, including fluid flows, wave motion and optical systems.Although rooted in theory, Joshi’s work has had wide practical influence. Integrable systems play a crucial role in fibre-optic communications, which form the backbone of the internet and global data networks, as well as in climate science, where advanced mathematical models help scientists understand highly sensitive and chaotic environmental systems.Colleagues often note that her research demonstrates how abstract mathematics can drive innovation across disciplines, even when its contributions remain largely invisible to the public.In recent years, Joshi has increasingly focused on the implications of quantum computing, particularly in the area of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of keeping information secure so that only authorised people can access it. It is what protects online banking, digital payments, emails, messaging apps and government systems by scrambling data into coded forms that are extremely difficult to break.While quantum computers promise major advances in areas such as drug discovery and materials science, they also pose a serious risk to today’s cryptographic systems. Powerful quantum machines could potentially crack many of the encryption methods currently used to protect financial systems and digital infrastructure.Joshi has warned that governments and industries are not sufficiently prepared for this shift. She has highlighted Australia’s limited number of specialists capable of developing post-quantum cryptography, new encryption techniques designed to withstand quantum attacks, and has argued that long-term investment in advanced mathematics is essential.“Mathematics is central to securing our quantum future,” she has said.The New South Wales Scientist of the Year award also acknowledges Joshi’s broader contributions as a leader, mentor and advocate for science. She has been a strong voice for strengthening mathematical education and research capacity, and for recognising mathematics as a foundational discipline that enables progress across science and technology.",Nalini joshi has been named new south wales’ scientist of the year.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

He argues current models are commoditized and true value lies in securely accessing and reasoning over sensitive company information. Oracle is investing heavily, leveraging its vast database presence to become the enterprise AI backbone, facing competition from cloud rivals.

Oracle bets big on becoming the enterprise AI backbone

The race for private data access heats up





Oracle founder and CTO Larry Ellison has identified what he calls the critical limitation holding back AI models from Gemini to ChatGPT: they're all trained on the same publicly available internet data, making them increasingly commoditized with little real differentiation between them.Speaking during Oracle's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call in December, Ellison argued that while training foundational models on public data has created ""the largest and fastest-growing business in human history,"" the real value lies ahead in a second phase: enabling these models to securely reason over private enterprise data without compromising security.""For these models to reach their peak value, you need to train them not just on publicly available data, but make privately owned data available for those models as well,"" Ellison said. He estimates this next phase will prove ""even larger and more valuable"" than the current GPU and data center boom.Oracle is positioning itself as uniquely equipped for this shift. The company points out that most of the world's high-value private data already lives in Oracle databases. Its AI Data Platform uses techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation to let any major AI model query private data in real-time while maintaining security.The company is backing this vision with aggressive spending, projecting roughly $50 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $35 billion estimated in September. At Oracle AI World in October, the company announced partnerships including a 50,000-GPU AI supercluster with AMD MI450 chips launching in Q3 2026, and the OCI Zettascale10 supercomputer connecting hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs.Ellison's thesis faces challenges from multiple angles. Synthetic data generation could reduce dependence on exclusive proprietary data sets; real-time user interaction data from consumer apps could turn out to be more valuable than static enterprise records. At the same time, rivals like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are racing to develop comparable enterprise AI capabilities, though Oracle argues its established grip on enterprise databases gives it a strategic advantage. By late 2025, the company's cloud backlog had topped $500 billion, driven mostly by demand for AI.","Oracle's larry ellison believes ai's next frontier is private enterprise data.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s alpamayo to debut with mercedes cla later this year.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

The breakthrough, Vembu disclosed on X, came after the engineer discovered Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 model, which he called a ""game changer"" that finally convinced him AI-generated code was worth using.""I did not know he was building it. I was blown away by the depth and breadth of the tool,"" Vembu wrote, describing how the experienced developer from his R&D team created the project in his spare time. The Zoho founder characterized the moment as the arrival of ""powerful machine looms for software development,"" comparing the disruption to how mechanized weaving once challenged traditional handloom workers.The productivity gains extend across Zoho's engineering organization. Vembu shared that one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience handling performance-critical UI work—is now completing in a single day what previously took three weeks. ""AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience,"" Vembu explained.The Indian SaaS giant has rolled out AI coding tools company-wide but with strict guardrails. Engineers must review and approve all AI-generated code and take full responsibility for it, Vembu emphasized. Zoho doesn't mandate AI usage, instead leaving implementation decisions to experienced developers who can assess when the technology adds value.Even junior developers are seeing breakthroughs. Vembu noted that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI assistance that's now being used across multiple teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. For UI development specifically, Vembu's team is ""very bullish on AI.""""As Chief Scientist, I am under pressure,"" Vembu admitted, acknowledging the technology's transformative impact. ""Wish us luck.""",Zoho chief scientist sridhar vembu revealed an engineer built a complex security tool in a month using ai. Another senior engineer now completes three-week projects in a day.

Nvidia has unveiled its next-generation AI computing platform, called Vera Rubin, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas. The announcement was made by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who said the new platform is now in full production. Rubin is designed to support large-scale artificial intelligence workloads and is aimed at data centres, cloud providers and enterprises building advanced AI systems. Nvidia said the platform is built to lower the cost of AI computing and support faster training and deployment of AI models. Rubin succeeds Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture and is part of the company’s broader push to expand AI use across industries.Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks. Nvidia said the platform is built to support large-scale AI training and inference more efficiently.According to Nvidia, the Rubin platform can reduce the cost of generating AI tokens to about one-tenth of previous platforms. The company also introduced an AI-focused storage system called Inference Context Memory Storage, which is designed to improve long-context AI processing by increasing speed and efficiency.Nvidia said the Rubin platform will be used alongside its open AI models and software tools to support applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, healthcare and climate research.The announcement was shared by an X user Sawyer Merritt who also shared a video of the chip maker’s next-generation Rubin chips. Responding to the post, Musk said “It will take another 9 months or so before the hardware is operational at scale and the software works well”, highlighting deployment realities beyond raw power claims.","Vera rubin is nvidia’s first six-chip ai platform developed using an ‘extreme codesign’ approach, where multiple components are designed together.

Asmongold and Hasan Piker dispute grows after Twitch analytics stream and X exchanges







Zack Hoyt, known online as Asmongold, found himself at the center of new viewbotting talk this week. The issue started during a live Twitch stream on January 9, 2026. Another popular streamer, Hasan Piker, also known as HasanAbi, reacted after Asmongold opened analytics pages on stream. The moment quickly spread across Twitch and social media. Viewbotting means fake viewers or followers are added to a channel. It is a serious claim because it questions how real a creator’s audience is.Both streamers denied doing anything wrong. They also said third parties can send fake followers without permission. What made this story bigger was how both creators accused each other of hypocrisy. The discussion did not stay on Twitch. It moved to X, where screenshots, numbers, and old claims were shared. Here is a clear and simple look at what happened, why it matters, and what each side said.During his January 9 stream, Zack Hoyt opened Hasan Piker’s public analytics on TwitchTracker. While looking at the follower graph, Asmongold said, “I will see if he is doing it today or not.” The chart showed a fast rise in followers soon after Hasan started streaming.Asmongold reacted with confusion and sarcasm, saying, “What is this show? I am confused by what I am seeing.”Hasan Piker replied on his own stream and said the growth was not his doing. He explained that fake followers often get added without warning. Hasan said, “I get follower botted often. That is something I cannot control.”Right after that, Asmongold made his position clear. He said he was not blaming Hasan for the spike. He explained that outside groups can cause these jumps. However, he also said it felt unfair to be accused often. Asmongold said, “I am not holding Hasan responsible. But it feels wrong to accuse me again when this also happens to his channel.”Later, Hasan questioned Asmongold’s numbers. He compared subscriber counts, viewers, and chat activity. Hasan said, “He has around 7,000 subscribers with about 61,000 viewers. I have more subscribers with fewer viewers. You can also look at active chatters.”The argument then moved to X. Hasan claimed that after Twitch removed bots in August 2025, Asmongold’s views dropped. For context, Twitch did confirm a large bot cleanup last year, which affected many channels.Asmongold replied by sharing his own TwitchTracker data. He said the claims were wrong and posted, “This information is false.” Hasan answered again, saying Asmongold’s numbers still looked unusual. Asmongold ended the exchange by posting a photo of a smiling seal.Around the same time, several streamers said their channels were affected by bot activity, showing this problem is not limited to one creator.Also Read: Twitch Streamer Zack “Asmongold” Sparks Backlash After Defending ICE Officer In Minneapolis Shooting Incident, Elon Musk Reacts",Twitch viewbotting controversy grows as asmongold and hasan piker trade claims using live stream analytics numbers online.

Brendan Kane's tip on power of strategy over hype



Hook Point

One Million Followers

The Guide to Going Viral





At the world’s largest content economy gathering, Dubai's 1 Billion Followers Summit, global social media strategist Brendan Kane delivered a reality check for creators who are tired of chasing fleeting virality and illusions. The bestselling author took the stage at the Billion Followers Summit and asserted one clear message that most myths in digital growth are not just wrong, they actively prevent success.The summit, hosted by the UAE Government Media Office across iconic venues like Emirates Towers, Dubai International Financial Centre and the Museum of the Future, has drawn 30,000 attendees, including over 15,000 creators, hundreds of global influencers, 150 CEOs and 500+ speakers. It is a centre of gravity for the creator economy but Kane’s session, provocatively titled “The Biggest Five Lies on Social Media and How They Hinder Your Progress”, quickly became one of the most talked-about highlights of the event.In an era where overnight sensation stories dominate headlines, Kane pushed back against the idea that going viral is magic or fortune. “Rapid success isn’t random, it’s rooted in impactful storytelling and long-term audience relationships,” he stated, dismantling the misconception that luck is the secret sauce.True engagement, he said, comes from understanding why people watch, share and return and not merely how many do.This sentiment echoes a broader shift in the digital world. Audiences crave connection, not just content and creators who build that bridge intentionally tend to see repeat engagement and sustained growth over time.A favourite meme in content circles is the idea that only polished, high-budget productions succeed. Kane tore that myth down with a striking comparison: a simple TikTok video that reached 17 million views outperformed a highly professional ad that drew only 3,500 views.His point was that authenticity trumps polish and spontaneity often connects more deeply than glossy production. In a world where audiences reward realness over perfection, creators don’t need blockbuster budgets to make blockbuster impact.Creators often delay publishing because they believe their subject is too dry, be it on insurance, technical services or even health tips. Kane showcased examples of videos on traditionally “unsexy” topics that exploded because they were presented in engaging formats with clear, relatable messaging.His takeaway was that format and clarity matter far more than subject prestige. Whether it is car insurance or climate science, any topic can resonate if communicated creatively and with purpose.One of the most persistent pieces of creator advice is to post constantly. Kane argued that posting strategy matters far more than posting frequency. A steady stream of mediocre content doesn’t build communities, it fatigues audiences.Instead, he urged creators to think like storytellers: every piece of content should have intent, a clear message and strong audience appeal. Quality content creates impact; quantity alone does not.Many aspiring creators stall because they feel they lack experience. Kane firmly disputed this: with the right tools, systems and strategic mindset, beginners can compete with seasoned professionals. Modern content ecosystems, from mobile editing tools to analytic dashboards, level the playing field more than ever before.His message was clear: accessibility and creativity can outperform pedigree if approached strategically.Cain didn’t just debunk myths, he redefined success for a new generation of digital storytellers. He urged creators to focus on:“Social media is not just a platform, it is a revolution in the world of communication. For the first time in history, anyone with a compelling story can reach audiences,” Kane said, noting that more than 5.2 billion people worldwide now use social media. He added that true reach is not driven by paid ads but by deep engagement and interaction, a combination of storytelling and audience retention that fosters loyalty.“Don’t fight the algorithms, cooperate with them,” he quipped, highlighting how creators can increase their visibility by understanding platform behaviour rather than resisting it.Kane’s own books includingandoffer practical strategies that help creators avoid wasted effort and build momentum toward measurable results. His session at the summit translated many of those lessons into actionable insights for beginners and pros alike.The Billion Followers Summit is not just about gathering influencers under one roof, it is about shaping the future of the creator economy. With hundreds of sessions, workshops and dialogues on everything from monetisation and AI in content creation to ethical digital practices, the event reflects a maturing ecosystem that values purpose over fad.Industry observers say that this year’s summit signals a shift from quantity to quality, from chasing metrics to building meaning. Cain’s session crystallised that shift, positioning impact and intentional communication as the new currency of sustainable digital growth.In a digital age where anyone can publish, the smartest creators are not those with the biggest follower counts, they are the ones who build real relationships, clear messaging and lasting engagement. Brendan Cain’s myth-busting session at the Billion Followers Summit threw down a bold challenge to the creator community: stop obsessing over fleeting virality and start creating content with real impact because in 2026 and beyond, true digital influence will be measured not just in numbers but in lasting connection.","Brendan kane debunks social media myths at 1 billion followers summit: 5 real growth strategies revealed. “rapid success isn’t random, it’s rooted in impactful storytelling and long-term audience relationships,” he stated.

Rule #2: Go big with the right collaborations

Rule #3: Tell your story with courage



Chris Do at Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit

Why Chris Do's principles matter now more than ever



Know who you are before asking others to know you.

Choose collaborators who elevate your voice.

Tell your story boldly, beautifully and authentically.





At Dubai’s Billion Followers Summit, the world’s biggest event for digital creators, one of the leading voices in branding and design took to the stage with a clear message that in a crowded digital world, being different is not optional but essential.Chris Do, CEO and Founder of The Futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators aiming to build a distinctive identity in an era where anyone with a phone can publish content. His session titled “How to Stand Out in a Noisy World” was one of the highlights of the fourth 1 Billion Followers Summit 2026 in Dubai, an event drawing tens of thousands of creators from around the world under the theme “Content for Good. ”Do’s first principle is deceptively simple: define precisely what you want before trying to build a public persona. In his view, clarity of intent serves as a magnetic force. Once you know your destination, your work naturally aligns with opportunities and audiences. Without that clarity, creators risk mimicking others and blending into the noise.“Don't expect everyone to know you. Instead, you should focus on building a distinctive personality that people will recognise.To build this distinctive personality, there are a number of assets or principles. The first is to define precisely what you want because if you do that, you will find that life organises things for you until you achieve what you want,” Do told the packed audience.The underlying idea here is that identity precedes audience, not the other way around. When creators are consistent in what they stand for, others are far more likely to gravitate toward them, not because their content is everywhere but because it matters somewhere. This kind of intentional positioning builds both followers and loyalty.Next, Do emphasised that the creators who want to make a mark should not shy away from associating with big names in their niche. Rather than playing it safe in isolated corners of the internet, ambitious creators should actively pursue collaborations with people, brands or platforms that already embody excellence in their field.This is not about ego or branding theatrics, it is about strategic visibility. When you align yourself with recognised authorities, your own voice gains credibility by association. For many content creators, the smartest next step is not more posting; it is more worthwhile partnerships.The third and most human of Do’s principles centres on storytelling. For a creator to stand out, audiences must first know you before they engage with what you create. In a world where trends and memes come and go, a creator’s unique story becomes their lasting currency.Do urged creators to have the courage to show opinions that differ from the mainstream, even if they seem strange or unconventional. However, he also stressed that difference must be meaningful, not different for the sake of attention. Authenticity, he argued, is the glue that connects form and substance, bold ideas with beautiful presentation.If your aesthetic and your values align, people don’t just follow you; they remember you. His point reflects a wider industry shift: audiences increasingly reward truth and depth over polished mimicry.Do’s session came against the backdrop of the 1 Billion Followers Summit’s explosive growth. With over 30,000 attendees, 15,000+ creators and 500+ expert speakers from around the world, the event underscores the creator economy’s evolving complexity and influence.As traditional media models continue to shift, with millions of videos uploaded daily and users spending hours on social platforms, creators are discovering that follower counts alone no longer guarantee success. The goal is no longer only visibility but distinctive influence and lasting connection. This idea is echoed by other speakers at the summit, who have urged creators to think beyond virality and focus on purpose, responsibility and real impact in their craft.For aspiring creators and seasoned influencers alike, Do’s framework offers a roadmap out of content fatigue and into meaningful growth:These principles are not tricks or shortcuts; they are foundations for a digital identity that withstands trends and algorithm changes, transforming creators from noise makers into distinctive voices in the global conversation. In a world where anyone can become a creator overnight, enduring influence is built not by copying what’s popular but by defining what’s you. As Chris Do put it in Dubai: clarity, collaboration and courageous storytelling are not just nice to have, they are the keys to standing out in an increasingly crowded world.","Chris do, ceo and founder of the futur, a global creative education platform followed by millions, shared his top principles for content creators.
