NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to decide afresh whether it is necessary for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to probe a 2018 complaint accusing e-commerce major Flipkart of abuse of its market dominant position.Taking up an appeal by Flipkart against a March 4, 2020, NCLAT order, a three-judge bench headed by CJI Surya Kant said it would be proper if the tribunal decided afresh whether a probe was necessary to be conducted in a 2018 complaint, which accused the e-commerce platform of resorting to predatory pricing.Fair-trade regulator CCI had rejected the complaint by All India Online Vendors Association. However, on appeal, NCLAT had asked CCI to conduct a probe on the complaint. In Dec 2020, SC had stayed the NCLAT order.","The supreme court asked the national company law appellate tribunal (nclat) to decide afresh whether it is necessary for the competition commission of india (cci) to probe a 2018 complaint.

'Exit India If...': Supreme Court Sends Sharp Message To Meta Over WhatsApp Policy, Indian User Data

How can you violate privacy of users like this, SC asks WA

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday warned popular messaging platform WhatsApp of a complete ban for sharing personal data of users, as it tore into the Mark Zuckerberg-controlled behemoth for exploiting and commercialising the data in violation of privacy rights and dismissing its defence of taking users’ consent as a sham deal where the latter had no cards.Dealing with appeals by WhatsApp, its parent company Meta which also owns Facebook, challenging a NCLAT decision that upheld Competition Commissions finding of abuse of dominant position against the social media giant, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi scorched it with admonitions for violating right to privacy of Indian citizens.“You have complete monopoly in the sector. What is the choice you give to users? The consent to share agreement is like the agreement between the lion and the lamb — either you give consent to share your personal data or you walk out of the WhatsApp service,” said the bench.“We will not allow you to share a single word of the personal data you gather from messages. This must be made clear to you. If you are ready to give an affidavit to undertake this, we will hear you. Otherwise, we will dismiss the appeals,” the CJI warned repeatedly.WhatsApp and Meta through senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Amit Sibal sought to argue that the data is shared after obtaining consent from the users and that the messages are encrypted in such a manner that these cannot be accessed by WhatsApp.SC posted the matter for hearing in the WhatsApp case on Feb 9 and asked the ministry of electronics and information technology to also file its response.The hearing was peppered with pithy critical observations from the bench, which said, “There is no question of sharing data. How can you violate the privacy of users like this? You share data with Facebook. Tomorrow Facebook will be sold to another, and you will transfer the entire data.”When Sibal said the data is shared with the consent of users, who are given a choice to opt out, CJI Kant asked, “What do you mean by opt out? What kind of option is given to users? How do poor vegetable vendors or rickshaw pullers or people in the rural areas understand what your terms and conditions are to decide to opt out? The language used in terms and conditions is so cleverly crafted, even some of us (judges) would not understand. ”A series of questions followed: “Every such term and condition must be examined from the perspective of a common user in this country. How many users understand the legal obligations you impose upon them? Where is the question of opting out when people do not understand those conditions? Show me from your mobile phone how this opt out condition operates?”The CJI said, “By now, you must have shared the personal data of millions of users… it is a decent way of committing theft of private information. We will not allow it to happen… Otherwise, you opt out of the country and withdraw your services.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Our private data, our personal data is not only sold but commercially exploited, making the users mere products.”The CJI said, “That is the point. Selling data is violating the right to privacy, which is so zealously guarded in this country and that data is exploited for purely commercial purposes.”Rohatgi referred to the pending petition by Karmanya Singh challenging the privacy policy of WhatsApp and persuaded the court to tag this issue with that case.But the bench brushed it aside and said, “Our simple query is — ask your domestic help whether she understands your privacy policy? It is not about the educated lot. It is about the majority who do not understand these and can’t fathom its consequences.”Mehta said the choice given to users is either give consent or opt out of the messaging service. Justice Bagchi said what is held against the platform is that the consent it gets is a manufactured one.The CJI said, “We will examine all aspects of this case. In the meantime, we will not allow the privacy of the citizens to be compromised in any manner.” Rohatgi said it would amount to dismissing the appeal even though the law allowed the platforms to be compliant in 18 months, that is by May 2027.When Sibal said WhatsApp services are for free, Justice Bagchi said, “Don’t say free of charge. What are the hidden charges? Every silo of data regarding an individual, irrespective of privacy, has a value. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act only addresses the privacy aspect. We would like to examine what the rent sharing of data is. We are concerned that our behavioural tendencies and trends can be utilised and monetised and thereby, your parent company can leverage it for an advantage in online advertising. ”Rohatgi said all over the world, WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted. Justice Bagchi said, “All over the world, I think the judiciaries will have to go into a more intensive and innovative oversight over these companies.“It is not the social service you are providing. You can make legitimate income. But your commercial venture cannot be at the cost of the rights of people of India,” said the CJI.",Supreme court warns popular messaging platform whatsapp of a complete ban for sharing personal data of users. The court tore into the mark zuckerberg-controlled behemoth for exploiting and commercialising the data in violation of privacy rights.

"'You can't play with right of privacy of citizens': SC's big warning to WhatsApp, Meta over 'take it or leave it' policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-cant-play-with-right-of-privacy-of-citizens-scs-big-warning-to-whatsapp-meta-over-take-it-or-leave-it-policy/articleshow/127878524.cms,"'Exit India If...': Supreme Court Sends Sharp Message To Meta Over WhatsApp Policy, Indian User Data

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued stern warning to WhatsApp and its parent company Meta Platforms against sharing users’ private data for targeted advertising, warning that citizens’ right to privacy could not be compromised for the business interests of a multinational corporation. A three-judge bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant said it would pass detailed orders on the issue on February 10.“We cannot allow citizens' privacy to be compromised for business interest of a MNC,” the Chief Justice said, as the court indicated it could ban such data sharing if safeguards were not ensured.The observations came while the court was hearing appeals filed by Meta and WhatsApp against a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal order that upheld a Rs 213 crore penalty imposed by the Competition Commission of India for abuse of dominance in the OTT messaging market.Making its position clear, the bench said user data could not be shared under the guise of consent or opt-out mechanisms. “We will not allow you to share even a single information, you cannot play with the rights of this country,” the Chief Justice said, adding, “you cannot violate the right of privacy of citizens.”Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Meta and WhatsApp, told the court that three appeals were before it, two by Meta and WhatsApp and one by the CCI.Counsel also informed the bench that the penalty amount had been deposited in full, subject to the outcome of the appeals, and that the CCI had not challenged the January 25 order.The court directed that the appeals be listed for final hearing before a three-judge bench, with counters to be filed within four weeks. It also ordered that the penalty deposited by Meta should not be withdrawn until further directions.Questioning the nature of consent claimed by WhatsApp, the Chief Justice said, “what is the choice? the choice is that even if you walk out of the Whatsapp facility we will share your data?” He added, “either you give an undertaking… we will not allow you to share a single word of the data.”The bench remained unconvinced by arguments that users had an opt-out option. “The right to privacy so zealously guarded in this country, and the kind of language you use, so cleverly crafted, even the street vendor will not understand,” the Chief Justice said. “Where is the question of opt-out? people do not understand that complication.”Calling the data-sharing framework unacceptable, the Chief Justice remarked, “this is decent way of committing theft of the private information, we will not allow you to do that.”Justice J Bagchi also raised concerns over whether users were meaningfully informed. “Who reads newspaper ads?” he asked, pointing out that platforms frequently send in-app messages but rely on newspaper notices when it comes to opt-out choices. He said the court would examine the value of the data being shared and how user behaviour was being monetised.The Solicitor General told the court that the choice offered to users was effectively “take it or leave it.” The bench also flagged concerns about vulnerable users, with the Chief Justice referring to people in remote areas and describing many as “silent consumers” who are “completely unaware of the system.”Reiterating the broader principle, the Chief Justice said, “any commercial venture cannot be at the costs of the rights of the people of this country.”(With inputs from Live Law)","The supreme court issued stern warning to whatsapp and its parent company meta platforms against sharing users’ private data.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip.

While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available.

Memphis prioritizes draft capital



The Memphis Grizzlies have reportedly agreed to trade their defensive cornerstone, Jaren Jackson Jr., to the Utah Jazz while keeping their window open for any potential offers for the flying machine, Ja Morant. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the sweeping eight-player deal, finalized just 48 hours before the February 5, 2026, trade deadline, marks a turning point for both teams.Memphis is sending Jackson Jr., along with John Konchar, Jock Landale, and Vince Williams Jr., to Salt Lake City, in exchange for Jazz’s Walter Clayton Jr., Kyle Anderson, Georges Niang, and Taylor Hendricks, along with three future first-round picks.Jared Jackson Jr. is a 2-time NBA ALL-Star (2023, 2025) and NBA Defensive Player of the Year for 2022-23. His acquisition by the Utah Jazz shows their approach towards a more win-based model. Despite Grizzlies' struggling 15-35 record, Jared has proven his productivity. He’s currently averaging 19.2 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game while shooting 47.5% from the field and 35.9% from the arc. The 26-year old is also known for his elite rim protection, and is averaging 4 averaging 4.8 defensive rebounds and 0.9 offensive rebounds.He also led the league in blocks for two consecutive seasons (2022, 2023)In July 2025, Jaren Jackson Jr. agreed to a 5-year, $205 million contract as per Spotrac. But this deal begins next season, 2026-27, and will give him an annual salary of $49 million. He's set to earn $35 million under his current $104.7 million rookie extension contract.With Jackson’s addition to the roster, the Jazz would be aiming for next season’s playoff contention.For the Grizzlies, trading Jaren Jackson Jr. comes with the intention of a full-scale roster reset as the deal brings in essential draft capital. It includes Lakers' unprotected 2027 first-round pick, the most favorable 2027 pick from a pool of Cleveland, Minnesota, and Utah, and a 2031 Phoenix Suns first-round pick.Memphis also gained promising young talents like Taylor Hendricks and rookie Walter Clayton Jr., with Kyle Anderson returning to the franchise for a second stint.From the financial point of view, through the trade Grizzlies get a record-breaking $28.8 million trade exception, which gives the front office flexibility to negotiate future deals.

CZI’s focus on Biohub

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The chan zuckerberg initiative (czi) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

GURGAON: A wedding video of popular Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility after visuals surfaced showing large amounts of cash and gold being presented during wedding rituals, even as the gifts were described as “daan” (donation) and not dowry.Panwar, a resident of Gurugram and originally from Indri village in Sohna, is going to get married to Dr Tithi. Wedding ceremonies held on January 30 sparked criticism.In a reel uploaded on Panwar’s Instagram account, a person is seen reading out a detailed list of items allegedly given as “daan”. The narration mentions, “Ladke ki chain saade paanch tole ki,” followed by a list that includes a 4 tola bracelet, two gold rings for engagement and marriage, jewellery for the groom’s father, uncle, brothers, mother, sister-in-law and the bride’s sister. The video further claims that a total of 21 tolas of gold and Rs 71 lakh in cash were given.The video quickly went viral, drawing sharp criticism from social media users who questioned whether influencers were normalising dowry under the guise of tradition. “Are influencers now promoting dowry?” one user asked. Another commented, “We live in a society where all of this is applauded. No wonder we’re so doomed.” Some users even questioned why no legal action had been taken if such practices were being displayed publicly.A particularly pointed comment noted that the bride is a highly educated doctor, saying it was disturbing that such practices continued even when the woman involved is professionally accomplished.Arun Panwar began his YouTube career in 2019 and is known for automobile-related content such as car reviews, mileage tests, feature breakdowns and ownership experiences.He holds a BCA degree and has built a strong digital presence, with over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and around one million followers on Instagram.A car enthusiast, Panwar owns several premium vehicles, including a Kia Seltos, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner and Mahindra Thar.The viral wedding video has once again brought the issue of dowry into focus, raising questions about the role of social media influencers and whether rebranding such exchanges as “gifts” or “donations” can obscure practices that are legally prohibited and socially contested.",Haryana youtuber arun pawar's wedding raises eyebrows on social media.

Why are IT sector stocks crashing?

The sell-off in IT stocks was triggered by an announcement from US-based AI startup Anthropic, which introduced a product aimed at corporate legal teams.

startup Anthropic, which introduced a product aimed at corporate legal teams. The company, known for developing the Claude chatbot, said the tool can automate a range of legal tasks such as reviewing contracts, sorting non-disclosure agreements, managing compliance processes, drafting legal briefs and generating standardised responses.

The launch has deepened the cautious outlook on software stocks, as investors grow increasingly uneasy about rising competition and potential pressure on margins due to rapid AI adoption.

Market participants worry that as artificial intelligence solutions become more advanced, technology firms may find it harder to maintain pricing power and protect profitability.

IT stocks crash! Shares of Indian IT majors Infosys Wipro , HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ), and Persistent Systems tanked in opening trade on Wednesday, dragging Sensex down by over 100 points. The decline was due to concerns about the growing impact of artificial intelligence which intensified following Anthropic’s launch of new workplace productivity tools.The negative sentiment mirrored weakness on Wall Street, where the technology-heavy benchmark Nasdaq declined 1.4 per cent, erasing nearly $300 billion in market capitalisation across the sector.Shares of major IT companies, including Infosys, Wipro, HCL Tech and Persistent Systems, slid as much as 6 per cent in early trade.International brokerage Jefferies said in a February 2 report that it has cut back its allocation to the information technology sector as part of a reshuffle of its India model portfolio.Following the revision, the IT sector now carries a weight of 5.6 in Jefferies’ India portfolio, well below the 9.7 weighting assigned to the sector in the MSCI India index.The brokerage’s guarded approach comes amid persistent foreign portfolio investor selling, with overseas funds having withdrawn about $34 billion from Indian equities over the last 16 months, a period during which IT stocks have faced some of the heaviest pressure.US equities also reflected the technology-led weakness. The S&P 500 declined 0.84 per cent to settle at 6,917.81, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.43 per cent to 23,255.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average proved relatively more stable, closing 0.34 per cent lower at 49,240.99.Among major stocks, Nvidia and Microsoft fell by nearly 3 per cent each. Alphabet slid 1.2 per cent ahead of its earnings announcement on Wednesday, and Amazon slipped 1.8 per cent before releasing its quarterly results on Thursday.Addressing market concerns, Anthropic clarified that its newly launched plugin is not intended to offer legal advice. “AI-generated analysis should be reviewed by licensed attorneys before being relied upon for legal decisions,” the company said. In addition to the legal-oriented tool, Anthropic unveiled a series of open-source offerings designed to automate a wide spectrum of professional activities, ranging from sales functions to customer service operations.Anthropic, established in 2021, was founded by chief executive Dario Amodei along with several former employees of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.","Shares of major it companies, including infosys, wipro, hcl tech and persistent systems, slid as much as 6 per cent in early trade.

Successful bidders have 10 working days after the auction closes to complete payment, in cash for amounts up to Dh50,000 or by manager’s cheque or credit card for larger sums.Dubai’s vehicle number plates are more than just identifiers. They have become symbols of status, individuality and even investment potential. Unique or easily memorable combinations, especially those with fewer digits, often command strong interest and high bids from collectors, car enthusiasts and business owners alike. Last year’s auctions illustrate just how lucrative and competitive these events can be: distinctive numbers have historically sold for millions of dirhams, with some rare plates like AA17 fetching over Dh8 million and total auction revenues reaching into the tens of millions.These auctions not only give buyers the chance to stand out on the roads but also reflect an evolving luxury culture where plates are viewed as status symbols, similar to personalised accessories or exclusive registrations seen in other global cities.

Online automotive forums and owner communities frequently discuss the value of certain plates, noting that 4-digit and 3-digit numbers tend to retain value better and can sometimes be resold through private deals when market demand is high.For many residents, winning a premium plate is not only about personal identity on the road, it can also be a status milestone reflecting years in the city, business success or even cultural significance when specific numbers have special meaning in local or global contexts.Dubai’s plate auctions have a track record of remarkable sales and strong interest from the public. For instance, a previous auction saw the plate AA17 sell for Dh8.02 million, contributing to total auction revenues of over Dh69 million. Other combinations also commanded high bids, showing that the market for distinctive plates can be robust, especially when collectors target rare sequences.These historical successes set the stage for high expectations in the 2026 auction.

Texas journalist 'exposes' Indian recruiters behind 'H-1B only' job ads on LinkedIn: 'When I call the numbers...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-journalist-exposes-indian-recruiters-behind-h-1b-only-job-ads-on-linkedin-when-i-call-the-numbers-/articleshow/127894199.cms,"



Texas journalist Sara Gonzales, who knocked on the doors of a few H-1B addresses in Texas, exposing a 'major scam' in the state, has now targeted Indian recruiters offering 'H-1B only' jobs at various US locations on LinkedIn. Gonzales said she visited the websites of the companies and found a common pattern: most of the contact numbers given on the sites do not work, the companies have their offices in India; they have unpolished/ wrong choice of English words on their sites; and they rent out virtual remote coworking space so that they can have an address but no one is there.""Let me be clear to the fraudsters. We are not done. Keep watching. It may be you we are exposing very shortly,"" Gonzales said. The journalist added that it was her expose that prompted Texas Governor Greg Abbott to announce a freeze on H-1B hiring ban in state agencies. Also, Texas AG Ken Paxton announced an investigation into three private companies.Gonzales said she researched for an evening and found an avalanche of information about Indian recruiters posting 'H-1B only' ads on LinkedIn. Revealing their names and the companies they have been hiring for, Gonzales read out one advertisement that was offering jobs only for H-4s, who are dependents of H-1Bs.""This is the whole scheme. You get in, you get to bring your whole family, you bring your children. Then your children need to be taught by another H-1B. And that H-1B brings their family in, and they bring their children. It is a recurring, never-ending cycle,"" Gonzales said adding that H-1B is supposed to be used only when American talent is not found for some very niche skills.The IT consulting firms are double-dipping as they don't pay what they get from the companies to the H-1Bs they hire, the journalist alleged. ""If you are a Green Card holder, if you did immigrate to this country, if you came to this country as a foreign national and paid your dues, and you are now a Green Card holder, you still do not need to apply. We don't want you. We want the non-immigrant visas. What a slap in the face,"" Gonzales said.","Texas journalist sara gonzales, who knocked on the doors of a few h-1b addresses in texas, exposing a'major scam' in the state, has now targeted indian recruiters.

Indian-American businessman Kanwal Singh Rekhi, who became the first Indian-American to take a company public in Silicon Valley, said he is worried about the future amid the divisive atmosphere. The rhetoric against Indians has been heating up and policymakers are accusing Indians of cheating immigration policies, making it harder for Indians to get visas. The overall messaging is that Indians are not welcome in the US, Rekhi noted, saying that when he came to the US, the situation was different. America invited Indian talents not out of generosity but out of necessity.Rekhi traced back the migration of Indians to the US and said the country in the 1960s was not producing enough scientists and engineers and the US was falling behind the Soviet Union. ""So in 1967, with barely enough money to last a semester, I traveled from rural India to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to pursue a master’s degree in engineering. When we beat the Soviets to the moon, the fate of India and the US became inextricably linked,"" the veteran businessman wrote for San Francisco Chronicle.""After working in the defense industry, I founded Excelan, a startup that produced the ethernet boards that were foundational to the early internet, making me the first Indian American to take a company public in Silicon Valley.At its height, we employed nearly 1,000 people, whose lives and the lives of their families were transformed when we were acquired. Later, as an investor, I funded over 100 startups that created tens of thousands of jobs and pumped billions of dollars into the economy. ""Immigrants are more likely to start a business because they have no safety net, and survival is mandatory.""When I founded my company in the early 1980s, Indian American entrepreneurs were rare. Today, we are everywhere. Roughly a quarter of startups in Silicon Valley involve Indian Americans as founders, investors or board members. Indian Americans have led some of the world’s most influential companies, including Google, Microsoft, Starbucks, IBM and Pepsi. Though we make up about 1.6% of the U.S. population, we account for over 10% of the country’s CEOs, physicians and professors. By nearly every metric — education, income, entrepreneurship — Indian Americans are a case study in what effective immigration policy can produce for the country.""Commenting on the H-1B row that Indians get the maximum of these non-immigrant work visas and then steal jobs from Americans, Rekhi said that it is true that most H-1Bs go to Indians but it is also true that American technology leadership is built in collaboration with foreign talent, particularly Indian talent, he said. The front offices in America and the back offices in India helped both countries and if this trend is reversed now, both will be affected.""India just became the fourth-largest economy in the world, and it will likely become the third-largest by 2030. It’s imperative that the world’s oldest democracy (America) and the world’s largest democracy (India) work together, not only to stay ahead of China on the technological front lines but to stem the rise of authoritarianism globally,"" the investor added.","Kanwal singh rekhi, the first indian-american to take a company public in silicon valley, said he is worried about the future amid the divisive atmosphere.

MrBeast mocks Elon Musk’s SpaceX and xAI merger announcement with a cheeky tweet that sends X into a frenzy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/mrbeast-mocks-elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-merger-announcement-with-a-cheeky-tweet-that-sends-x-into-a-frenzy/articleshow/127876699.cms,"MrBeast’s viral reaction steals spotlight after Elon Musk merges SpaceX and xAI





Once again, Elon Musk has taken the technological discourse to the next level, now integrating SpaceX and xAI as one corporate. It was a soft release in the form of an official release, but its news made an immediate ripple effect on social media, among investors, and throughout the tech community. Having been combined with an equally staggering valuation of $1.25 trillion, the move announced a radical gesture of an ever closer approach of integration between artificial intelligence, space exploration and digital communication.The interest of the public also increased when a YouTube sensation, MrBeast, joined the discussion with a sarcastic comment that also went viral. His reaction summarised the curiosity and disbelief people are having of the widening influence Musk is having on linked platforms, particularly as concerns remain as to how these ecosystems may intersect in the future.The announcement gained traction after Musk shared a celebratory message on X. “To the stars! @SpaceX& @xAI are now one company,” he wrote, amplifying an already historic update. Soon after, MrBeast reacted with a line that resonated widely with online users. “So I’m now posting on a SpaceX owned site? lol,” he posted.The humor masked a deeper debate. While the merger technically joins SpaceX with xAI, the artificial intelligence firm behind Grok, many users questioned how closely X itself could become tied into the structure.Some imagined Mars-based content. Others framed the move as a defining moment in human innovation, blending communication, intelligence, and off-planet capability.Musk addressed the purpose of the merger directly in a statement outlining its long-term vision. According to him, xAI joined SpaceX to ""Accelerate Humanity’s Future.”The statement continued, “SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform. This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars. ”Whether this vision reshapes industries or redraws boundaries, the merger has already achieved one thing. It has made the future feel closer, louder, and impossible to ignore.","Mrbeast’s viral reaction steals spotlight after elon musk merges spacex and xai.

NEW DELHI: The focus has been on shrimps and textiles, but Indian carpets and rugs have seen a bruising year with exports slipping nearly 9% to $735 million between April and Nov. Lowering of tariffs is expected to come as a boost for the highly-labour intensive sector.While overall exports are down 4% to $1.3 billion during the first eight months of the fiscal year, the sheer weight of the American market has been enough to upset the cart for Indian players.Exports to the UK and UAE are up, but all the other markets add up to less than what is shipped to the US by Indian companies concentrated in centres around Varanasi and in Jammu & Kashmir.Over the last few months, India’s exports to the US had fallen 32% in Sept, followed by a 22% decline in Oct and 9% drop in Nov, commerce department data showed.When it comes to carpets and floor coverings, China is the world’s largest player, according to data on the World Integrated Trade Solutions website. But India’s main competitor is Türkiye that had enjoyed a tariff advantage over the last few months when the US slapped a hefty 50% tariff.","Indian carpets and rugs exports slip nearly 9% to $735 million between april and nov.
