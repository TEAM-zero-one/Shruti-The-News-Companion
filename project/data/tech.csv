"India Proverty Rate: Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"Poll Do you believe that the updated international poverty line will help in addressing poverty more effectively? Yes, it will provide a clearer picture. No, it will complicate measures.

NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade. World bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data. The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23. World bank introduced the international poverty line (ipl) in 1990.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121700951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-965504,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Hyderabad unit to manufacture 'key structural sections' of Rafale

NEW DELHI: French aerospace major Dassault Aviation has tied up with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) to manufacture fuselage of Rafale fighters at Hyderabad, as part of the overall Rs 63,887 crore (almost ₹7 billion) deal inked by India in April to acquire 26 maritime variants of the omni-role jets.The inter-governmental deal, under which the 26 Rafale-M jets will be delivered in the 2028-2030 timeframe, had included the setting up of a production facility for fuselages as well as MRO facilities for aircraft engines, sensors and weapons in India.With the IAF first inducting 36 Rafales for Rs 59,000 crore and then the 26 Rafale-M jets for the Navy, the French fighter is the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Under the four production transfer agreements between Dassault Aviation and TASL, the Hyderabad facility will manufacture ""key structural sections"" of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section for India and global markets.""The first fuselage sections are expected to roll out in FY 2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month,"" a joint Dassault-TASL statement said on Thursday.""For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, saudi arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its worldwide developers conference (wwdc) on monday, june 9.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s success secret revealed by his biographer: He is powered by fear of failing and that’s why he never slows down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-success-secret-revealed-by-his-biographer-he-is-powered-by-fear-of-failing-and-thats-why-he-never-slows-down/articleshow/121675759.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success.

Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently.

Smaller centres leave metros behind in hiring pace: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/smaller-centres-leave-metros-behind-in-hiring-pace-report/articleshow/121713951.cms,"NEW DELHI: Small cities and towns witnessed a sharp surge in hiring - more than double the pace seen in metros - driven by robust growth in the BFSI, manufacturing, retail, and IT sectors. This trend marks a significant shift towards decentralised economic growth, underscoring the rapid rise of tier-2 cities as emerging talent hubs, with opportunities now expanding beyond traditional urban centres. Job openings in tier-2 cities rose nearly 42%, compared to a 19% increase in tier-1 cities, according to the Randstad Talent Insights Report 2025 shared exclusively with TOI.The first edition of the report, drawn from data in the six-month period - Sept 2024 to Feb 2025-captures insights across six key industries: banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI), manufacturing and automotive, IT, pharma, healthcare & life sciences (PHL), retail, FMCG & FMCD, and energy and utilities.Anjali Raghuvanshi, chief people officer & senior director (business innovation) at Randstad India, a talent company, said, "" Our report indicates that tier-1 cities maintain a robust hiring outlook across all surveyed sectors. More interestingly, tier-2 and 3 cities are rapidly gaining ground, emerging as hiring hotspots, thus reflecting the vast potential and widespread distribution of talent across the country.The impressive growth trajectory of these cities can be credited to their growing economic relevance, a steady pipeline of skilled talent from quality educational institutions, and a concentrated push towards infrastructure development.""Among tier-1 cities, Bengaluru solidified its leadership in talent demand, exhibiting higher hiring numbers and a greater share of demand across all experience levels and sectors. Mumbai further strengthened its dominance in the energy and utilities sector at the middle and senior levels. It also reinforces its position as a key talent hub across all levels for the BFSI, retail, FMCG, and FMCD industries.Among tier-2 cities, Chandigarh made an impactful rise to top rankings and witnessed surge in hiring across all industries at different levels.Gandhinagar and Aurangabad joined the list of tier-2 cities in this edition. During the period, Vadodara showed a big surge in hiring numbers, rankings, and share of demand at all levels in the energy & utilities, PHL, and automotive & manufacturing industries.Further, under the BFSI sector, investment banking, business operations, and business analyst roles take the top three spots in terms of hiring demand across all levels. The role of a cyber fraud analyst entered the skill portfolio for the first time to feature in the Top 20 skills.With more advanced cyber frauds in the digital age, the role has opened up job opportunities, both in tier-1 and tier-2 cities, the report adds.

Bupa weighs foray into private hospitals market in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bupa-weighs-foray-into-private-hospitals-market-in-india/articleshow/121713883.cms,"How do you assess the Indian health insurance market in India?

In markets like Europe, UK, Australia , Latin America, you have a Bupa Payvider programme where you provide not just insurance and easy claims processing, but also a network of healthcare providers. These include dental and mental health clinics, and hospitals. Any plans to start hospitals and such other services in India?

Inflation in health costs is a concern for customers, which also sees policy costs go up. Your views?

Apart from metros and bigger cities, how do you see the opportunity in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns and rural India?

India is a growing country, with lots of construction and other infrastructure activities happening. Do you think that dust, pollution, and long traffic snarls in congested cities create health hazards for people?

British health insurance major Bupa is looking to enter the fast-growing private hospital and healthcare market in India, currently dominated by players like Max Healthcare, Apollo Hospitals, Fortis, Narayana Health, and Medanta, as the company grows its engagement beyond the traditional insurance business (Niva Bupa), global CEO Inaki Ereno told TOI in an interview. Excerpts:The Indian health insurance market is the most attractive and best in the world. It's still under-penetrated, and we believe there will be many more people requiring private medical insurance. We need more beds, more hospitals, more clinics, and more insurance here... In terms of our own growth, it's been 35% over the last three years. We're clearly seeing a massive opportunity.With Payvider, we are not just insurers but also providers. Of the claims that our patients go through, we always want around 25% in a place called Bupa - in a Bupa clinic, in a Bupa hospital, in a Bupa digital place.This helps us to learn the cost of things, and also allows us to personalise the service.It is too soon to talk about India. I cannot commit yet on the dates but, yes, you can expect that Bupa will keep investing here... we do have a plan, a commitment to study the situation and be ambitious and come up with something big. We believe that 25% of the activity that we do should be run in a place like Bupa.When it comes to the cost of claims, there is inflation across the world. This is why developing a private medical insurance market helps everybody. When you have more people into private medical insurance, that helps lower costs of claims.Normally, premiums go up with inflation. So, they will not reduce. Are we expecting a big increase in premiums? The answer is no. We expect premiums to go in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI).We are clearly targeting markets beyond the top 50-60 cities. We think there's a massive opportunity to get people into the fold of insurance. India is at a very nascent stage, and awareness is still low with respect to health insurance.The answer is yes, though no one can make a direct correlation in elements like these. But we are working with the Norman Foster Foundation to understand what is the impact that living in a particular city has on your health, including in Delhi.","British health insurance major bupa is looking to enter the fast-growing private hospital and healthcare market in india.
