"Societies can’t function without reliable access to space, SatCom is ‘dual use oxygen’: Viasat prez",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/societies-cant-function-without-reliable-access-to-space-satcom-is-dual-use-oxygen-viasat-prez/articleshow/128766706.cms,"NEW DELHI: Global communications company Viasat on Tuesday said societies cannot function without reliable access to space, describing satellite communications as the “dual use oxygen"" that supports missions ranging from weather forecasting to early warning systems.“Without assured, resilient global SatCom, we would all be in the dark,” Ben Palmer, President of Viasat Commercial, said while addressing the opening plenary session at the DefSat 2026 conference held at New Delhi's Manekshaw Centre on Tuesday.Highlighting the strategic importance of assured spectrum access and resilient satellite communications, Palmer underscored the role of these technologies in safeguarding national security and sustaining economic stability.Palmer stressed on the necessity of assured connectivity across alternate orbits and radio frequency bands. He also said, “We're looking at ways to ensure govts have access to assured connectivity via alternate orbits and alternate radio frequency spectrum. We are innovating to deliver cyber and EW resilience, access to different spectrum and new ways to deliver these key enabling capabilities.”The three-day dialogue, which convenes military leadership, policymakers, and industry partners, focused on the future of space-enabled security.The discussion also addressed the increasing use of uncrewed systems in modern conflict.Palmer pointed to recent developments in Ukraine as evidence of how such platforms achieve military effects without risking personnel. He explained that Viasat is focused on developing compact terminals, some no larger than a coffee cup, to provide beyond line-of-sight communications for tactical uncrewed platforms.Regarding India's strategic position, Palmer acknowledged the govt's approach to space sovereignty as “long term, strategic and wise”. He said that India's resistance to market dominance by others in international fora helps maintain freedom of choice. “The grand strategic approach which the Govt of India is adopting to assure its space sovereignty is impressive. This isn't just about 'Make in India' and assuring freedom of operation, it's also about the responsible, pragmatic approach that India has adopted,"" he said. Viasat, which recently integrated Inmarsat, continues to partner with local institutions like BSNL to build domestic capabilities.Besides exhibition by defence and space startups at Manekshaw Centre, DefSat 2026 witnessed eminent military, defence, space and cyberspace experts as part of panel discussions.Building on the success of its first three editions, collectively drawing 500+ participants from 20+ countries, 80+ speakers and representation from 60+ organisations, DefSat 2026 (Feb 24–26) on Day 1 featured a broad agenda spanning operational doctrine, industrial collaboration, technology resilience and geopolitical partnerships.Subba Rao Pavuluri, president, SIA-India, said, “The DefSat 2026 conference underscores a critical strategic reality: an estimated 70–80% of modern military operations today rely on space-based capabilities, underscoring the rising centrality of space in India’s national security architecture. Day One marked a strong turnout as the conference witnessed 600 registered military leadership, govt officials, diplomats, global industry representatives, startups, academia, and strategic experts. ”","Satellite communications are the “dual use oxygen” that supports missions ranging from weather forecasting to early warning systems.

IT stocks are once again in focus, but for all the red reasons. The sector is once again suffering sharp losses after Anthropic highlighted the potential of its Claude Code tool to modernise legacy systems built on COBOL, triggering fresh concerns across the sector. Infosys slipped over 3% while shares of HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Persistent Systems also dipped more than 2% each, while TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro also fell around 2%.The weakness across heavyweights pulled the Nifty IT index reached 30,380.55, down 1,169.95 or 3.71% at 11 am. On the NSE, Infosys was down 47.40 points or 3.57%, to 1,280.10. At the same time, TCS fell to 2,599.60, slashing 76.70 points or 2.87% and HCL Tech trimmed 62.20 points or 4.36% to 1,364.00. Wipro tumbled to 201.24 down 4.65 points or 2.26%. Mphasis and Persistent Systems also traded in red, down over 2% and 5% respectively.Market reaction followed Anthropic’s statement that its Claude Code offering can automate a significant portion of the exploration and analysis involved in COBOL modernisation, ET reported. This segment has been an important business area for IBM, which has long promoted mainframe systems designed for large-scale transaction processing environments where COBOL is extensively used.COBOL, or Common Business-Oriented Language, was developed in the late 1950s and continues to be widely deployed in business data processing applications such as payment processing and retail transaction systems. Anthropic estimates that about 95% of ATM transactions in the US still run on COBOL, underlining the scale of potential AI-led cost disruption.“Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year,” Anthropic said in its latest blog post.Selling pressure in the IT pack had already intensified earlier this month when Anthropic unveiled another AI product aimed at automating a wide range of professional workflows. The development rekindled worries that advances in artificial intelligence could chip away at the profitability and competitive moats of traditional IT services providers.","Infosys slipped over 3% while shares of hcl technologies, mphasis and persistent systems also dipped more than 2%.

“The

New World Order of News

: Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,”

India’s digital public infrastructure is transforming the way citizens interact with the state, the economy, and each other. From governance and finance to identity verification, these systems operate at population scale, reshaping expectations around access, trust, and authentication. For the media industry, this is more than a technological shift, it is a redefinition of the role of news organisations within the ecosystem of digital citizenship.Digital infrastructure increasingly functions as public architecture, determining who can access information and how quickly. Newsrooms must navigate this landscape carefully, understanding that technology now shapes reach, availability, and audience engagement. Authentication and verification systems are establishing new norms for credibility, positioning aligned newsrooms to maintain audience trust in a world of information overload and misinformation.While these systems can broaden reach, they also carry risks of exclusion. Uneven connectivity, literacy gaps, and digital access can deepen divides if not accounted for. Media strategies that prioritise inclusion can ensure these systems expand opportunity rather than widen gaps.Against this backdrop, DNPA Conclave 2026 emerges as a pivotal forum for shaping the future of Indian journalism. To be held in New Delhi on February 26 under the themethe conclave will bring together policymakers, media leaders, and industry experts to examine the intersections of news, governance, and digital innovation.Through curated panels and expert-led sessions, the conclave will spotlight emerging trends, shared challenges, and strategic pathways for India’s digital news ecosystem. It will explore how news organisations can thrive in a landscape defined by large-scale public technology, trust-by-design systems, and inclusion imperatives.India’s scale and ambition have captured global attention. International observers view the country as a laboratory for integrating technology and public interest. For media organisations, this adds responsibility and opportunity. They operate under a global spotlight, translating public infrastructure into trusted news for millions. When technology becomes civic architecture, media becomes a stakeholder and not just a user. Engaging with this transformation is essential for credibility, relevance, and sustainable growth.Some years test resilience. Others test clarity. 2026 demands both but rewards only the latter. This is the year when industry leaders must decide what they stand for, how they operate, and whom they serve. It is the year the rules of the next media era will be written decisively.The Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) represents leading digital media organisations across India. Committed to strengthening credible journalism, upholding ethical standards, and enabling sustainable growth, DNPA Conclave 2026 will be the stage where these defining questions are debated, directions are charted, and the future of Indian journalism takes shape.","India’s digital public infrastructure is transforming the way citizens interact with the state, the economy, and each other.

The digital news industry has delayed an uncomfortable conversation for too long: how to fund credible journalism sustainably in an environment conditioned to expect content for free. While reach expanded rapidly, revenue models struggled to keep pace. Advertising alone, once seen as the backbone of digital media, is no longer sufficient to support the depth and diversity journalism demands.For years, audiences were trained to believe that news online should be free. The value behind reported stories, fieldwork, verification, legal checks, and investigations was rarely explained. The result is what many in the industry now call the “free-content illusion”.At the same time, revenue streams have become fragmented. Digital advertising no longer carries the weight it once did.This economic reckoning is forcing editors and management teams to confront difficult trade-offs. Cutting costs often means cutting depth, investigative capacity, and diversity of voices. Scale without sustainability offers diminishing returns. The challenge is not only about finding new revenue models, but about rebuilding a fair value exchange between journalism and its audiences, clearly and transparently.If journalism is expected to function as a public service, someone must fund that service.These trends will be discussed in detail at the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026 in New Delhi on 26 February. The theme this year is ‘The New World Order of News: Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future’, highlighting how Indian media is navigating the balance between reach, purpose, and ownership.The Digital News Publishers Association is a leading industry body representing digital media organisations across India. It works to strengthen credible journalism, uphold ethical standards, and support sustainable growth in the digital news ecosystem.DNPA Conclave 2026 provides a platform for policymakers, media leaders, and experts to explore emerging trends, shared challenges, and the future roadmap for India’s digital media.

IBM Shares Crash



IBM shares crash

IBM share price crash: Anthropic’s latest business move has hit shares of International Business Machines Corp or IBM hard. The stock tumbled on Monday after artificial intelligence startup Anthropic announced that its Claude Code tool can assist in upgrading COBOL, an aging programming language predominantly operated on IBM systems.In a blog post, Anthropic said that updating COBOL systems traditionally required large teams of consultants working for years to map complex workflows. However, it noted that “tools like Claude Code can automate the exploration and analysis phases that consume most of the effort in COBOL modernization.”Since the majority of mainframe computers running COBOL are produced by IBM, the development triggered heavy selling in the company’s stock. The decline reflects growing investor concerns that advances in artificial intelligence could challenge the growth outlook of established legacy technology firms.The stock dropped as much as 13% during intraday trading, marking its steepest single-day fall since March 2020. Following the slide, IBM shares are down 26% for February, putting them on course for their largest monthly percentage decline since at least 1968, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.A substantial portion of IBM’s operations is still anchored in its mainframe segment. These large-scale, client-owned systems support applications written in COBOL, a programming language that predates most modern coding frameworks used across today’s technology landscape.Mainframes remain widely used by institutions requiring high levels of stability and reliability, including financial institutions and government agencies.On Friday, Anthropic rolled out an additional security capability within its Claude AI model, a move that triggered broad-based selling in cybersecurity stocks.Software shares have generally struggled this year amid mounting concerns about disruption driven by artificial intelligence. A leading software-focused exchange-traded fund has declined 27% so far this year, putting it on pace for its steepest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the market pressure has followed the launch of new AI-driven tools from companies such as Anthropic, OpenAI and Alphabet Inc. Investors are increasingly concerned that “vibe coding,” or the use of AI to generate software code, could enable users to build their own applications. This shift may reduce reliance on established software offerings, potentially affecting revenue growth, profit margins and pricing power for legacy technology firms.","Ai startup anthropic announced that its claude code tool can assist in upgrading cobol, an aging programming language predominantly operated on ibm systems.

From Viral Clip To Trust Crisis: Erika Kirk Faces Mounting Backlash | WATCH

Candace Owens stirs internal rift debate after releasing Erika Kirk investigation trailer

Coming soon...





After Candace Owens posted the trailer for her new investigative series on YouTube , The Bride of Charlie: An Investigative Series, she caused a new political and media firestorm. The preview, which is mostly about Erika Kirk, quickly started a lot of talk on social media and in conservative media.Supporters say the series is an attempt to find the truth, while critics say it could lead to more speculation and harassment. Within hours of the trailer coming out, people started arguing about it online instead of just being curious.The controversy intensified when a viral post highlighted the silence of prominent allies connected to Charlie Kirk. The post read: ""Candace Owens released the trailer of her 'exposé' on Erika Kirk. This would be a good time for Charlie Kirk's 'friends' to say something, anything about this. The only one who told Candace to leave Erika alone was @MattWalshBlog, and that was 2 months ago. Where are the rest?"" The message quickly circulated, drawing attention to internal tensions and placing pressure on conservative commentators to respond.Candace Owens's brand is based on combative commentary and investigative stories that go against what most people think.With The Bride of Charlie, she seems to be taking that formula and turning it into a series of digital reports. The trailer suggests that the show will take a close look at the personal relationships, power, and rumored behind-the-scenes dynamics of Charlie Kirk's inner circle.People who watch the project say that it comes at a time when conservative media figures are getting more attention from both supporters and critics. Some people think the show is a form of accountability journalism within the movement itself. Some people say it could turn private lives into public spectacles for political gain.Matt Walsh's earlier call for restraint has come back into the spotlight, especially since other well-known people haven't said anything. That silence has become part of the story, leading to rumors about loyalty, disagreements within the company, and the risk of damaging the company's reputation.We don't know yet if the series will reveal true information or just stir up more controversy. One thing is for sure: the trailer has already reached one goal. It has gotten people's attention, made them talk about it, and made sure that when the full series comes out, there will be a ready audience that is watching closely.","Candace owens has stirred major controversy after releasing the trailer for her youtube investigative series the bride of charlie.

Elon Musk calls AI models of Anthropic 'Evil'

AI giant Anthropic recently accused Chinese AI labs of stealing data from its Claude model. Now Tesla CEO Elon Musk has weighed in with sharp criticism. In a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk suggested that Anthropic itself is guilty of similar practices. He also pointed out to reports that the company used copyrighted books and free online data to train its models. “Anthropic is guilty of stealing training data at massive scale and has had to pay multi-billion dollar settlements for their theft. This is just a fact,” wrote Musk.According to a report by Business Insider, in a statement Anthropic said that these Chinese albs orchestrated industrial-scale distillation campaigns, creating roughly 24,000 fraudulent Claude accounts that generated more than 16 million exchanges in violation of its terms of service and regional restrictions. For those unaware, distillation is a process where smaller model is trained on the outputs of a larger one, is widely used in AI development. However, Anthropic argues that its Chinese rivals are exploiting the practice to steal capabilities at a fraction of the time and cost it would take to build independently.Musk’s criticism comes amid heightened tensions between US and Chinese AI companies. While Anthropic insists its rivals are stealing intellectual property, Musk and others have pointed out that US firms themselves face scrutiny over how they source training data.Last year, Anthropic settled a $1.5 billion lawsuit with authors and publishers over claims it used copyrighted books without permission.Earlier this month, Elon Musk criticised rival AI company Anthropic whose recent AI updates triggered a nearly trillion-dollar selloff in enterprise software stocks and accused its models of being ‘misanthropic and evil’. The comments made by Musk came in response to Anthropic’s announcement on social media platform X (formerly known as twitter) that it has closed $30 billion funding round at the valuation of $380 billion. It is one of the largest private tech raises to date. “We’ve raised $30B in funding at a $380B post-money valuation. This investment will help us deepen our research, continue to innovate in products, and ensure we have the resources to power our infrastructure expansion as we make Claude available everywhere our customers are,” wrote Anthropic.In response to this post, Musk alleged that Anthropic’s AI systems exhibit racial and demographic bias. “Your AI hates Whites & Asians, especially Chinese, heterosexuals and men. This is misanthropic and evil. Fix it. Frankly, I don’t think there is anything you can do to escape the inevitable irony of Anthropic ending up being Misanthropic. You were doomed to this fate when you chose your name. The Name of the Wind,” wrote Musk.",Anthropic recently accused chinese ai labs of stealing data from its claude model.

'Overstayed in India': Redditor says H-1B visa got canceled at Abu Dhabi preclearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/overstayed-in-india-redditor-says-h-1b-visa-got-canceled-at-abu-dhabi-preclearance/articleshow/128756228.cms,"



A Redditor on an H-1B visa claimed that her passport was stamped 'cancelled and withdrawn' at Abu Dhabi preclearance as she was traveling back to the US in January, along with her husband. Explaining her case, she said that she traveled to India in November to celebrate her daughter's first birthday and did not face the H-1B stamping delay as their appointment dates were before December 15, 2025 -- before the visa chaos started.The Redditor said her husband and she got their visa stamping o December 12 before dates started to get rescheduled en masse. Their ticket to the US was in January and as they reached the Abu Dhabi preclearance, her case was flagged. Her husband was cleared with no issue.The woman narrated the questions she was asked at the preclearance and the possible reason why she was not allowed to travel further to the US.The woman was asked how long she stayed in India and whether she was working from India or not. The Redditor said she stayed in India for two months and it was a combination of work and vacation. She was on paid time off but she partially worked.She was sent for a secondary inspection, where she was asked to show proof that working from India was mentioned in her Labor Condition Application which was not there.The woman was told that she 'overstayed' in India and getting paid while working from India for a US company is against US law.""They cancelled my visa and stamped 'Cancelled and Withdrawn' on my passport. I was told that I would need to go for visa stamping again. However, there are currently no visa appointment slots available,"" the woman wrote.""My company’s immigration attorney says there is no such rule that prohibits working remotely from India while employed by a US company, and has advised me to go for stamping again. But with no available slots, I’m extremely stressed and unsure what to do next,"" the woman wrote, seeking advice.Hundreds of H-1B workers got stranded in India after the State Department started social media vetting since December 2025, resulting in a massive rescheduling of visa appointments. Those who had appointment dates in December got rescheduled to April or May 2026. Subsequently, all dates went haywire and now there is no dates for visa stamping in consular offices in 2026.While some companies allowed Indian H-1Bs to work remotely from India as long as they are stuck in their home country, the legal part of it remains a grey area for most of the companies and the employees.","A redditor on an h-1b visa claimed that her passport was stamped 'cancelled and withdrawn' at abu dhabi preclearance.

A total of 1,575 security flaws detected

How the flaws are misused

Limited updates raise concerns

Android users, beware! Several popular mental health apps with around 14.7 million downloads on Google Play Store may be putting your data at risk. According to research by Oversecured (via Bleeping Computer), multiple mental health apps, including AI-based therapy chatbots, contain vulnerabilities that are capable of exposing private therapy conversations, mood logs and medical details. In one case, researchers found more than 85 medium- and high-risk security flaws in a single app. As per the report, some of these apps – with millions of downloads globally – claim to offer privacy and encryption on the vendor’s servers. “Mental health data carries unique risks. On the dark web, therapy records sell for $1,000 or more per record, far more than credit card numbers,” says Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile security company Oversecured.In its research, Oversecured scanned ten mobile apps advertised as tools that can help with various mental health problems. During the research, the organisation uncovered a total of 1,575 security vulnerabilities (54 rated high-severity, 538 medium-severity, and 983 low-severity). Though not critical, these vulnerabilities can be exploited to intercept login credentials, spoof notifications, HTML injection, or to locate the user.“These apps collect and store some of the most sensitive personal data in mobile: therapy session transcripts, mood logs, medication schedules, self-harm indicators, and in some cases, information protected under HIPAA,” the researchers note.According to the report, some apps improperly handle links and commands from outside sources. This could allow attackers to access internal parts of the app that are not meant to be exposed, including areas that handle login tokens or session data. In simple terms, a hacker could trick an app into opening protected sections and gain access to therapy records.One therapy app with over a million downloads allegedly uses Intent.parseUri() on an externally controlled string and launches the resulting messaging object (intent) without validating the target component. This allows an attacker to force the app to open any internal activity, even if it is not intended for external access.“Since these internal activities often handle authentication tokens and session data, exploitation could give an attacker access to a user’s therapy records,” Oversecured research says.Other apps were found storing sensitive information locally in ways that any app on the phone could read. This could expose CBT session notes, mood scores, and personal journal entries. Researchers also found unprotected configuration data, such as backend server addresses, and the use of weak random number generators for security keys.Many of the apps also lack basic protections like root detection, the research found. This means that on a rooted phone, other apps could freely access stored health data.In its research, Oversecured also noted that most of these apps still had medium-level problems that weaken overall security. Only four of the 10 apps had been updated recently, while others had not seen updates since late 2025 or even 2024.The scans were carried out in late January 2026, and researchers said they could not confirm whether the issues have since been fixed.","Mental health apps with 14.7 million downloads on google play store may be putting your data at risk.

Antonela Roccuzzo Net Worth in 2026: Inside Lionel Messi’s wife’s rise from Rosario to global influencer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/antonela-roccuzzo-net-worth-in-2026-inside-lionel-messis-wifes-rise-from-rosario-to-global-influencer/articleshow/128766171.cms,"Antonela Roccuzzo, Lionel Messi’s wife, has built an estimated $20 million net worth through modeling, brand partnerships, and social media influence. Born in Rosario, she grew from a private figure into a global lifestyle icon. With major fashion collaborations, philanthropic work, and over 40 million followers, she balances family life with business success and international recognition.

What is Antonela Roccuzzo's net worth?

From Rosario roots to global recognition

Creating a brand outside football popularity

Antonela Roccuzzo has established a worldwide reputation extended way beyond the fact that she is the partner of Lionel Messi. She has built power in fashion, charitable work and a strong social media presence since Rosario to the global platform. Counting millions of fans who follow her fashion, family life, and philanthropic activities, Roccuzzo is an example of her celebrity and purpose that are so modern that they cross the space and reach another continent.Although it was her association with the football icon that most people initially learned about her, her own business identity has blossomed itself into a brand that is distinct and commercially promising. The experience of modelling partnerships, ambassador activities, and even entrepreneurial projects has further advanced her persona, contributing to her becoming one of the most well-known personalities associated with the football segment of world culture.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Antonela Roccuzzo's estimated net worth of $20 million reflects years of brand collaborations, endorsements, and business ventures.But her success is culturally relevant, too. She is a new generation of sports-related publicity figures who influence the tone of the discourse on family, charity, and fashion.Nevertheless, high-profile relationships are still obscuring the fences between sport and celebrity culture. Such athletes as NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs exemplify how nowadays athletes enjoy the same globally facing coverage, connecting entertainment, fashion, and social media followings.Antonela Roccuzzo has established a distinctive position that has been earned through thoughtful branding and genuine storytelling. She is not only family, but she is global, and this fact proves that she can make a great impact even outside the football ferrele.Roccuzzo was born in the family of Italian ancestry in the town of Rosario, Argentina, on February 26, 1988. She spent a short while in dentistry studies at the National University of Rosario but she shifted to social communication, which would be a clue to her future in a position close to the people. Her relationship with Lionel Messi goes way back to childhood and was originally introduced by her cousin Lucas Scaglia. Several years down the road, they fell in love and made their relationship official in 2009.In 2017, the couple got married in a grand wedding at Rosario in the presence of football greats and celebrities. They have three sons together and spend their time in Argentina, Spain, and the United States. On several occasions, Roccuzzo appears alongside Messi at important matches, such as the successful World Cup of Argentina in 2022.Roccuzzo has worked as a model with leading fashion designers and starting up in retail. She was signed by Argentine footwear brand Ricky Sarkany and she opened a boutique in Barcelona. Her style and presence in fashion and lifestyle can be viewed through the nature of her relationships with such global brands as Adidas and Stella McCartney.Her personal connection appeals to the audience, and as a style icon and a family member to be emulated and liked simultaneously she has over 40 million Instagram followers. This online presence has helped her in her cooperation with various humanitarian organizations like the UNICEF and Special Olympics, which have some more contribution to her commitment towards social causes.","Antonela roccuzzo has built an estimated $20 million net worth through modeling, brand partnerships, and social media influence.

Anthropic Accuses 3 Chinese Companies of Harvesting Its Data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anthropic-accuses-3-chinese-companies-of-harvesting-its-data/articleshow/128762822.cms,"Anthropic’s terms forbid anyone to harvest data for distillation. Separately, over not sharing its technology with Pentagon, the company’s CEO Dario Amodei (inset) has made clear his ethical concerns about unchecked govt use of AI





SAN FRANCISCO: The San Francisco artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has accused three Chinese companies of improperly harvesting large amounts of data from its AI technologies in an effort to accelerate the development of their own systems.Anthropic said in a blog post Monday that DeepSeek, Moonshot and MiniMax -- three prominent Chinese startups -- used about 24,000 fraudulent accounts to generate more than 16 million conversations with its Claude chatbot that could be used to teach skills to their own chatbots.Using data from one AI system to train another -- a process called distillation -- is common in AI work. But Anthropic's terms of service forbid anyone to surreptitiously harvest data for distillation and do not allow its technologies to be used in China.OpenAI, Anthropic's primary rival, has also accused Chinese companies of lifting large amounts of data from its chatbot, ChatGPT, for similar proposes.In a memo sent to the House Select Committee on China last week, OpenAI said that DeepSeek and other Chinese startups were using new and ""obfuscated"" distillation methods as part of their ""ongoing efforts to free-ride"" on technologies developed by OpenAI and other U.S.companies.Like OpenAI, Anthropic said the practice was a national security risk, adding that it could allow China to build AI technologies to create bioweapons or tools for mass surveillance. The startup has guardrails on its technologies designed to prevent them from being used in those ways, but the guardrails can be stripped away during distillation.Anthropic called on government officials and other AI companies to help prevent Chinese companies from distilling American models.""These campaigns are growing in intensity and sophistication,"" Anthropic said in its post. ""The window to act is narrow, and the threat extends beyond any single company or region. Addressing it will require rapid, coordinated action among industry players, policymakers and the global AI community.""DeepSeek, Moonshot and MiniMax did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Anthropic published its post amid a tussle with the Defense Department over the Pentagon's use of its technologies. The Pentagon has approved Anthropic's technologies for use with classified tasks, but it is threatening to sever ties with the startup because Anthropic does not want its technologies used in situations involving autonomous weapons or domestic surveillance.Last year, DeepSeek spooked Silicon Valley tech companies and sent the U.S. financial markets into a tailspin after releasing AI technologies that matched the performance of anything else on the market.Until then, the prevailing wisdom in Silicon Valley had been that the most powerful systems could not be built without billions of dollars in specialized computer chips. But DeepSeek said it had created its technologies using far fewer resources.Like U.S. companies, DeepSeek, Moonshot and MiniMax build their AI technologies using computer code and data corralled from across the internet. AI companies around the world lean heavily on a practice called open sourcing, which means they freely share the code that underpins their technologies and reuse code shared by others. They see this as a way of accelerating technological development.AI companies also need enormous amounts of online data to train their AI systems. The leading systems learn their skills by analyzing just about all of the text on the internet.Distillation is often used to train new systems. This is often allowed by open source technologies. But if a company takes data from proprietary technology, the practice may be legally problematic.Anthropic, which is now valued at $380 billion, is facing multiple lawsuits accusing it of illegally using copyrighted internet data to train its systems. In September as part of a landmark legal settlement, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a group of authors and publishers after a judge ruled it had illegally downloaded and stored millions of copyrighted books. It was the largest payout in the history of U.S. copyright cases.OpenAI and other AI companies face similar suits, including a lawsuit brought by The New York Times against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. That suit contends that millions of articles published by the Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information. Both OpenAI and Microsoft deny the claims.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.","San francisco ai startup anthropic accuses three chinese companies of improperly harvesting large amounts of data from its ai technologies.

The unconscious soundtrack of the doomscroll generation? It's phonk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/the-unconscious-soundtrack-of-the-doomscroll-generation-its-phonk/articleshow/128763387.cms,"



In the last month, the music artist with the largest audience across YouTube platforms wasn't Bad Bunny or Taylor Swift. It was Slxughter, a phonk producer. The term probably doesn't sound familiar, but anyone who's spent any time on social media has almost certainly listened to it.Maybe it's better to say ""heard it,"" since the overwhelming majority of people who consume phonk don't recognise it as a genre, let alone actively choose it. But it's constantly playing in the background during YouTube Shorts, TikTok or Instagram Reels. It can sound like electronic dance music, but also hip-hop, trap, funk or a mix of those. It can accompany dance clips, gaming montages, fan edits, workout content, sports highlights, motivational clips and anything aiming to convey high-energy vibes.Quietly making its way as the most popular music on vertical videos, phonk has become the unconscious soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online. And it has earned a fortune for its producers, often teenagers who can create a viral track from their bedrooms and become millionaires through royalties within a matter of months.""I've been waiting for this conversation for the past, like, five years,"" Kevin Meenan, 43, music trends manager at YouTube, said as an opening statement in a call.The reason someone like Slxughter has such a huge following on YouTube, Meenan explained, is that the monthly audience is calculated by combining ""classic"" YouTube views with the listenership on all YouTube platforms, including Shorts. This month, Slxughter's music reached 981 million unique users, more than twice Taylor Swift's (394 million) and more than six times Bad Bunny's (150 million).""Phonk is a sleeping giant,"" Josh Mateer, 34, head of A&R at SoundOn, TikTok's distribution platform for artists and labels, said in a phone interview. ""There is a huge juxtaposition between the volume of internet traffic around phonk and the sort of culture as an underground musical movement.""The roots of the genre date back to the Memphis, Tennessee, rap scene of the late '80s and '90s, when producers like Tommy Wright III and Three 6 Mafia began defining a raw, sinister sound marked by heavy bass, eerie lyrics, cowbells and hypnotic loops.By the end of the 2010s, Russian and Eastern European producers entered the scene. Tyler Blatchley, 41, co-founder of the phonk label Black 17 Media, was working at Sony at the time. In Dec2020, he heard an obscure track by Russian producer Kaito Shoma on TikTok and recognised some Three 6 Mafia lyrics. He contacted the group's DJ Paul and cleared the song for monetisation. It was the beginning of what is called drift phonk (from its use in clips of drifting cars) and the genre's explosion on social platforms.Today, Blatchley lives in a villa with a pool and basketball court one hour's drive from Miami. ""We don't even know how to pronounce half of them,"" he said. ""These kids are producers that work out of their bedroom from all over the world, and they're watching the algorithm to see what's popular on vertical video, and then they're adjusting the kind of music that they make accordingly.""The latest iteration of phonk is so-called Brazilian phonk. Initially dubbed Automotivo phonk, it got confused with Brazilian ""funk,"" an older genre with authentic Brazilian roots. It is this branch of phonk - more aggressive than drift, but in some cases more danceable - that pushed Slxughter to the top of the charts.","Phonk has become the soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online.

Uae Pharmaceutical Monopoly Reform: UAE announces new pharmaceutical rule to break medicine monopolies and lower drug costs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-announces-new-pharmaceutical-rule-to-break-medicine-monopolies-and-lower-drug-costs/articleshow/128750605.cms,"UAE enhances drug security with competition-driven pharmaceutical distribution reform / Image: file

UAE's new medical protocols for 2026

What does the new mechanism mean?

Encouraging competition UAE's pharmaceuticals

Improving market stability





Finding essential medication just got easier, and likely more affordable, for UAE residents. On Tuesday, February 24, 2026, the Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) activated a historic mechanism designed to dismantle the long-standing ""single-agent"" monopoly over medical products.For decades, exclusive distributors controlled many life-saving drugs, but that era is ending. This new rule directly responds to strategic priorities aimed at securing the nation's pharmaceutical supply while making healthcare more competitive and patient-centered.The United Arab Emirates has introduced a first-of-its-kind rule aimed at breaking monopolies in the pharmaceutical sector and strengthening medicine availability nationwide.Announced by the Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE), the new framework requires drugmakers to register multiple authorised agents for each medicine they market in the UAE, a departure from the previous single-agent model that often limited supply options.This change is part of the Federal Decree-Law No. (38) of 2024 Governing Medical Products, Pharmacists and Pharmaceutical Establishments, designed to improve the resilience and competitiveness of the healthcare sector.Under the old model, a single distributor handled imports, distribution and supply of a medicine type. This could sometimes slow delivery, reduce flexibility in response to sudden demand spikes or supply chain disruptions, and create conditions for monopolistic control. The new rule is expected to mitigate these risks by broadening choice and competition among authorised agents.The reform's core goal is to ensure the continuous availability of medical products across all emirates. By authorizing more than one agent per product, the UAE aims to make it easier for pharmacies, hospitals and patients to access a wider range of medicines without delays.Officials say this will enhance supply chain flexibility, allowing faster responses when demand rises suddenly, such as during public health emergencies, and reducing the chance of shortages. The mechanism also aims to boost distribution efficiency across the UAE by improving inventory management and speeding delivery times.This means that if one supplier faces operational, logistical or unexpected challenges, others can step in to keep supply lines steady. Enhancing distribution networks is expected to benefit healthcare providers and patients alike, especially in remote or high-demand areas.Officials from the EDE have linked the reform to broader economic and investment strategies. By opening the market to multiple authorised agents per product, the UAE is encouraging fair competition and diversity in distribution channels. This is seen as attractive for international pharmaceutical companies looking to invest or expand their footprint in the Middle East.According to Saeed bin Mubarak Al Hajeri, Minister of State and Chairman of EDE’s Board, the move aligns with national priorities to strengthen pharmaceutical infrastructure, enhance regulatory efficiency and support a robust healthcare ecosystem.He emphasised that pharmaceutical investment is one of the UAE’s economic strengths, and modernising the market framework boosts the country’s global competitiveness.Fatima Al Kaabi, Director General of the Emirates Drug Establishment, highlighted that beyond supply continuity, the reform will support market stability and sustainability by aligning local practices with international best standards. She noted that the UAE is well positioned to attract more pharmaceutical industries, drive research and development, and strengthen its role as a regional hub for medicine manufacturing and innovation.The EDE’s broader strategic efforts also focus on enhancing storage, quality control, transportation standards and regulatory oversight, all aimed at preparing the healthcare sector to respond better to both routine demand and extraordinary health challenges.","Uae enhances drug security with competition-driven pharmaceutical distribution reform.
