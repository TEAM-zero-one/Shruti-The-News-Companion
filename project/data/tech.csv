'False' toll fee deduction? NHAI cracks the whip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/false-toll-fee-deduction-nhai-cracks-the-whip/articleshow/118668029.cms,"NEW DELHI: Have you ever received a toll deduction message from your FASTag wallet even though your car was parked or you hadn't passed through a toll plaza? Officials explain that this can occur when toll operators mistakenly enter the vehicle number, often due to issues with the FASTag being unreadable for various reasons, or when people carry tags in their wallets.Cracking down on such instances of ""false"" deductions from FASTag wallet, the NHAI has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases. For each violation, the highways authority's toll management entity, IHMCL, has started imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh.Due to this high penalty, the number of such cases has reduced by almost 70% and now 50 such genuine complaints reach IHMCL in a month while nearly 30 crore FASTag transactions happen at all plazas on the national highway network.Many users have taken to social media to highlight instances of false toll deductions from their FASTag wallets, in addition to lodging complaints with IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.He said, the main reason for such false deductions is entry of incorrect vehicle numbers by toll operators while processing electronic transactions manually.","Nhai has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases of ""false"" deductions.

ISRO to resume SpaDeX experiments from March 15: V Narayanan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-resume-spadex-experiments-from-march-15-v-narayanan/articleshow/118625225.cms,"ISRO Chairman V Narayanan

NEW DELHI: The ISRO will resume experiments on the SpaDeX mission in mid-March by trying to separate the two satellites – Chaser and Target – and re-dock them again as it attempts to master the technologies for future projects. The SpaDeX mission was launched on December 30 last year when it placed in orbit two satellites – SDX01 and SDX02 – to demonstrate the docking experiment in space. After several attempts, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was successful in docking the two satellites on January 16.""Currently, the unified satellite is in an elliptical orbit. So, we get a 10-15 days window once in two months to conduct various experiments,"" ISRO Chairman V Narayanan told PTI on the sidelines of the National Science Day celebrations here.He said the window for carrying out experiments on the SpaDeX satellites will be available from March 15.""Right now, we are doing simulation experiments for separation of satellites and re-docking them. We have charted out a plan and will start the actual experiments from March 15,"" Narayanan said.Ahead of the mission's launch, the ISRO had said after successful docking and rigidization, it planned to demonstrate electrical power transfer between the two satellites before undocking and separation.""We want to do multiple experiments. There is a lot of propellant onboard. We also have experiments lined up for the third slot that would be available after two months,"" Narayanan said.He said the SpaDeX mission is a fore-runner for several future projects such as the Chandrayaan-4, building of the Bharat Antariksha Station which will involve use of docking technologies.Earlier, Union Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh flagged off the e-Tractor and e-Tiller developed by CSIR-Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur.","The spadex mission was launched on december 30 last year.

“He can't take it anymore”: Tom Brady reportedly fed up with Gisele Bündchen and seeks emotional and physical distance for a fresh start,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-cant-take-it-anymore-tom-brady-reportedly-fed-up-with-gisele-bndchen-and-seeks-emotional-and-physical-distance-for-a-fresh-start/articleshow/118657321.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen

Tom Brady is making a big transition in his life as he gets set to sell his $150 million Miami estate, a home where he previously lived with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. Sources indicate that the sale comes from the emotional pain of watching Bündchen progress with her new life and her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn baby. While Brady has kept his eye on his post-NFL business, the fact that his ex-wife is moving on to a new chapter has reportedly not been easy for him.Sources indicate that 47-year-old ex-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance between himself and the lingering reminders of his past. While he continues with his work and self-development, the harsh fact of remaining unmarried for close to three years with his former spouse, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, having reestablished life with her lover, Joaquim Valente, has purportedly been challenging. Unloading his $150 million Miami villa seems a part of wrapping that chapter up and opening doors to a new life.Brady and Bündchen, who share their two children, divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2022. Although they remain on good terms for the benefit of their family, the fact that their homes are in close proximity has not allowed Brady to completely move on.The supermodel and her new beau, a jiu-jitsu instructor, now share a lavish waterfront home just across from Brady's compound—a home that was originally part of the ex-couple's future together. Far from representing their aspirations, however, it now serves as a bitter reminder of what he stands to lose.For Brady, the sale of the mansion can be more than a money matter, but a heart matter as well. Leaving a city full of reminders of his own marriage may grant him the time he requires to work on being happy himself and potentially even opening himself to finding another relationship.Though he still hasn't commented publicly on his motivation for selling, those in his inner circle say the switch is about something greater than a piece of property—it's about reclaiming his sense of mind and looking to the future stage of his life.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told radaronline.com. ""He sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down. He can't take it anymore. He wants to sell the house. It reminds him of Gisele. She was the one who dominated the remodeling, and it's her style, her personal touches. He still feels her nuance everywhere.”Also Read: “I’m pretty disappointed”: Rob Gronkowski feels overlooked as Tom Brady makes Raiders moves without considering him Tom Brady has no plans to leave Miami, the city he moved to in 2019 when he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he is looking to downsize and find a more private residence that allows him to step away from the memories tied to his current home.Despite wanting a fresh start, Brady remains dedicated to co-parenting his two children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. His goal is to create a peaceful and comfortable environment where he can focus on his personal well-being while staying actively involved in his children's lives.","Tom brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from gisele bündchen.

"Elon Musk's internet: So based, much wow. So cringe?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-internet-so-based-much-wow-so-cringe/articleshow/118668256.cms,"Elon Musk

SAN FRANCISCO: In 2010, a woman in Sakura, Japan, posted photos of her well-manicured Shiba Inu to her digital journal. The dog, Kabosu , shot her owner a wide-eyed glance, a comic image that quickly jumped from Tumblr to Twitter to Facebook and to the rest of the internet.A meme legend was born. Someone on Reddit called the dog ""DOGE,"" a nonsensical nickname that stuck. Another minted a cryptocurrency in DOGE's name.Now, 15 years later, in the fast churn of internet culture, DOGE is considered very old. But try telling that to Elon Musk , who has co-opted ""DOGE"" for the name of his effort to gut the machinery of the federal government -- more formally, the Department of Government Efficiency.It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. A brief scroll through Musk's X feed reveals a menagerie of aging memes and lingo -- dad jokes for the very online. They include:-- Frequent references to ""420,"" a half-century-old slang term for smoking marijuana said to have started in a high school in Northern California. (After smoking what looked like a blunt live on the Joe Rogan podcast, Musk briefly changed his Twitter bio to ""420."")-- Regularly including the number ""69,"" a slang term for a sex act that has been around since at least the Kama Sutra. (Musk, who is 53 years old, is quick to point out that his birthday falls 69 days after 4/20.)-- Calling things that he supports ""epic"" or ""based."" These are adjectives favored by frequent users of Reddit and popularized by fans of Joss Whedon, a director who created the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer "" television series in the late 1990s and went on to direct two of the Avengers movies. (Musk has said he wants to create ""based"" artificial intelligence with his chatbot, Grok, and recently told Tesla investors he expected an ""epic"" 2026 ahead for the company.)Musk's slang may seem inscrutable to people who aren't steeped in online culture. But to his fans, Musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food -- and a nod to a shared, aggrieved worldview.Musk's posts are full of the language of warfare and conquest portrayed in video games. That loaded language is a rallying cry for gamers and others from Musk's very online world who -- if they have a common political ideology -- see in him someone who shares their skepticism of authority and their belief that America has gone too ""woke."" To them, Musk's online updates about what DOGE is up to come across as far more honest than a press release or news conference or -- worst of all -- something they read in the mainstream media. (It's a strategy that recalls Donald Trump's use of Twitter to signal authenticity during his first administration.)""We're living in the revenge of the nerds era,"" Hasan Piker, a popular, politically progressive online personality who is not a fan of Musk, said in an interview. ""This is the real, actual revenge of the nerds.""Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Every photo of Musk wielding a chain saw while wearing ""deal with it"" sunglasses indoors (another meme) represents a triumph of the nerd culture he has long identified with. On Wednesday, he attended the first meeting of President Donald Trump's new Cabinet wearing a T-shirt that said ""Tech Support.""His fans speak back to him in his language. They send suggestions on how DOGE can fix the government by dismantling entire sections of it, often coded in the language of images typically found on Reddit. (Wojak, a crudely drawn character popularized on message board 4chan, is a perennial favorite.)Musk prods his more than 200 million X followers for help with decisions in online polls. And he listens. The conversation becomes a feedback loop of insider jokes for the billionaire, who once hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and prides himself on his sense of humor.""Anyone can find their own community, even if it's a community frozen in 2010,"" Brian Feldman, an internet culture writer who has long followed Musk's exploits, said in an interview.But to those steeped in modern internet culture, Musk's communication style is far from on trend. That is especially so when even current terms like ""no cap"" (translation: no lie) or ""lowkey fell off"" (waned in popularity or relevance) are already showing their age. As with recent questions about Musk's claims of superior video game skills, they see cracks in his supernerd facade.""More than people would like to admit, they often become trapped in the internet they first encounter,"" Feldman said.Last week, Musk appeared at a conservative political conference wearing dark sunglasses, a big gold chain and a T-shirt that said he was ""not procrastinating"" but instead working on ""side quests"" (a common practice in sprawling role-playing games). He played off the quote from Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita that Robert Oppenheimer said was going through his mind as he tested the first atomic bomb: ""Now, I am become Death. The destroyer of worlds.""""I am become meme,"" Musk said to a mostly mute crowd. ""There's living the dream, and there's living the meme, and that's pretty much what's happening.""Even some of his most fervent followers on X recoiled. ""Elon Musk fell off lowkey,"" one user wrote.Musk's online vocabulary is a reminder of 2010, when nerd culture was ascendant. Reddit was a meme factory for favorites like Lolcats and icanhazcheeseburger. Gamers gathered in web forums or on online role-playing games to hang out and fight through digital dungeons.This was also the beginning of Musk's metamorphosis from mere billionaire to internet celebrity. That year, he appeared as himself in the second ""Iron Man"" film. His online fans ate it up.All of this also coincided with the rise of Web 2.0, a more social version of the internet. Twitter -- long before Musk bought it and renamed it -- was a town square. Facebook moved beyond likes and status updates with "" Groups ,"" a feature that allowed people to form their own smaller communities. Chat forum 4chan was full of anonymous, often angry online trolls who bonded over vulgar behavior.While online groups had existed for years, the newer social networks were more tightly knit and rewarded the behavior that Musk often displays today. The right kind of posts could pick up steam and shoot across the internet.Provocateurs moved beyond small-scale trolling to aggressive mass movements, such as Gamergate, a targeted harassment campaign against a female game designer by video game players who claimed she represented a lack of ethics in games journalism. It morphed into a social movement that fought diversity, feminism and what gamers saw as overly progressive values in film, television, literature and the video game industry -- a viewpoint that Musk shares.Gamergate also signaled that digital demonstrations could, for better or worse, lead to real-world change.Musk's tweeting style changed from anodyne company updates to more overt trolling. In 2018, he tweeted that he had secured a buyout offer for Tesla for a stock price of $420. Once, when a competing car company tried undercutting him on price, Musk said that he would drop the cost of his Tesla Model X to $69,420.""The gauntlet has been thrown down!"" he proclaimed on Twitter. ""The prophecy has been fulfilled.""Unlike other tech billionaires, who seemed to live lives far removed from regular internet folk and became less online the richer they got, Musk was making himself relatable with memes, absurdity and relentless posting. And parts of the online world embraced him.""Many people find him off-putting, I think,"" coldhealing, a pseudonymous cultural commentator who regularly follows Musk and other social movements online, said in an interview. ""But there are many people who he resonates with, and even though I think it's 10% of the population max, it's an influential 10%.""Musk's online life became even more bombastic after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. He attacked Tesla short-sellers and California state officials who wouldn't let him reopen a Tesla factory. In 2023, he even live-tweeted photos of himself driving to Mark Zuckerberg's house, threatening to wrestle the CEO of Facebook. (They were, at the time, in the throes of organizing a real fighting match between them. It never happened.)He posted himself playing video games such as Elden Ring, Path of Exile and Diablo IV. One of the world's wealthiest men was telling gamers that he was one of them.Mark Kern, a former video game executive at Blizzard, wrote in a post to X in February that people should not mess with gamers. ""We're forged by endless boss battles against impossible odds. We do not give up. We do not stop. We are the terminators of the culture war.""""Yes,"" Musk wrote, quoting the post.Conservatives who don't spend a lot of time online have also embraced the image of Musk taking a chain saw to what they see as a bloated federal government, even if many of them aren't exactly sure what he's trying to say or when they're supposed to laugh.""It's validation from people who have no idea what he's saying but still think he's speaking this expert language,"" said Feldman, the internet culture writer.But Musk may be finding his online limits. It was difficult for some of his followers to shake off his stage appearance in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which reminded them that it is hard to stay cool when you are, in fact, not very young. (Kabosu did not live to see the meme she inspired enter American political life. The 18-year-old Shiba Inu died last year.)""Anyone else feel the vibe-shift in tpot/tech?"" one X user wrote, referring to an online community called ""This Part of Twitter,"" which is largely composed of tech workers who have historically warmed to Musk. In other words, Musk was starting to look a little out of touch and increasingly unpopular.Nonetheless, Musk seems to be doubling down. His posting to X has increased in recent weeks, some days numbering in the hundreds.And he is still being validated by his fans.On Thursday, Musk posted another meme to his X account -- one of dozens of posts he had made that morning. In it was a photo of Mel Gibson as Mad Max in ""The Road Warrior,"" the early 1980s action thriller about a shotgun-toting nomad navigating a postapocalyptic world. In bold lettering, the meme said: ""Ladies, it's time to start thinking whether the guy you're dating has postapocalyptic warlord potential."" (Film buffs may note that Max's wife and son were killed by a biker gang in the first ""Mad Max"" film.)One follower replied with a photo of a man wearing a Trojan helmet and body armor with an assault rifle in one hand and a spear in the other. It was one of more than 7,000 replies.""Yup,"" the follower said, adding a fire emoji.","Elon musk has co-opted ""doge"" for the name of his effort to gut the federal government. It is one of dozens of old-internet ephemera that are baked into his everyday vocabulary. To his fans, musk's dated sensibilities are a kind of internet comfort food. Musk's online vocabulary is a reminder of 2010, when nerd culture was ascendant.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118668276,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31866,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Building a brand, one store at a time

Surviving the gymwear wars

From a grandmother’s sewing machine to a billion-dollar empire

At just 28, Ben Francis became Britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, Gymshark , skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation. Now, at 32, he’s setting his sights on an even bigger conquest—New York City.Later this year, Francis will open a sprawling 13,000-square-foot Gymshark store on Bond Street, a move he sees as crucial to the brand’s global success, reported the New York Post.“I love New York … It’s the perfect place for Gymshark, and I’m honored to call it our North American home,” he told me. “We have to be successful in the US in order for us to be successful around the world.”Francis built Gymshark online in 2012, capitalizing on the rise of fitness influencers and the e-commerce boom. But now, he believes physical stores are just as important as a brand’s digital presence.His first retail venture came in 2022 with a flagship store on London’s Regent Street. Dubai followed, and in late 2024, a Gymshark pop-up landed on Wooster Street in SoHo. That temporary store’s success gave Francis the confidence to commit to a permanent NYC presence.“The city has been so supportive of our brand vision,” he said. “People can finally see and feel the product we’re so proud of … I think physical brick-and-mortar stores are actually sort of a new and different way for us to reach people.”Unlike traditional athletic apparel stores, Gymshark’s locations are designed as community hubs , featuring workout spaces, personal training sessions, and room for fitness events.The $25 billion gymwear market is fiercely competitive. While brands like Outdoor Voices and Olympia Sports have folded, giants like Nike and Lululemon battle newer players like Alo Yoga and Vuori for dominance. Gymshark, however, has carved out a loyal following with its sleek, performance-driven designs and strong influencer network.Francis credits Gymshark’s staying power to its community—one he built from scratch by sending free products to fitness YouTubers long before influencer marketing was mainstream.“When I was getting into the gym, all the people I learned the most from were online on YouTube,” he said. “When Gymshark started, we ended up sending product to a few of my heroes at the time.”Some of those influencers even received equity in the company, aligning their success with Gymshark’s meteoric rise.Francis, who grew up in England’s West Midlands, wasn’t an overnight success. He dabbled in multiple business ventures as a teen, many of which flopped. But when he started Gymshark, he had a clear vision: create gym clothes that were breathable, sweat-wicking, and odor-resistant.He learned to sew from his grandmother and stitched early orders himself. The brand’s rapid success was fueled by both its quality and Francis’ transparency—he let customers see behind the scenes of the business, building trust and loyalty.“People nowadays are interested in the story behind a brand,” he said. “They want to know who’s behind the scenes, who’s running it, and what the story is.”Now, as he brings Gymshark to the heart of New York, Francis is betting big on a future where fitness isn’t just about working out—it’s about belonging.","At just 28, ben francis became britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, gymshark, skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation.

Carl Feynman: 'I'm outdone in minutes': Computer engineer says AI has surpassed years of his work in a flash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-outdone-in-minutes-computer-engineer-says-ai-has-surpassed-years-of-his-work-in-a-flash/articleshow/118596710.cms,"Carl Feynman

Who is Carl Feynman?

Carl Feynman , son of American theoretical physicist Richard Feynman , pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at MIT in 1986. He found AI's rapid progress both fascinating and worrying. After seeing an AI create a cloth animation in minutes, he shared his thoughts on X, noting how quickly artificial intelligence is outpacing human effort.“I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?” Feynman posted, acknowledging how quickly AI models are mastering complex simulations that once required months of research and powerful computers.The conversation began when an X user shared their experience with Sonnet 3.7, an AI model with reasoning capabilities, which successfully generated an intricate cloth simulation in p5.js—a task that had stumped other leading AI models, including Grok 3 and o1 Pro.""Can you write the most intricate cloth simulation in p5js,"" was the prompt put by the X user.Recognizing the significance of this breakthrough, the user said: “Wow, Sonnet 3.7 w/ Thinking just solved a problem no other model could solve yet.”The reaction by Feynman to the simulation quickly gained traction, with the user pointing out Feynman’s legacy: “The man who literally invented modeling cloth in computer graphics at MIT in 1986 saw the video where Claude creates a cloth animation and says: ‘I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes. They still pay me, but for how long?’”Carl Feynman, the son of renowned physicist Richard Feynman, made significant contributions to computer graphics by developing early methods for simulating cloth movement. His work laid the groundwork for realistic fabric simulations used in films, video games, and virtual reality. In 1986, his master’s thesis, “Modeling the Appearance of Cloth,” was a pioneering achievement in the field.Reflecting on that time, Feynman noted: “It took library research and cleverness and originality and months of work and days of time on big computers. Now I’m outdone by an AI in a few minutes.”While AI continues to break barriers in computational creativity, Feynman’s words highlight an underlying concern: the speed at which AI is advancing, raising questions about the future of human expertise in fields that once relied on deep technical skill and years of experience.","Carl feynman, son of physicist richard feyn man, pioneered cloth simulation in computer graphics at mit in 1986.

Various technological approaches are being explored globally to create a transportation system featuring capsules supported by air-bearing surfaces within low-pressure tubes.The 422-metre vacuum tube testing facility was established through a collaborative effort between Indian Railways, L&T Constructions and Avishkar Hyperloop at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.TuTr Hyperloop, a deep-tech venture incubated at IIT Madras, conducted India's first commercial intent hyperloop pod run on Monday. The firm has been working alongside Indian Railways to advance this technology. Additionally, an official statement indicated that Indian Railways and IIT Madras will collaborate on developing a vertical take-off landing vehicle, with funding from Indian Railways.The potential for hyperloop technology in India is substantial. As Denis Tudor, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-founder at Swisspod Technologies said, ""India has a great potential for hyperloop. It is estimated that a 40-kilometre test track would cost $150 -300 million upon completion depending on the dimension for the project.""A significant collaboration emerged when Tudor's Swiss-American enterprise and TuTr from India entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in March 2022.

"Health premiums surge, some renewals take a hit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-premiums-surge-some-renewals-take-a-hit/articleshow/118669212.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Health insurance premium costs have surged forcing some policyholders to either downgrade or drop out of their cover. 1 in 10 policyholders has missed out on renewals in this financial year. About 10% policyholders have seen their renewal costs rise by 30% or more this year - only half of them paid the full premium.Why are premiums soaring? Insurers say a worsening claims ratio (the percentage of claims to total premium collected) is behind the hikes.The reason why a section of policyholders see sharp hikes is that health premiums do not rise in a steady, predictable manner but tend to jump at intervals. Insurers typically adjust their rate schedules every three years to account for medical inflation - the rising cost of treatments. Premiums also increase with age, with sharper hikes in later years reflecting higher claims in older age groups.Over the last 10 years, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in premiums ranged between 5-10% for 52% of policyholders. This means that for more than half of them, a Rs 100 premium increased to Rs 162-259 after 10 years.For another 38%, CAGR in premiums ranged from 10-15%, translating to their Rs 100 premium rising to Rs 259-404 over the same period. However, 3% of policyholders saw their premiums rise with a CAGR of 15-30%.""The percentage of people who saw a very large price increase is very small. You have to look at what is happening in the context of medical inflation, which is close to 14%, while the average increase in premiums is much lower,"" said Amit Chhabra, chief business officer general insurance at Policybazaar. He adds that the 90% renewal is a 10% improvement from the previous year and the renewal ratio is trending upwards.A study by Policybazaar provides insights into India's evolving health insurance market, highlighting rising premiums, consumer strategies to mitigate costs, and the industry's response to increasing medical inflation. While some policyholders face sharp premium hikes, most are finding ways to manage expenses through new plan structures and cost-saving measures.""If there is a price increase, and I don't want to absorb that increase, then as a customer, I have the option to move to a slightly lower variant, which brings down the premium. Many people are also opting for deductibles when renewing their policies to reduce costs,"" said Chhabra. Besides medical inflation, and emergence of new tech, there is also widening of the scope of cover in health insurance.",About 10% policyholders have seen their renewal costs rise by 30% or more this year. 1 in 10 policyholders has missed out on renewals in this financial year.

BENGALURU: India's technology sector expanded its workforce by 1.2 lakh people in 2024-25, with global capability centres (GCCs) accounting for over 1 lakh of these roles. It is significant that GCCs hired over 100,000 professionals during this period, up from 90,000 last year. Overall, the tech industry has 5.8 million employees.Through the first nine months of 2024-25, top Indian IT firms hired just 11,000 people. In fact, the top five Indian IT services organisations increased their workforce by only 5,190 employees during the 2023-24 financial year. TOI reported how this will be the second consecutive year where GCCs will surpass IT firms in net hiring.Even as India's tech sector is expected to become a $300 billion industry in the 2025-26, the last few years have seen business models become dynamic and outcome-based. For the first time, Nasscom highlighted an even distribution in export revenues of $224 billion between MNCs (including GCCs) and Indian IT firms, with each contributing $112 billion.The pendulum has swung from an employees' market to an employers' market, even as the IT sector's business model is undergoing a massive transformation, with AI disrupting the linear relationship between revenue and employment. The current scenario reflects a period when major IT companies are experiencing single-digit growth rates and workforce reductions, while GCCs contributed significantly to employment growth in the previous year.At the recent Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum (NTLF), HCL CEO C Vijayakumar said if the IT services industry is ""paranoid"" about the change like an ""existential threat,"" it will come out winners in the long term.Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar told TOI recently that with machines writing 20% of the code, teams can accomplish more tasks with fewer personnel. This, Kumar said, creates an interesting economic scenario known as Jevons Paradox, where increased efficiency in resource usage leads to higher overall demand for that resource. In AI's case, the efficiency it brings is enabling a lot more to be accomplished using AI, thereby increasing its use.Kumar said GCCs are not adversaries, and Cognizant is beginning to work actively with them to do some parts of their work. He said he has set up a team to cater to GCCs.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a tech growth advisory firm, said, ""It's akin to the tale of two cities. The past year was another year of tepid growth for major IT services companies and of outsized growth for GCCs, resulting in the net hiring by GCCs being substantially higher for the second year in a row,"" he said.Nasscom president Rajesh Nambiar believes IT firms and GCCs complement each other and can benefit from this synergy.","India's technology sector expanded its workforce by 1.2 lakh people in 2024-25.

MUMBAI: For the first time since 2006, The combined shareholding of mutual funds and retail investors is more than that of foreign portfolio investors, an analysis by NSE showed. This comes on the back of persistent selling by foreign funds since Oct last year while domestic institutions, dominated by mutual funds, remained net buyers.The analysis, using shareholding data disclosed by companies as of December 2024, also showed that foreign ownership of stocks listed on the NSE, at 17.4%, was the lowest in 13 years.Aided by sustained SIP inflows, MFs' share rose further to a all-time high of 10% in NSE listed companies, the analysis noted. ""MFs injected a record net amount of Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the December quarter, and further (about) Rs 71,000 crore in the first one-and-a half month of this quarter, taking the total net inflows to Rs 4.2 lakh crore in the fiscal thus far (as of Feb 14, 2025).""The analysis also showed that individual investors' direct non-promoter ownership in India Inc was at nearly 18-year high of 9.8%, corroborating with record investments of about Rs 56,000 crore in the Dec quarter. ""Individuals as direct and indirect (via MFs) investors (now) own a record-high of 18.2% of the total market cap, outpacing the share of FPIs (17.4% now) for the first time since 2006,"" researchers at NSE noted.In March 2014, the gap in ownership between FPIs and individual investors along with MFs was as high as 11 percentage points. This reversing of the gap indicates the growing role and significance of individual investors in the Indian equity markets. ""Strong performance of Indian equities, coupled with rising participation, has resulted in a significant increase in household wealth over the last few years. Our estimates suggest that the household wealth in Indian equities increased by over Rs 46 lakh crore in the last five years, and Rs 30 lakh crore in the last two years.""The analysis by researchers at NSE also showed a steady decline in promoter holding in Indian companies. ""Total promoters' share in the NSE-listed companies fell for the second quarter in a row 49.6%. The decline was broad-based across categories, with the most significant dip seen in the govt holding.

CHENNAI: 'Growth-PE' stage companies are seeing traction from private equity-venture capital (PE-VC) investors. The early trend, which is likely to continue for the rest of CY2025, reflects upon a shift to mitigate risk amid market uncertainties.Data released by research firm Venture Intelligence estimates that Growth-PE stage companies have doubled their PE-VC investments to nearly $1.1 billion in Jan and Feb of CY2025 against $594 million during the same period last year (CY2024).

Akasa Air and Neuberg Diagnostics are examples of larger business groups partnering PE investors for growth capital,"" Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence told TOI.The Growth-PE segment comprises Seed to Series D investments above $20 million into companies that are less than 10 years old or Series E to Series F of institutional investments into firms that are not more than a decade old.",'growth-pe' stage companies are seeing traction from private equity-venture capital investors.

Mahindra beats Hyundai in car sales & revenue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/mahindra-beats-hyundai-in-car-sales-revenue/articleshow/118668603.cms,"NEW DELHI: Mahindra & Mahindra has not only clinched the Number 2 slot in sales of passenger vehicles, but the demand for its premium off-roaders has also meant that the company has moved ahead of Korean Hyundai in revenue market share while getting the crown of the largest SUV seller in the country.Powered by sale of SUVs such as Scorpio-N, Thar, XUV7OO and XUV3XO, Mahindra's revenue in April-Jan 2024-25 stood at nearly Rs 71,000 crore, much ahead of Hyundai's Rs 58,653 crore and that of others like Toyota (Rs 51,945 crore) and Tata Motors (Rs 48,976 crore), according to the data accessed from research firm Jato. Only Maruti, the largest PV player, leads the segment with a revenue of over Rs 1.2 lakh crore.Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director & CEO of Mahindra's automotive and farm divisions, said the company has a clear focus on maintaining its volume and value leadership in SUVs, while driving in new ""adventure-ready"" off-roaders. ""For us, revenue market share is a more critical metric, and so is having the top position in SUVs. And in this process, if we also become the No. 2 PV player during certain periods, that's clearly an added bonus for us,"" Jejurikar told TOI.According to JATO, while Maruti leads the PV revenue market with a share of 30%, Mahindra comes in second with 17%, Hyundai third with 14%, Toyota fourth with 12.5%, and Tata Motors fifth with 12% (in ten months of this fiscal).In Jan this year, Mahindra emerged as the second-largest PV seller (behind only Maruti Suzuki) as it sold 50,420 units against 47,727 sold by Hyundai. Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, said the company expects demand to come back following income tax relaxation given in the Union Budget. ""Despite geopolitical challenges, we remain optimistic that the proposed tax reforms in the Budget and improved liquidity will provide the much-needed demand boost.""Mahindra has clearly gained from the growing demand for SUVs, especially as the company refreshed its aging fleet at a time when the positive trend started to build up for off-roaders. Rapidly-developing highways, better inter-city connectivity, and changing lifestyle trends have fuelled the demand for SUVs, giving them a share in excess of 50%.","Mahindra's revenue in april-jan 2024-25 stood at nearly rs 71,000 crore. Only maruti, the largest pv player, leads the segment with a revenue of over rs 1.2 lakh crore.
