What is KYV?

'Terrible Idea'

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.","Kyv was notified by national payments corporation of india (npci) to prevent fraud.

Isro to give Navy big boost in sea communication with new satellite launch on Nov 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-give-navy-big-boost-in-sea-communication-with-new-satellite-launch-on-nov-2/articleshow/124883517.cms,"NEW DELHI: Isro is set to hugely boost Indian Navy’s satellite-linked communication network by launching Gsat-7R (codeword CMS-03) from the Sriharikota spaceport on Nov 2. Gsat-7R, being considered the heaviest-ever communication satellite to be launched from Indian soil, will replace the aging satellite Gsat-7 (Rukmini), which is the backbone of naval communications on high seas at present.‘Rukmini’ has enabled secure real-time links between warships, submarines, aircraft and shore-based command centres across the Indian Ocean.With upgraded payloads, Gsat-7R or CMS-03 is designed to expand secure, multi-band communications for the Navy’s growing blue-water operations. Multi-band frequencies — UHF, S, C and Ku bands — will help transmit voice, video and data between warships, submarines and aircraft. The enhanced coverage will boost manifold India’s network-centric warfare capabilities and extend the Navy’s operational reach across critical maritime domains. CMS-03 will provide real-time communication for naval operations, air defence and strategic command control across a wide oceanic and terrestrial region.India's LVM3 rocket will be used to launch CMS-03, in what will be its fifth operational flight from Sriharikota.“The previous mission of LVM3 launched the Chandrayaan-3 mission, wherein India became the first country to land successfully near the lunar south pole,” Isro said in a statement.“CMS-03 is a multiband communication satellite that will provide services over a wide oceanic region, including the Indian landmass,” it said. It will provide sharper connectivity and increased bandwidth for civil, strategic and maritime users. Though Cyclone Montha has hit the Andhra Pradesh coast, a change in its direction has ensured that Isro’s satellite mission remains on schedule.The launch vehicle, LVM-3, has been fully assembled and integrated with the spacecraft and was moved to the launchpad on Oct 26 for further pre-launch operations, Isro said.Isro usually prefers launching heavier communication satellites from the European spaceport in French Guiana. This is the first time it will launch an around 4.4-tonne satellite from Indian soil. Isro had earlier launched Gsat-11, weighing 5,854 kg, from French Guiana using the services of Ariane-5 rocket, on Dec 5, 2018. While it is the heaviest satellite built by Isro so far, it was sent into space from a foreign spaceport.","Isro is set to hugely boost indian navy’s satellite-linked communication network.

The Centre has earned Rs 387 crore from the disposal of scrap gathered during the ongoing special cleanliness campaign, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Tuesday.The remarks came during a meeting of a group of ministers comprising Singh, the Union Minister of State for Personnel, to review the campaign. Youth Affairs Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu also attended it.The high-level review held here on Tuesday focused on assessing the progress of cleanliness drives, file disposal, and innovative waste-to-wealth practices being implemented across ministries and departments under the campaign.Singh said the government's cleanliness drive has matured into a transformative national movement that blends cleanliness with efficiency, transparency, and innovation.He said that against a target of 7.56 lakh sites, ministries and departments have already covered 5.57 lakh sites, achieving 73.7 per cent progress by October 27, 2025, a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.""So far, the campaign has generated Rs 387.4 crore in revenue through disposal of scrap and e-waste, freed 148.19 lakh square feet of space, and weeded out 19.21 lakh files against the set targets,"" it said.As many as 5.51 lakh cases of public grievance have been disposed of out of a target of 7.04 lakh, while 12,402 appeals have been addressed out of 17,402 targeted, the statement said.Singh said that the campaign, which began on October 2 and is set to culminate on October 31, marks a decisive step in institutionalising cleanliness and record management across government offices.""Each version of this campaign has taken us to the next level -- from file disposal to freeing up office space, and now, to turning waste into wealth. What began as a cleanliness initiative has evolved into a behavioural and economic reform,"" he said.Since its inception in 2021, the cumulative outcomes of the special campaign series have been substantial, covering 19.61 lakh cleanliness sites, freeing 844.46 lakh square feet of office space, closing or weeding out 157.07 lakh files, and earning Rs 3,684 crore in revenue for the government.Singh said these achievements reflect not just administrative efficiency but also innovative thinking within government institutions.He said that new models are being implemented under the waste-to-wealth initiative, such as AIIMS' experiment in recycling bio-laboratory waste into reusable material, and the conversion of used cooking oil into low-cost fuel through NGO partnerships, according to the statement.""These are models of sustainability that also offer economic and social benefits. Our goal is to make waste management a part of our daily administrative and civic behaviour,"" the minister said.He also highlighted the collaboration between Tata Steel and government agencies in using steel plant by-products for eco-friendly road construction.""Such practices demonstrate how the private sector can contribute meaningfully to sustainable development,"" Singh added.Calling for sustained efforts beyond October 31, the minister urged ministries to adopt successful models and maintain cleanliness, efficiency, and grievance redressal as year-round priorities.""We are institutionalising cleanliness not as a symbolic exercise but as an ethos of governance. The waste to wealth movement must now become part of our administrative DNA where cleanliness, productivity, and innovation go hand in hand,"" he added.

Read TCS clarification on M&S cyber attack

In response to the article published by ‘The Telegraph’ Newspaper in the UK on October 26, 2025, titled “M&S ousts Indian outsourcer accused of £300m cyberattack failures”, a statement of the Company is given below:

“The report published by The Telegraph is misleading, with factual inaccuracies including the size of the contract and the continuity of TCS’ work for Marks & Spencer (M&S). As both M&S and TCS have clarified, the service desk contract with M&S followed a regular competitive RFP process initiated in January 2025, with M&S opting to proceed with other partners much prior to the cyber incident in April 2025. These matters are hence clearly Unrelated.

The commercial aspect of the service desk area also represents an insignificant part of TCS’ overall engagement with M&S. TCS continues to work on numerous other areas, in its role as a strategic partner for M&S and is proud of this longstanding partnership.

On the Cyber incident itself, as clarified previously, TCS had conducted a scan of its own networks and systems and been able to conclude that the vulnerabilities have not originated from there. TCS does not provide cyber security services to M&S. This is a service that is provided by another partner.”

This is for your information and record.

The attack disrupted M&S online shopping with customers reporting glitches in M&S stores. Specifically, contactless card payments and “Click & Collect” order pickups were hit due to the attack.According to reports in early June, M&S CEO Stuart Machin received an email from hacking group DragonForce using an employee email account. The email confirmed that M&S was hacked by the ransomware group, who allegedly encrypted all the company’s servers.The ransomware group used a double extortion method. They first got into the system through a social engineering phone call and spent time collecting sensitive customer data. After stealing the data, they launched the DragonForce ransomware to lock the systems and demand money.As per estimates, the cyber attack hit this year's profits by around £300 million.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","X witnessing executive exodus amid strategic churn.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription.

Reports of a “Gmail security breach impacting millions of users” are false. Gmail’s defenses are strong, and users remain protected.

The inaccurate reports are stemming from a misunderstanding of infostealer databases, which routinely compile various credential theft activity occurring across the web. It’s not reflective of a new attack aimed at any one person, tool, or platform.

Users can protect themselves from credential theft by turning on 2-step verification and adopting passkeys as a stronger and safer alternative to passwords, and resetting passwords when they are found in large batches like this.

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal moment in the UAE’s drive to integrate more Emiratis into the private workforce. Companies that fully align with the targets will find significant opportunity in incentives; those that delay risk fines, downgraded status, and the growing risk of legal enforcement.",Uae pushes private sector to boost emirati workforce.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.
