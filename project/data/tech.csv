New licensing framework for Hajj season 2026





How the Hajj accommodation licensing process works





Register via the Nusuk Masar platform, the centralized system for pilgrim service coordination.

Apply through the Ministry of Tourism’s electronic platform at https://tlg.mt.gov.sa/, ensuring all requirements are met.

Goals and benefits of the seasonal licensing model for Hajj





Improve service quality by enforcing seasonal standards that must be met by all participating accommodations.

Increase accommodation capacity during the peak Hajj period through regulated, short-term approvals.

Integrate licensed properties with the Nusuk platform, allowing for centralized and organized booking management.

Ensure safety and compliance through the use of official electronic verification and registration systems.

Coordination between ministries





The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, overseeing the spiritual and logistical aspects of the pilgrimage.

The Ministry of Tourism, responsible for regulating hospitality services.

The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing, contributing to urban planning and infrastructure readiness.





To streamline the accommodation process for Hajj 2026, Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah. The initiative, developed through inter-ministerial collaboration, focuses on enhancing service standards, ensuring compliance, and organizing bookings through official digital platforms.The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has formally introduced a temporary hostel licensing service for accommodations specifically catering to pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah during the upcoming Hajj season of 1447 AH (2026). This seasonal licensing model has been jointly developed with two other key government bodies, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing — in a coordinated and streamlined governmental effort to efficiently manage the large influx of pilgrims more effectively and safely.Unlike permanent hotel licenses, this new initiative targets properties seeking short-term regulatory approval specifically for the Hajj period. Existing hotel establishments with active, year-round licenses issued officially by the Ministry of Tourism are exempt from this seasonal licensing process entirely.To obtain a license under the new system, applicants must complete two steps:The deadline for securing the necessary license is 13th Sha'ban 1447 AH, corresponding to February 1, 2026.All licenses must be finalized before this contracting period closes. No applications will be accepted beyond this date.The temporary hostel licensing system has been introduced to:By creating a standardized process and tying it to official digital infrastructure, the authorities aim to deliver a smoother, more reliable lodging experience for pilgrims.This licensing overhaul reflects a high level of coordination between:Together, these entities have designed a system that balances religious, administrative, and tourism-related requirements, making it easier for property owners and service providers to align with national Hajj goals.",Saudi arabia’s new hajj 2026 licensing system requires pilgrim accommodations to register via nusuk masar platform.

Elon Musk maintains lead over rivals as Larry Ellison briefly challenges his fortune

Elon Musk navigates Tesla challenges while expanding into AI, robotics, and emerging tech

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion, highlighting his unrivaled influence in the global technology and business arena. This unprecedented milestone is driven largely by the soaring value of Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose shares have surged due to strong sales, innovation, and investor confidence. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s wealth is bolstered by his space exploration venture SpaceX, which continues to secure contracts and expand its satellite operations, and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, which is gaining traction in the AI sector. Musk’s diversified portfolio, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on technological breakthroughs have positioned him as the world’s richest individual, reshaping industries along the way.On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes reported that Musk’s net worth briefly reached $500.1 billion before settling slightly above $499 billion later in the day. This exceptional wealth cements Musk’s position as the world’s richest person, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the technology sector.The billionaire’s wealth is closely tied to his 12%+ stake in Tesla, which has experienced a remarkable surge in stock value over the past year. Tesla shares were up more than 3.3% at the end of trading on Wednesday and have risen over 20% year-to-date, reflecting growing investor confidence in Musk’s leadership and strategic vision. While Tesla remains the cornerstone of Musk’s fortune, his other ventures have contributed substantially to his net worth. The space exploration company SpaceX has seen increased valuation due to ongoing satellite and launch contracts, while his AI-focused startup, xAI, has gained attention in the tech world for cutting-edge developments.Recent months have also seen Musk redirecting his focus toward business rather than politics, a move that investors have welcomed. This strategic pivot is seen as a key factor behind Tesla’s stock gains and the corresponding growth of his personal wealth.According to Forbes’ billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison holds the second spot globally with a fortune of roughly $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after Oracle shares jumped more than 40%, driven by positive forecasts for its cloud infrastructure, AI initiatives, and enterprise software growth, particularly in healthcare and financial services sectors.Despite occasional competition from rivals, Musk’s diversified portfolio, including Tesla, SpaceX, and other innovative ventures, and his leadership across multiple high-growth sectors have reinforced his long-term wealth trajectory, placing him comfortably ahead in the billionaire rankings and maintaining his influence in global business and technology markets with unparalleled reach and ambition.Musk’s influence at Tesla is now more pronounced than ever. In September 2025, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm highlighted that Musk is “front and centre” in guiding the company’s strategy.Tesla’s board has also approved a potential pay package exceeding $1 trillion for Musk, contingent upon achieving highly ambitious targets over the next decade. These goals include boosting Tesla’s valuation eightfold, selling one million AI robots, delivering 12 million additional Tesla cars, and reaching several other business milestones.Musk’s recent $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares has been interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s future prospects.Tesla has faced multiple challenges in recent years, including intensified competition from global electric vehicle makers such as China’s BYD. However, Musk continues to diversify Tesla’s portfolio, transitioning the company into AI and robotics, and expanding into digital currencies and other emerging technologies.Musk is also known for his outspoken views on social and political issues, including immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While he faced criticism earlier this year over his involvement with the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he has consistently emphasized that his business pursuits are driven by societal and technological impact rather than personal profit.Musk’s relentless work ethic and focus on transformative projects have become hallmarks of his career. As Tesla investor Ross Gerber notes, “Elon only involves himself with things he believes are important for society or humanity,” a principle that underscores his broader mission beyond financial gain. By combining innovation across electric vehicles, space exploration, AI, and digital technologies, Musk has not only become the first half-trillionaire but has also reshaped the global technology landscape, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.","Elon musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion.

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

How Pavel Durov became Dubai's richest





In a country where royal families and oil tycoons dominate the wealth landscape, the richest man in Dubai is a tech billionaire. Meet Telegram CEO Pavel Durov who is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list. Durov is followed by Hussain Sajwani – chairman of Dubai-based luxury real estate developer Damac Properties, with a net worth of $10.2 billion. Globally, Pavel Durov ranks at number 118 in the Forbes global list. His rise reflects not only the global reach of his messaging app but also Dubai’s growing status as a hub for technology and innovation.Born in St. Petersburg in 1984, Pavel Durov is often referred to as “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”. Durov first made his name by co-founding VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. But after clashes with authorities, he sold his stake and left the country in 2014. That same year, he shifted focus to Telegram, which has since exploded into a global platform with over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide.Durov left Russia after refusing to cooperate with the secret service and provide encrypted data of his first social network's users.Telegram was banned in Russia from 2018 to 2021.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system; it was shut down after the SEC banned it.Pavel Durov became a French citizen in 2021 but lives in Dubai. As per information available on Forbes billionaires website, he has five children that he shares with two ex-girlfriends. In the past, Durov has claimed to have donated sperm that led to him fathering 100 children.Durov relocated to Dubai, where Telegram is now headquartered. He later acquired UAE citizenship in February 2021.Relocating to Dubai gave Durov not only a strategic base for expansion but also UAE citizenship, placing him in a unique spot among the country’s wealthiest. Though Telegram app remains free to use, Durov introduced Telegram Premium in 2022, offering paid features to power users. This, combined with the platform’s high valuation, cemented his billionaire status.","Telegram ceo pavel durov is the richest man in the united arab emirates (uae) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to forbes billionaires list.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

A Social Outlet, to a Point





By Claire Cain Miller & Amy FanIn the last decade and a half, boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming, to about 10 hours a week, according to a major survey.Some teachers say gaming has disrupted focus in classrooms. Some economists have linked it to the decline in young men's work hours. Many readers told us it was a chief reason for the recent struggles of boys and young men, when we started our series on the subject in May.Yet video games also serve an important role in young people's lives. They've become a central way that young people socialise and provide them - especially boys - with a sense of belonging.The increase in time boys and young men spent playing games was the biggest of any activity measured by the American Time Use Survey, the large federal survey that each year asks a nationally representative sample of thousands of people what they did every minute of a day. (The category includes other types of games, like cards, but evidence suggests it's mostly video games.)The rise has coincided with technological changes that made games much more engrossing.Gaming went from an activity done at home on a console or computer to one also done on phones, anywhere and anytime.While parents have always worried about video games (especially whether playing certain games causes violence, a connection that has not been proved), a pressing concern now is about time spent playing. As it has increased, the fear is that video games have displaced other activities in boys' and young men's lives - including physical activity, in-person socialising, homework, jobs and sleep.""Boys would rather sit in front of Minecraft or Fortnite than play outside,"" said Susan Donohoe, an elementary schoolteacher in Portland, Maine. ""They are living a virtual life instead of real outside play and chores, which develop social skills and responsibility.""Yet researchers, and teens themselves, said these virtual worlds were also a place to make and build real friendships.Most teenagers play games with others, even if they're not physically with them, according to a nationwide survey of 1,500 teenagers published last year by the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital.Boys - who researchers say tend to prefer doing activities while they're spending time with friends, more than having face-to-face conversations - are more likely than girls to game with others, the survey found. They are more likely to talk with friends while playing, like on FaceTime or Discord. And there is a social cost to abstaining.""It's an opportunity for boys to build up their community and feel connected to others,"" said Zhiying Yue, a scientist at the Digital Wellness Lab who is also a gamer.The hobby is nearly universal: 97% of teenage boys play online games, according to a Pew Research Center survey of teenagers last year, as do 73% of girls. But boys spend much more time doing it, the time use survey showed - 10 hours a week in 2024, compared with two for girls.Young people play video games to satisfy core developmental needs, said Yue: competence, by developing mastery; autonomy, by creating avatars and exploring worlds; and relatedness, by connecting with peers. These are things all adolescents crave, research shows. But boys and young men might seek them in the online world at a time when many say they're feeling adrift in the offline one.The risk is that new technology has made games much more immersive and addictive, said Zach Rausch, chief researcher at Tech and Society Lab at New York University.The major change, he said, came in the 2010s when many games became free to start playing, versus purchased upfront. This shifted companies' business models - the goal became to maximize the time people spent and incentivize small, in-game purchases.Online games update constantly, reward daily check-ins, sell limited-edition virtual goods and make real-time tweaks to keep players hooked. Many never end, making them hard to put down.By 2015, these changes had reshaped gaming - and the hours boys and young men spent playing had pulled ahead of the hours they spent on sports or hanging out with friends or family, the data shows.Males are more susceptible to video game addiction than females, who are more likely to become addicted to social media, research has shown. One reason is that males tend to be drawn to competition and risk-taking, said Dr. Marc Potenza, who studies addiction at the Yale School of Medicine. Brain scans show that when males play video games, they have stronger activation than females in the brain region involved in reward processing.While the Digital Wellness Lab survey found that lonelier adolescents gamed more, gaming didn't alleviate their loneliness - a pattern that was more pronounced for boys. This could be because those with weak social skills were more comfortable making friends online, but then got less practice interacting offline, researchers said.None of the researchers suggested parents ban video games. Games are important to how children bond today, they said, and there are also benefits for cognitive and problem-solving skills, mood and self-esteem. Instead, they recommended parents play alongside children, monitor the time they spend, and have conversations about risks.",Boys and young men ages 15-24 more than doubled their average time spent gaming. Some teachers say gaming has disrupted focus in classrooms. Some economists have linked it to the decline in young men's work hours. But video games also serve an important role in young people's lives.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124315506,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40068,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss?

Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari weiss, a former new york times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a monday announcement.

'AI an industrial bubble

that will benefit society'





TURIN: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos predicted on Friday that gigawatt-scale data centres will be built in space within the next 10 to 20 years and that continuously available solar energy meant they would eventually outperform those based on Earth.The concept of orbital data centres has gained traction among tech giants as those on Earth have driven up demand for electricity and water to cool their servers.""These giant training clusters, those will be better built in space, because we have solar power there, 24/7. There are no clouds and no rain, no weather,"" Bezos said in a public conversation with Ferrari and Stellantis chairman John Elkann at the Italian Tech Week in Turin.""We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centres in space in the next couple of decades,"" he said.Bezos said the shift to space infrastructure is part of a broader trend of using space to improve life on Earth. ""It's already happened with weather and communication satellites,"" he said. ""The next step is data centres, then other kinds of manufacturing.""Hosting data centres in space has its own challenges, including the difficulty of maintenance and carrying out upgrades and the cost of launching rockets, as well as the risk the launches may fail.Artificial intelligence is in an ""industrial bubble,"" Bezos said, but the benefits to society will be ""immense"".""Investors don't usually give a team of six people a couple billion dollars with no product... and that's happening today,"" he said. ""This is a kind of industrial bubble,"" said Bezos, who has invested in the AI startup Perplexity. ""But that is not the same as a banking bubble such as the 2008 crisis.""""Those bubbles society wants to avoid. The ones that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it could even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions... and that's what's going to happen here.""""This is real,"" Bezos continued. ""The benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic."" Multiple technologies are in a kind of ""golden age,"" he said, echoing language used by US President Trump. ""There's never been a better time to be excited about the future.""""AI is real.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:





Driven by a youthful population and a mobile-first approach, India is getting sucked big-time into digital junk on social media platforms even as western nations are showing signs of plateauing and even declining in this aspect.A recent analysis by the digital audience insights company GWI reveals that daily time spent on social platforms by adults in developed countries has been on a downward trend since a peak in 2022 even as it is rising in India. By the end of 2024, usage in the west was down by nearly 10% from its high point, the decline most pronounced in Europe, although the jury is still out on the effect of AI, which is now throwing up new content.However, India's story is one of rapid and ongoing growth. With a median age of just 28.8, India is one of the world's most youthful nations, and this demographic is fueling its digital expansion. The country's users spend an average of 2 hours and 28 minutes per day on social media, notably higher than the U.S. average of 2 hours and 9 minutes per day, and far higher than Europe’s 1 hour 48 minutes.The divergence in usage trends is also reflected in platform preferences and content consumption.In India, platforms that facilitate a mobile-first, video-heavy, and community-driven experience are the most popular. WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram are major players, with short-form video content like Reels and Shorts dominating engagement.The data suggests that for many in the West, the initial novelty and high engagement of social media are fading. Binge is now cringe. This downward trend is seen most among heaviest historical users: teenagers and people in their twenties.While platforms like TikTok – which is banned in India – are popular in the U.S., the overall consumption patterns are different, with some reports indicating a shift away from reflexive, time-filling scrolling toward more intentional online activities. In other words, westerners are turning up their nose and nos, while Indians are plunging headlong into brain rot, sucking in social media slop just as they are with junk food and sugary drinks, while social media giants are picking their pockets.In a recent essay, the technology writer Cory Doctorow identified a three-stage life cycle for these platforms in a process he called ""enshittification,"" – a predictable pattern of decay as they evolve to prioritize shareholder profit over user value.Stage 1: They are good to their users (Bait). The platform offers a genuinely good service—often at a loss—to attract a massive, locked-in user base. Stage 2: (Switch). Once users are locked in (due to network effects or switching costs), the platform begins shifting the ""surplus"" value away from them and toward its business customers (suppliers, creators, advertisers). Stage 3: (Extraction). Finally, with both users and business customers fully dependent, the platform exploits the business customers, clawing back all remaining value to maximize profit for its shareholders. The platform becomes a ""useless pile of shit,"" filled with ""botshit, crap gadgets,"" and advertising scams.There is now a growing movement towards digital detoxification in the west even as the situation is aggravated by AI – illustrated by the America’s troller-in-chief himself dispensing AI-generated garbage, adding to the copious output of social media sewage. Grassroots Advocacy organizations like the youth-led ""LOG OFF Movement"" are urging people to reject what is being called the “attention economy” amid a push to regulate social media companies, despite the major ones having burrowed their way into Washington DC and now allied with the ruling dispensation.","India is getting sucked big-time into digital junk on social media platforms.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by hamptons shows that indian investors are followed by nigerians, poles and irish.

China's K visa faces online backlash: Locals vent on Weibo; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-k-visa-faces-online-backlash-locals-vent-on-weibo-heres-why/articleshow/124309445.cms,"Representational photo

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The k visa, described as china’s version of the h-1b, was announced in august.
