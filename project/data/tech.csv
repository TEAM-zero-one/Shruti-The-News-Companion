IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

NEW DELHI: Two months after IndiGo ’s mass flight cancellation in the wake of non-compliance with flying time norms, Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Wednesday ordered a detailed probe into its alleged unfair business practices.It said the carrier enjoyed “a position of dominance” in the airline business, noting that it operated exclusively on 330 routes, had consistently had 60%-61% market share and a much larger fleet than its rival Air India.Bengaluru-based Kartikeya Rawal had moved CCI after his flight on Dec 5 last year was cancelled and alternative ones were available only at higher prices. He alleged the overcharging by IndiGo was “abuse of dominance”. The airline contested the claim, while arguing that CCI did not have jurisdiction in the case.“…IndiGo is a significant market player… (has) effective control over market capacity and supply-side conditions. The domestic passenger aviation market exhibits very high and increasing concentration, exhibiting leading firms possess the ability to operate independently of competitive forces, as the presence of effective rivals is materially constrained,” the regulator said in a 16-page order uploaded on its website.In 2025, IndiGo had 64% domestic market share, followed by Air India group with 27%, Akasa with 5.1%, and other smaller airlines the remaining 3.9%, according to DGCA data.“..IndiGo operates the largest fleet with over 400 aircraft, which is significantly higher than that of its nearest competitor, Air India, which operates a fleet of (about) 191 aircraft. Therefore, on the basis of substantial and sustained market share, wide network reach with exclusive operations on a significant number of city-pair routes, comparatively larger fleet and strong financial performance, the commission is of prima facie view that (IndiGo) enjoys a position of dominance in the relevant market,” CCI said.The order said “by cancelling thousands of flights constituting a significant portion of the scheduled capacity, IndiGo effectively withheld its service from the market, creating an artificial scarcity, limiting consumer access to air travel during peak demand. Such conduct by a dominant enterprise may be viewed as restricting the provision of services.”The order added passengers who had booked tickets were left with “no real choice but to accept last-minute cancellations. Further, passengers were left to seek alternatives, on their own, at significantly higher prices. Given IndiGo’s dominant position, consumers were effectively locked in and lacked viable alternatives which appears to be in violation of (rules).”Cancellation of flights and lack of alternatives for passengers seemed to be “prima facie causing an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. Thus, the Commission is of the opinion that a prima facie case of contravention of provisions is made out in the present matter.”","Competition commission of india orders probe into indigo's alleged unfair business practices.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday flagged the substantial haircuts taken by creditors in proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after being told how the bankrupt Reliance Communications of Anil Ambani group was bought at a throwaway price by Mukesh Ambani ’s Reliance Jio.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Apropos the SC’s concern, govt of India is seriously looking into this issue arising in IBC proceedings. I cannot elaborate as I am part of that discussion. It is receiving very serious consideration at the appropriate quarter.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that Reliance Communications had outstanding dues of Rs 47,000 crore and in bankruptcy proceedings, it was sold for Rs 455 crore, that is, 1% of the outstanding amount. It was sold to his brother’s company.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Anil Ambani group, said such a sale was a public process, whether the buyer was a brother or anyone else. But the CJI-led bench said, “Unfortunately, IBC proceedings are misused nowadays. The assets of a company in debt are undervalued. Then it is put on a sham auction and, in a planned manner, a family member or a friend buys it.”The bench added, “Every day such matters are coming up before the court.”The SG said, “The haircut (suffered by creditors) is phenomenal.” Bhushan po-inted out that “surprisingly, bankruptcy is declared by the very company which is facing bankruptcy”.The CJI remarked, “It is a nice plan. Voluntarily declare bankruptcy and then get evaluated by friendly valuers at 10% of the market value. Unfortunately, the conduct of resolution professionals is not above board.”Rohatgi said instead of investigation and prosecution, the court could appoint a committee of experts that estimates the amount due from ADAG, and then the Anil Ambani group could repay that amount in instalments over a period of time. That would serve the purpose, he said.The bench said CBI and ED should investigate the matter thoroughly and get to the bottom of the case. “We will monitor the investigations, and if we find them to be slack in probing the cases, we will pass appropriate directions,” it said.",Supreme court on wednesday flagged the substantial haircuts taken by creditors in proceedings under insolvency and bankruptcy code (ibc) the bankrupt reliance communications of anil ambani group was bought at a throwaway price by mukesh ambani ’s reliance jio.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127920736,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-138692,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Oba Femi’s estimated net worth and income sources

What Oba Femi’s WWE contract probably looks like

Oba Femi has been on a fast, stunning, and lucrative track from college athletics to TV with WWE. The powerhouse, who was born in Nigeria and goes by the real name Isaac Odugbesan, made his way to pro wrestling via WWE's Next In Line program and quickly took NXT by storm as its most destructive force. His brute strength, magnetic personality, and great ring work led him to championships and gave him a reputation as one of the company’s young stars.As with most of the WWE stars in developing roles, the details surrounding Femi’s pay are not public. WWE does not disclose contract figures, especially for talent less than a year into a deal. Still, wrestling insiders and analysts have come up with rough estimates, referencing standard developmental contracts and bonus structures, as well as other ways for FCW wrestlers to make money, such as merchandise sales, for example, and appearances at live events.Oba Femi is estimated to have a net worth between $200,000 and $500,000 as of now. It's still new territory for a guy who's spent most of his career in NXT, but is finally getting a little more exposure on the main roster, so those numbers are just average. His earnings through salary, performance bonuses, and promotional opportunities are tied to WWE programming.Femi likely had a run of type of a standard developmental contract money when he was in NXT.Sources in the wrestling world state that the majority of those in NXT earn a base salary between $50,000 and $100,000 per annum, depending on experience and where they are placed on the card. Performers also earn extra income through match bonuses, special event payouts, and merchandise sales. The more prominent and popular Femi has received on Raw, the more he is able to earn, with regular Raw appearances hopefully coming soon.The specific terms of Oba Femi's WWE deal have not been disclosed, but the arrangement is presumably similar to those of other athletes who have come into the company through the promotion's NIL route. These deals are typically developmental deals that contain a lot of training at the Performance Centre, working NXT television tapings, and setting up a character for long-term success.Those contracts usually consist of a baseline salary guarantee, plus bonuses for championships, big shows, and increased television exposure. When a performer transitions to the Raw or SmackDown roster full-time, their pay usually goes up significantly. Higher merchandise royalties, global tour payments, and sponsorships are also available to main roster stars and can add to their annual earnings.","Oba femi has been on a fast, stunning, and lucrative track from college athletics to tv with wwe.

TheBurntPeanut dominates Twitch viewership charts in January 2026

VTubers continue to rise in popularity on the leading streaming platforms, but January 2026 was undoubtedly the month of TheBurntPeanut. The VTuber was still basking in the glory of being named VTuber of the Year when it reached the pinnacle of Twitch’s viewership rankings. According to the latest statistics provided by StreamsCharts, TheBurntPeanut topped the list of most-watched streamers on the platform, leaving some of the largest names on the site, such as Asmongold, Hasan, and Caedrel, in its wake.TheBurntPeanut is recognized for his minimalist yet chaotic visual aesthetic. He employs a face filter reminiscent of Snapchat, where his head is transformed into a giant peanut while maintaining his actual eyes and mouth in a cartoon-like fashion. This distinct approach has allowed him to differentiate himself from other content creators. His live streams of ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov have garnered enormous popularity. Consequently, his Twitch subscribers have increased to 1.8 million, making him one of the elite content creators on the platform.According to StreamsCharts, TheBurntPeanut had a remarkable 11.3 million hours viewed in January 2026.This represented a 29% increase from December 2025, which was accomplished in just over 196 hours of total streaming time. His ARC Raiders streams remained popular, despite his open criticism of issues such as cheating and stream sniping. At one stage, the VTuber threatened to leave the game if the developers did not resolve these issues, further heightening the drama of his streams.Behind him, Asmongold finished second with 8.40 million hours watched. Hasan followed with 6.82 million hours, despite receiving a brief Twitch ban late in the month. Caedrel also posted strong numbers, reaching 7.14 million hours watched thanks to his coverage of LEC and LCK League of Legends matches. Other familiar names, including GamesDoneQuick, Jynxzi, StableRonaldo, xQc, Caseoh, and Japanese streamer Junichi, rounded out the broader top rankings.The results of January are a testament to the strength of TheBurntPeanut’s momentum. Although it is early in the year 2026, it seems that TheBurntPeanut has set the bar very high. Whether he will be able to sustain this position or whether new competition will emerge is one of the most intriguing stories on Twitch.","According to streamscharts, theburntpeanut had a remarkable 11.3 million hours viewed in january 2026.

Anthropic AI: Explained: What is Anthropic's AI tool that wiped $285 billion off software stocks in a single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-anthropics-ai-tool-that-wiped-285-billion-off-software-stocks-in-a-single-day/articleshow/127892310.cms,"What exactly did Anthropic release

Why the market panic over a folder of prompts

What does this mean for the software industry going forward

Anthropic's newly launched AI plugins have triggered what analysts are calling a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session. The AI developer, known for its Claude chatbot, released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30. One of them targets legal workflows, and that alone was enough to send investors running for the exits.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%. RELX, owner of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom got hammered nearly 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket tracking US software stocks posted its worst single-day decline since April's tariff-driven selloff. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%, with ripple effects extending to Indian IT giants—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5% and Wipro fell nearly 5%.Claude Cowork is an agentic AI assistant that Anthropic launched earlier in January. Think of it as Claude Code—the company's developer-focused coding tool—but redesigned for non-technical professionals. It can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent.The plugins announced last Friday supercharge this capability. They let companies tailor Claude to specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.But it was the legal plugin that spooked markets. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings. Anthropic was careful to note that all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys and that the tool does not provide legal advice. That disclaimer did little to calm investors.Here's the thing that has caught many observers off guard: the legal plugin is essentially a set of prompts and configurations. There's no proprietary model fine-tuned on case law, no special legal reasoning engine. It's Claude being Claude, but with structured workflow instructions.The real signal, analysts say, is that Anthropic has moved from selling the model to owning the workflow. When Claude was just an API, companies like Thomson Reuters could build on top of it. Thomson Reuters literally runs CoCounsel on OpenAI. But when Anthropic starts publishing ready-made vertical solutions, the platform becomes the competitor.Jefferies dubbed the selloff a 'SaaSpocalypse', noting that investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. The narrative used to be that AI helps software companies. Now it's that AI replaces them. 'Trading is very much get-me-out style selling,' said Jeffrey Favuzza from Jefferies' equity trading desk. The brokerage also noted that OpenAI appears to be losing ground in the corporate market to Anthropic's Claude, with enterprises now accounting for 80% of Anthropic's business.The damage extended well beyond legal tech. DocuSign fell 11%, Salesforce dropped nearly 7%, Adobe slid 7%, and ServiceNow declined 7%. Business development companies with exposure to software loans also got caught in the selling. Blue Owl Capital Corp fell 13%, marking a record ninth consecutive decline.Anthropic isn't the only player in legal AI. Startups like Harvey AI (valued at $5 billion) and Legora ($1.8 billion valuation) have been developing tools for years. But Anthropic's advantage is that it builds its own underlying models. Firms like Legora rely on models from developers like Anthropic, which means Claude's creator can potentially disrupt both traditional legal services and the startups trying to disrupt them.The company's growth trajectory underscores why investors are taking this threat seriously. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, just months after its May launch. Anthropic is now reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation—up sharply from $61.5 billion in March 2025.The iteration speed is also striking. Cowork launched on January 12. The plugins dropped less than three weeks later. Enterprise software companies typically spend quarters on such releases.For software executives watching the carnage unfold, the takeaway is uncomfortable but clear: Anthropic didn't need a breakthrough product to rattle markets. It just needed to show what Claude could already do—and hit publish.","Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for its claude cowork tool.

CZI’s focus on Biohub

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The chan zuckerberg initiative (czi) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

'Sorry Papa': Suicide Note From Three Sisters In Ghaziabad Triggers Debate On Gaming Addiction

Momo challenge

PUBG

The deaths of three minor girls in Ghaziabad has once again brought attention to the risks linked to certain online games and digital challenges. According to initial reports, the sisters – Nishika (16), Prachi (14), and Pakhi (12) were addicted to an online Korean gaming that allegedly involved completing a series of 50 tasks. The three minor allegedly committed suicide as part of the task-based game. While the probe is still ongoing, the case has renewed concerns around how online content, especially games and viral challenges, can affect young users. Over the years, several games and online trends have been linked—directly or indirectly—to suicide cases, sparking debate among parents, educators, mental health experts, and authorities about online safety, supervision, and digital well-being.The story of Blue whale challenge began in 2015 with the death of Rina Palenkova, a teenager living in south-eastern Russia. Her death was followed by other teenage suicides. Many of these teenagers were later found to be a part of a same group, leading to speculation about how Blue whale challenge became linked to suicide.Blue whale challenge was reported to be an online ""suicide game"" aimed at teenagers. Under the gameplay, the teenagers were given 50 tasks that were to be completed over 50 days.Authorities in India and abroad issued multiple warnings against the game. At the same time, social media platforms took steps to remove related content. While many experts later said several claims were exaggerated or unverified, the panic around Blue Whale highlighted how anonymous online challenges can influence vulnerable users.Allegedly linked to the death of a 12-year old girl in Argentina, the Momo challenge made headlines in 2018. The game then referred to an online challenge that had apparently started on Facebook, for which an avatar of a grotesque woman was used.The momo challenge was linked to disturbing images and messages sent through messaging apps and videos. The challenge was widely blamed for causing fear and panic among parents, with reports suggesting it encouraged self-harm. Later investigations found that many claims were hoaxes or misinformation.Another game that has been associated with gaming disorder and gaming addiction is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Currently banned in India, some scholars argue that the game has a negative influence on children and youth and that it promotes cruelty, violence, and aggression.In extreme cases, there have been case reports of self‐harm and suicide, among PUBG players who have been asked by their parents to stop playing the game, especially during Covid.","'sorry papa': suicide note from three sisters in ghaziabad triggers debate on gaming addiction.

GURGAON: A wedding video of popular Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility after visuals surfaced showing large amounts of cash and gold being presented during wedding rituals, even as the gifts were described as “daan” (donation) and not dowry.Panwar, a resident of Gurugram and originally from Indri village in Sohna, is going to get married to Dr Tithi. Wedding ceremonies held on January 30 sparked criticism.In a reel uploaded on Panwar’s Instagram account, a person is seen reading out a detailed list of items allegedly given as “daan”. The narration mentions, “Ladke ki chain saade paanch tole ki,” followed by a list that includes a 4 tola bracelet, two gold rings for engagement and marriage, jewellery for the groom’s father, uncle, brothers, mother, sister-in-law and the bride’s sister. The video further claims that a total of 21 tolas of gold and Rs 71 lakh in cash were given.The video quickly went viral, drawing sharp criticism from social media users who questioned whether influencers were normalising dowry under the guise of tradition. “Are influencers now promoting dowry?” one user asked. Another commented, “We live in a society where all of this is applauded. No wonder we’re so doomed.” Some users even questioned why no legal action had been taken if such practices were being displayed publicly.A particularly pointed comment noted that the bride is a highly educated doctor, saying it was disturbing that such practices continued even when the woman involved is professionally accomplished.Arun Panwar began his YouTube career in 2019 and is known for automobile-related content such as car reviews, mileage tests, feature breakdowns and ownership experiences.He holds a BCA degree and has built a strong digital presence, with over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and around one million followers on Instagram.A car enthusiast, Panwar owns several premium vehicles, including a Kia Seltos, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner and Mahindra Thar.The viral wedding video has once again brought the issue of dowry into focus, raising questions about the role of social media influencers and whether rebranding such exchanges as “gifts” or “donations” can obscure practices that are legally prohibited and socially contested.",Haryana youtuber arun pawar's wedding raises eyebrows on social media.

ChatGPT to balance ads with organic answers

ChatGPT ads pilot program

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI recently announced that it will soon integrate ads in the chatbot. Now, days after making the announcement the company has revealed that it is planning to build an ‘ads integrity’ team in order to make sure that its new business model does not compromise the trust of its users and prevent any kids of scams. As reported by Business Insider, a job listing posted in late January describes the role as part of a “0 → 1 team,” meaning it will be built from scratch to design systems that protect users from harmful or misleading advertising.The listing highlights that the key responsibilities of the team will be developing “know your customer” (KYC) systems to verify advertiser identities and assess risk. KYC, widely used in finance, is a labor-intensive but crucial safeguard against scam ads and fraudulent content. The issue has become pressing for tech companies with self-service ad platforms—Meta, for example, said it removed 134 million scam ads in 2025, according to a Reuters investigation.As per the report, Arilla Gracia, COO of the Check My Ads Institute, noted that while KYC is a strong foundation, the real test will be how deeply OpenAI invests in integrity beyond the launch phase. “KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,” she said.Along with this, the new team will also focus on determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT, an important decision as OpenAI seeks balance monetisation with user trust. Advertisers have also stressed that OpenAI must prove ads embedded in AI answers can deliver measurable results if the company hopes to scale its ad business.An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that a small test of ads will run soon on ChatGPT’s free tier and Go tier in the US. Advertisers must commit to a minimum spend of $200,000 to participate. The company will track clicks and impressions initially, with plans to explore more advanced measurement options as experiments progress.","Openai to focus on scam prevention and kyc systems.

Here's your guide to watch Super Bowl LX without cable

Super Bowl LX is almost here, and fans across the world are searching for one simple thing: how to watch the game live without paying for cable. The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will face off on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The game kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET, with pregame coverage running throughout the day on NBC.Last season, FOX partnered with Tubi to stream Super Bowl LIX for free, but this season, NBC has not confirmed any free livestream for Super Bowl LX. That means most legal options now involve subscription services, free trials, or clever alternatives to watch the action at no direct cost. Here is how viewers in the U.S. and beyond can still tune in without traditional cable.NBC holds the U.S. broadcast rights, so the game will stream on Peacock, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV, DIRECTV Stream, and other platforms that carry NBC. Peacock will simulcast the full game, halftime show, and pregame coverage. However, only Peacock Premium or Premium Plus plans include live sports. The free Peacock tier will not stream the Super Bowl.One of the easiest ways to watch for free is through trial access. YouTube TV often offers a free trial to new users, which includes full access to NBC. If you cancel before the trial ends, you pay nothing. Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV, DIRECTV Stream, Instacart+, and Walmart+ also provide trial offers. Each service sets its own time limits, but when used correctly, they allow fans to stream the game legally without paying.Comcast subscribers with eligible 75 Mbps plans can add Peacock Premium through Xfinity NOW TV. Amazon Prime’s 7-day free trial also allows access to Peacock. These platforms stream in high definition and work across smart TVs, streaming devices, phones, tablets, and browsers.For fans who prefer to watch on the go, the NFL+ app offers live local and prime-time games, including the Super Bowl, on supported phones and tablets. It does not offer a free trial, but it remains one of the most affordable mobile options.In Canada, broadcast rights belong to CTV and TSN. Viewers can watch for free using a digital antenna if CTV is available in their area. DAZN also carries NFL content, though it is a paid service. Some markets may offer limited free broadcasts, while paid platforms such as Sky, Now, and DAZN offer full coverage.","The seattle seahawks and new england patriots will face off on sunday, feb. 8, 2026, at levi’s stadium in santa clara, california.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Thursday. While Nifty50 went below 25,750, BSE Sensex was down over 150 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,723.25, down 53 points or 0.20%. BSE Sensex was at 83,666.28, down 151 points or 0.18%.Stock market analysts expect domestic equities to hold a positive bias, supported by recent trade deals with the US and the European Union, budget-related announcements and ongoing third-quarter earnings.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “There are a few near-term market trends that are significant. The Nifty appears to be in a consolidation phase without big moves at the index level. However, there are big changes within the Nifty stocks with big declines in IT stocks consequent to the IT sell off in the US spreading to India, too. The sell off has been triggered by Anthropic’s new automation tools that the market fears may replace IT services that are presently outsourced. The market fears significant margin pressure for Indian IT companies. What the real impact will be remains to be seen.”“In contrast to the weakness in IT stocks, the large domestic consumption-driven segments are doing well and this is reflected in the resilience of leaders like RIL, Bharti, the banking majors and some auto stocks.After the growth-oriented Budget and trade deals with the EU and US, India’s growth will remain strong facilitating strong domestic consumption. The low-interest rate regime continues to support the growth of the auto sector and is likely to spill over into segments like air conditioners as summer approaches. Therefore, the strong domestic consumption story is likely to sustain the resilience of the domestic consumption- driven stocks. If the cessation of selling and marginal buying by FIIs becomes a trend, the market will gain strength. This is the data point to watch for.""Investor activity reflected the cautious mood, with foreign portfolio investors marginally net buying equities worth Rs 30 crore during the session. Domestic institutional investors also stayed on the buying side, purchasing shares worth Rs 240 crore, according to exchange data.Global cues were mixed, with US stocks ending lower overnight. Wall Street was weighed down by losses in technology counters such as Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir, as concerns grew over elevated valuations and doubts emerged about the sustainability of the AI-led rally. Alphabet shares slipped nearly 2 per cent ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement, though the stock recovered around 2 per cent in after-hours trading after the company signalled a sharp increase in spending to strengthen its position in artificial intelligence.","Nifty50 and bse sensex opened in red on thursday.

I wouldn’t attend this event even if you PAID me $875.

It's pathetic — cheating gets you further than real hard work/achievement ever will.

What’s the theme? Homewrecking and how to shame yourself globally ?

She created the narrative. Way to play victim.

Will there be a Kiss Cam?





The former HR chief caught in last year's viral Coldplay kiss cam scandal is set to return to the spotlight as a keynote speaker at a high-priced crisis communications conference in the United States.Kristin Cabot, the ex-chief people officer of tech firm Astronomer, will speak at PRWeek’s 2026 Crisis Comms Conference in April, where tickets cost $875. Cabot will appear alongside crisis communications specialist Dini von Mueffling, whose firm she hired after the scandal erupted.Cabot is a 53-year-old mother of two who became the centre of drama after she and Astronomer CEO Andy Byron were shown embracing each other on a stadium screen during a Coldplay concert in July 2025, which showed an apparent extramarital affair. Both were married at the time. The footage went viral in moments.The company Astronomer later attempted to defuse the controversy with a bold move, appointing Gwyneth Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, as a temporary company spokesperson in a gag video. Despite the effort, both Cabot and Byron resigned within weeks.Byron has mostly stayed out of public view. Cabot gave several interviews in December, saying she felt a “scarlet letter” (public shame for the sin of adultery) had been placed on her.Now, she is set to address the very topic that created her downfall.According to the conference agenda, Cabot and von Mueffling will lead a 30-minute session titled “Kristin Cabot: Taking back the narrative.” The description says: “Cabot experienced firsthand the extremity of public shaming that women have long experienced when in the negative spotlight of the media, one their male counterparts often seem to avoid.”It adds that Cabot and her PR adviser will share “the strategy — both immediate and long-term — that has helped Cabot take control of her narrative and rewrite her story”.The conference promises attendees tools to “pivot at a moment’s notice for unexpected occurrences that are now the norm, not the exception”. It will take place on April 16 in Washington, DC.The announcement was considered absurd, particularly over the price of entry.

Gallery with café? Artist Daniel Arsham opens new art-driven coffee and dessert restaurant in Dubai Mall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gallery-with-caf-artist-daniel-arsham-opens-new-art-driven-coffee-and-dessert-restaurant-in-dubai-mall/articleshow/127899993.cms,"Daniel's Room Dubai Mall: Art, Coffee and Desserts Fusion in Fashion Avenue

What is Daniel’s Room? More than a café in Dubai Mall



Strategic location of Daniel Arsham's cafe and its cultural relevance







Dubai’s culinary and cultural landscape just got a bold new addition with the launch of Daniel’s Room at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue, a space where specialty coffee, limited-edition desserts and contemporary art coexist under one roof. The concept, created by artist Daniel Arsham, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about openings in the city’s dynamic food and lifestyle scene.Unlike traditional restaurants or dessert spots, Daniel’s Room is designed as an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham, the contemporary artist behind the space. Arsham’s work, known for its exploration of time, erosion and imagined futures, has been integrated into the design of the café itself.The interiors merge sculptural forms and tactile materials to create a setting that feels more like a gallery or architectural installation than a conventional restaurant. This artistic philosophy extends to the menu, which features specialty coffee, pastries, cakes and light bites that have been developed and tested over months to match the same thoughtful, tactile ethos as the space’s design.Part of what makes Daniel’s Room stand out is its hybrid identity of being simultaneously a café, a cultural destination and an art installation. The space includes limited-edition books, collectible objects and custom-designed tableware created exclusively for the venue, not available in galleries or online elsewhere.Unlike typical retail in a shopping mall setting, these collectibles are integrated into the café experience rather than dominating it and encourage visitors to sit, explore the details and return for both the ambience and the edible offerings. Daniel’s Room has been described as a place to “live in, not just visit,” where patrons are encouraged to settle in, enjoy their coffee, peruse art books and absorb the carefully curated aesthetic.Located on Level 2 of Fashion Avenue in one of the world’s busiest retail destinations, Daniel’s Room benefits from high footfall while offering visitors a unique cultural and culinary break from mainstream dining spots in Dubai Mall. Dubai has long become a global hub for innovative culinary concepts and experiential dining, from themed fine-dining restaurants to cafés that elevate coffee culture to an art form and Daniel’s Room fits squarely into this trend, offering something that is both visually compelling and gastronomically satisfying.Daniel’s Room reflects a broader cultural shift where art, lifestyle and daily experiences converge. Rather than confining art to museums or galleries, this concept brings artistic ingenuity into everyday rituals like having a cup of coffee or enjoying a dessert. This approach is not entirely new as iconic creative figures like Gordon Matta-Clark and Damien Hirst have explored restaurant concepts tied to their artistic vision but Daniel’s Room positions this tradition within a contemporary, globally recognised retail and lifestyle context.By integrating sculptural design with carefully considered food and beverage offerings, the space becomes a destination for both locals and tourists seeking more than just a meal; they are seeking an experience that stimulates multiple senses. Daniel’s Room is more than a new café, it represents a blurring of boundaries between food, art and design.By transforming a routine coffee stop into an immersive cultural experience, Daniel Arsham’s latest venture contributes to Dubai’s reputation as a global city where creativity, luxury and everyday life intersect. Whether you are there for the specialty coffee, limited-edition collectibles or simply to soak in the art-infused space, Daniel’s Room offers a fresh way to experience Dubai Mall, not just as a retail hub but as a destination for cultural discovery.","Daniel’s room is an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of daniel arsham.

India hikes duty-free allowance to ₹75,000



The allowance has been raised from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 for most travellers arriving by air or sea.

The higher limit applies to Indian residents, NRIs, people of Indian origin and foreign nationals with valid visas.

Foreign tourists enjoy a separate allowance of ₹25,000.

Airline crew members have a smaller duty-free cap of ₹2,500.

India simplifies gold jewellery rules for the UAE: No value caps



Up to 40g of jewellery for female passengers

Up to 20g for male and other passengers

Other traveller-friendly additions by India for UAE



Laptop exemption: One laptop per passenger above age 18 is fully duty-free, separate from the ₹75,000 cap, making it easier for business and tech travellers.

One laptop per passenger above age 18 is fully duty-free, separate from the ₹75,000 cap, making it easier for business and tech travellers. Pets: Travellers carrying pets have clearer duty-free provisions (subject to prescribed animal import rules).

Travellers carrying pets have clearer duty-free provisions (subject to prescribed animal import rules). Advance and electronic baggage declaration: The new rules allow passengers to declare their baggage digitally using apps or e-services before landing, speeding up customs clearance and reducing queue times at airports.

The new rules allow passengers to declare their baggage digitally using apps or e-services before landing, speeding up customs clearance and reducing queue times at airports. Temporary import and re-import: Clear procedures for temporary imports (such as professional equipment or exhibitions) help avoid unnecessary detention at arrival points.

What UAE travellers should know before flying to India



Pack with the higher duty-free limit in mind: You can bring up to ₹75,000 worth of goods (including electronics, accessories and gifts) without paying duty if arriving by air or sea. Gold shopping is simpler: Carry jewellery up to the specified weight limits without value worries, a big relief for those who buy gold in the UAE before visiting India. Electronics and gadgets are cheaper to bring: Smartphones, watches, cameras and other personal tech will now fall more comfortably within duty-free value caps, reducing unexpected tax at arrival. Digital declarations save time: Use advance electronic baggage declaration systems to reduce processing time and make arrivals smoother. Be aware of exemptions that still apply: Certain items, such as alcohol beyond prescribed volumes, tobacco above limits, firearms, large appliances or goods intended for commercial use, continue to face specific rules and duties under customs laws.





India has introduced a major overhaul of its customs baggage rules for 2026, bringing changes that will significantly benefit international travellers, especially UAE residents, Indian expats (NRIs) and tourists of Indian origin flying into the country. These changes come into effect from February 02, 2026 under the Customs Baggage (Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2026 and a consolidated “Baggage Rules, 2026,” which replace decade-old frameworks and modernise customs procedures at Indian airports.For UAE travellers, a large diaspora that frequently shuttles between India and the Gulf for family, business and leisure, these developments make shopping, carrying personal goods and returning home with prized purchases far easier and more predictable.One of the most impactful changes is the increase in the general duty-free limit that passengers can bring into India without paying customs duty:This increase reflects the government’s recognition that baggage values and travel-shopping patterns have shifted significantly since the previous rule was introduced over a decade ago. This matters for UAE flyers because with the Dirham/Rupee exchange rate and lower prices for many electronics and fashion products in markets like the UAE, the higher duty-free band allows travellers to bring more back home from smartphones and watches to clothing and accessories, without getting hit with import duties at Indian airports.Another welcome reform affects gold jewellery duties, an especially important issue for Indian expats returning from the UAE, where gold shopping is common before trips home. Under the 2026 framework, value-based caps on duty-free gold jewellery have been removed, leaving only weight-based limits.Eligible travellers who have been abroad for more than a year can carry:This applies regardless of the market value of the gold, easing stress from price fluctuations and aligning the rules with contemporary market conditions. Previously, passengers faced both weight and value limits (₹100,000 for women and ₹50,000 for men), which became confusing as gold prices soared over the years. The revised rule removes this complexity and reduces disputes at customs.For many in the UAE’s Indian community, this has been a long-pending demand and the updated rule is seen as a practical and fair resolution that improves compliance and avoids hassles for genuine travellers.The 2026 customs regime streamlines several other baggage categories that directly affect UAE travellers -These enhancements signal a broader shift toward efficiency and passenger convenience in India’s customs processes, aligning with global travel standards.Here are key takeaways for UAE passengers planning trips to India in 2026 -India’s Baggage Rules, 2026 represent one of the most significant updates to its customs framework in nearly a decade by increasing duty-free limits, scrapping outdated value caps on jewellery, streamlining digital procedures and clarifying exemptions. For UAE-based travellers, returning expats and frequent flyers, these reforms mean less worry about customs duties, simpler airport clearance and greater flexibility in carrying purchases home. As international travel resumes full pace and global shopping remains a strong part of travel culture, these new rules help India stay aligned with modern travel expectations and passenger convenience","India's 2026 baggage rules: are uae travellers finally getting a fair deal?

A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","A lawsuit has challenged trump's gold card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners.
