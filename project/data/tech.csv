Our commerce minister Piyush Goyal Ji has assured me that he is trying his best and it will be done. It is just a matter of time,” Radhakrishnan said.He was speaking at an event organised by the Apparel Export Promotion Council to felicitate exporters. The US levied an additional 25 pr cent tariff on India earlier this year, bringing total tariffs to 50per cent. India’s merchandise exports to the US registered over 22 per cent growth in November despite steep tariffs. India’s textile and apparel exports were recorded at $37.75 billion in the last financial year, registering an annual growth of nearly 10 per cent.Radhakrishnan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed at transforming the sector into a “global powerhouse”, with a target of achieving $100 billion in textile exports by 2030, with the apparel sector contributing 40 per cent.He added that India was now facing competition in textiles and apparel from countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Laos, and that FTAs were important to stay ahead. “We tasted success with the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and I am sure we will have another FTA with the European Union soon. I am sure you will be doubling your exports in the next three years,” the Vice President said.",Cp radhakrishnan said the centre was working hard to achieve a trade deal with the us.

SIM-linking stays but government may up auto logout time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sim-linking-stays-but-government-may-up-auto-logout-time/articleshow/126098316.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: While the govt is firm that department of telecommunications' (DoT) Nov 28 direction mandating continuous SIM-binding of messaging apps like WhatsApp is a critical security intervention to check cyber crime and misuse of the apps by foreign intelligence agencies to exfiltrate information from India without traceability, there are indications that it may be open to raising six-hour auto-logout limit for web sessions.The six-hour auto-logout norm - which many messaging apps are resisting on ground that ""logging every 6 hours would cause unacceptable inconvenience"" - is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps.According to DoT directions, the web service instance of mobile apps must log out periodically not later than six hours, allowing users to relink devices via QR code. ""This specifically targets the long session vulnerability used in cross-border scams, forcing periodic re-authentication that proves control of the device and SIM. Most banking and UPI apps successfully use this auto-logout security feature,"" said an official.Also, the argument of messaging apps that SIM binding will force users to buy international roaming services from Indian telecom service providers every time they travel abroad, seems rather flimsy considering the same users are willing to spend liberally on airline tickets and hotels abroad, said an officer.Govt sources said the six-hour auto logout limit for web versions can be revisited and raised to 12 or 18 hours, but not beyond 24 hours.A third objection - that DoT cannot issue directions to apps like WhatsApp as they are covered under the IT Act - is also weak as these apps are hosted on mobile networks run by the telecom service providers who are also the primary Internet service providers.With cyber fraud losses having exceeded Rs 22,800 crore in 2024 and some defrauded persons being driven to suicide, govt agencies are unanimous that DoT directions are ""proportionate measures to prevent misuse of telecom identifiers, ensure traceability & protect citizens' trust in India's digital eco-system"".Officials said the DOT direction followed warnings from security establishment, with National Security Council Secretariat having raised the issue in Dec 2024 along with directions to DoT to study SIM-binding requirements for instant messaging applications.MHA formed a technical sub-group in Sept 2024 comprising members from DoT, Delhi Police, MHA, MeitY, IB and TRAI, which recommended binding social media and OTT services to mobile numbers. In April 2025, MHA directed IT intermediaries to implement the technical measures including SIM binding and geo-fencing for communication apps like WhatsApp, to mitigate cybercrime threats.""DoT field units too independently echoed these concerns with law enforcement agencies. Also, cellular operators association of India requested SIM binding implementation in Aug 2025, to surb cross-border frauds and ensure national security,"" a security official told TOI Saturday.","The six-hour auto-logout norm is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps. Many messaging apps are resisting on ground that ""logging every 6 hours would cause unacceptable inconvenience"" the argument of messaging apps that sim binding will force users to buy international roaming services from indian telecom service providers seems rather flimsy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126098318,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-780272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

The following section takes a detailed look at all the known information about the Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake.While the project related to Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake has moved into full production, Remedy has not yet locked in a specific release date.

They will likely be maintaining the iconic hard-boiled narration that made the original games a cult classic. This partnership between Remedy and Rockstar ensures that the remake will honor the original's legacy while delivering a wonderful experience.This was all you needed to know about Max Payne 1 & 2 Remake.

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Paul Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like celebrity net worth, paul heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force.

With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

A source for Mike Florio of NBC Sports said Worthy’s car was stolen from a residential garage by a professional group of criminals who “knew exactly what they were doing.” Xavier was not in the car when it was taken and was unharmed; there was no carjacking. Only a month had passed since the Chiefs drafted him in the first round when his car was stolen. As of late 2025, there have reportedly been no public reports indicating that Worthy ever recovered his stolen car. Cut to the present: through his TikTok pages, Worthy reportedly owns four cars costing over $1 million. Let’s find out which are those.According to Spotrac, Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in June 2024. Worthy is reportedly known for owning expensive cars purchased with his rookie contract:The no-longer-a-rookie wide receiver has been seen arriving at Kansas City Chiefs games in a sleek, matte black Rolls-Royce Phantom, which reportedly costs more than $500,000.In a TikTok video, he was seen posing in front of a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. The US Sun reported in March 2025 that Worthy drove a Dodge Charger in college.On another TikTok page, he was seen posing in front of a shiny black Mercedes SUV.In March, Daily Athlete reported on Instagram that Worthy owns several other luxury cars, including a Bugatti. Xavier will make $800,000 after taxes in the 2025 season.J. Arturo Trujillo of Marca reported in March that instead of purchasing an expensive car, Worthy decided to customize his garage. He filled the place with key moments from his football career: huge photos of him with the Chiefs, time spent at the University of Texas, and a record-breaking performance at the NFL Combine. The garage floor had a striking bluish-black abstract art and featured “Chosen 1,” reflecting Worthy’s unique playing style. CH Customs helped with the customization. Xavier shared a video of his revamped garage on TikTok, and it quickly gained a lot of recognition.Also Read: Xavier Worthy: Rising Star, Super Bowl Hopes, Career Highlights, and More","Xavier worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in june 2024.

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt says the 15-pound gain came from muscle, recovery, and long-term planning

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shares structured workouts, consistency advice, and public appearance at AmericaFest 2025

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt is not playing into the optics game. She is controlling the message herself.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week, openly revealing that she gained about 15 pounds over the past year. The admission was not framed as a setback. It was framed as progress. Hunt said the change came from intentional training, metabolic reset, and a shift away from appearance-driven goals.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt positioned the transformation as a long-term commitment to strength and sustainability. Her post focused on how her body performed, how her energy stabilized, and how patience replaced pressure.“My 2025 fitness goal was simple: become the strongest version of myself, inside and out,” she wrote.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made it clear that the year was not about restarting or chasing fast results. She said her approach changed once she prioritized training with intention and respecting recovery.“This year wasn’t about starting over. It was about getting smarter. Training with intention, thinking long-term, and learning that strength, balance, and longevity matter more than chasing quick results. I learned that recovery isn’t optional, it’s part of the work.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt later addressed the weight change directly and explained how it happened.“I reset my metabolism, fueled my body on purpose, and slowly recomposed, adding about 15 lbs of muscle since I began this journey.”She added that she stopped centering progress around appearance. Instead, she focused on how her body felt day to day, when to push, and when to pause. Hunt said the result was steadier energy and sharper focus as the year progressed.The post was paired with workout clips and set to music by The Weeknd, reinforcing the message without changing its tone. Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt closed the post by stating she ended the year stronger than she began it.Earlier in the week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a separate post labeled “Training Tuesday,” showing an upper-body workout performed outdoors with dumbbells and a mat.“Upper body strength doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a mat, and a commitment to show up,” she wrote.“Focus on controlled reps, strong posture, and breathing with intention,quality always beats quantity.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt also advised followers to keep workouts simple and repeatable, especially on busy days. She encouraged starting small rather than skipping sessions entirely.Later that week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt attended Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix. The event runs Dec. 18–21 at the Phoenix Convention Center and honors the legacy of Charlie Kirk, with programming led by his widow Erika Kirk. Hunt shared brief glimpses of the event on social media.While the Kansas City Chiefs continue to navigate an uneven close to the season under owner Clark Hunt, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt ended 2025 on her own terms. She defined success by strength gained, habits built, and consistency maintained.“Finishing the year stronger than I started, and remembering that growth never really ends.”","Chiefs heiress gracie hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week.

Asmongold and Wendy Ortiz have had enough with the tipping obsession





Popular Kick streamer Asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding Wendy Ortiz's sister, Evelyn Ortiz’s recent encounter with a waitress. The controversy began after a short clip from Ortiz’s IRL livestream spread rapidly across X and Reddit. The video showed a waitress confronting Ortiz for leaving a $5 tip on a $250 bill. Despite Evelyn trying to prevent any unnecessary conflict, the waitress was less than impressed at the act.Asmongold addressed the whole awkward situation, criticizing tipping culture as a whole. The streamer called it a side effect of slavery and a form of abuse that should not be entertained. Ortiz also reflected on the incident, calling out how one should not be upset at the amount they got tipped.Reacting to Evelyn’s video, Asmongold wrote on X, “Tipping, a side effect from slavery, is a psyop created by the business ruling class to pit the middle class against the working class. Engaging in tip-shaming or forms of social compliance to continue tipping works solely to continue this abuse. Never tip if you don't want to.""Wendy Ortiz later addressed the situation directly, offering a more personal perspective shaped by her own experience.She pushed back on the idea that tips should be expected or demanded, saying, ""As a waitress/waiter, I don't think you can expect a tip and be, like, upset at what they got tipped.""At the same time, she made it clear she does believe in and advocate for the need to tip when services are good and even often reminds others to do so. Wendy also pointed out how unusual the US tipping culture can feel compared to other countries, where people get offended and become unnecessarily rude when they are not tipped.This latest news comes in light of Wendy Ortiz’s recent public clash with FaZe Clan member Rani “Stable Ronaldo” earlier this month, where she called him a woman-hater. Although Asmongold was not a fan of her comments then, he now comes to the defense of her sister, who got embroiled in an unnecessary conflict.Also read: Wendy Ortiz apologizes after calling Stable Ronaldo a “woman hater”","Kick streamer asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding wendy ortiz's sister, evelyn ortiz's recent encounter with a waitress.

He revealed on The Joe Rogan Experience that his mantra is to run Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business,"" a mindset forged by past near-death experiences.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen huang, ceo of $4.4 trillion ai chip giant nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.
