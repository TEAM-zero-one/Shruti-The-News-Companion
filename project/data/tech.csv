DA, DR hike cheer! The Cabinet has approved a 3% hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) for working and retired central government employees on Wednesday. The move will benefit 49 lakh central government employees and 69 lakh pensioners. , Information & Broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The hike will be effective July 1, 2025 and will cost Rs 10,084 crore. ""This increase is in accordance with the accepted formula, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission,"" the Cabinet release said.As the festival of Diwali nears, employees and pensioners of the Central Government in India had been anticipating an announcement regarding the DA and DR increment.Although such revisions typically coincide with major festivals to support employees with rising expenses, there has been a slight delay in the notification this year.The government implements biannual revisions of DA and DR, essential elements of government compensation and pensions, in January and July. These hikes are designed to protect employees and pensioners from the effects of inflation and help maintain their standard of living.According to an ET report, the 3 percent hike in DA, DR would contribute Rs 540 to the monthly earnings of staff receiving minimum basic pay of Rs 18,000 under the 7th Pay Commission , resulting in a total of Rs 28,440. For pensioners with Rs 9,000 minimum pension, the increase would add Rs 270, elevating their total pension to Rs 14,220 at the new 58 percent rate.Source: ETCentral government employees' DA calculation relies on the most recent Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW). Monthly CPI-IW figures are released by the Labour Bureau, which operates under the Labour Ministry. A specific formula exists for computing the Dearness Allowance applicable to central government staff and retirees.The Union Cabinet has already given its approval for railway employees' performance-linked bonus.The Confederation of Central Government Employees and Workers (CCGEW) had raised concerns about the delay, pointing out that the customary schedule of announcing in late September and disbursing arrears in early October has not been followed.The government implemented a 2 percent increase in DA/DR during March 2025, which took effect from January 1. This adjustment elevated the rate to 55 percent, benefiting employees and pensioners with additional financial support amidst rising costs.","Cabinet has approved a 3% hike in dearness allowance (da) and dearness relief (dr) for working and retired central government employees.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has reportedly laid off thousands of employees across the globe in the past three months. During earnings call, the company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. It further added that it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.During the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills. ‚ÄúWe are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need. And, we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI in order to create more investment capacity,‚Äù Accenture CEO said.At the end of August, Accenture‚Äôs global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. ""In FY26, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business,"" said Julie Sweet. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company. Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls ‚Äúrapid talent rotation.‚Äù ""Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1, for a total of approximately $865 million over the period. The business optimization program has two parts. One related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost-savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business,"" he said.While trimming roles that don‚Äôt align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. ‚ÄúAdvanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,‚Äù Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as ‚Äúdeflationary‚Äù but ‚Äúexpansionary. ‚ÄùDespite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‚Äëon‚Äëyear revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June‚ÄìAugust quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture‚Äôs ‚Äúunique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.‚ÄùIt is quite clear that Accenture‚Äôs restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Tesla owner Elon Musk has set a new record, becoming the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion. The surge comes on the back of a rebound in Tesla‚Äôs stock and soaring valuations of his other ventures, including SpaceX and xAI.Forbes‚Äô billionaires index put Musk‚Äôs net worth at $500.1 billion as of 4:15 PM ET on Wednesday. Much of that wealth is tied to Tesla, where he holds more than a 12.4% stake, Reuters reported.The electric carmaker‚Äôs stock has climbed over 14% this year and rose 3.3% on Wednesday alone, adding more than $6 billion to his fortune.Tesla shares have bounced back after a shaky start to the year, with investors encouraged by Musk‚Äôs renewed attention to his companies. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm noted last month that Musk was now back ‚Äúfront and center‚Äù at the firm after several months spent at the White House.Musk showed his commitment days later by buying about $1 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a strong show of faith in the company‚Äôs future as it pushes beyond cars towards AI and robotics.Still, challenges remain. Weak car sales and pressure on profit margins have left Tesla lagging behind its peers in the so-called ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù group of tech giants.Even so, the company‚Äôs board has proposed a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, tying the deal to ambitious growth and operational goals while also addressing his demands for a larger stake, according to Reuters.Beyond Tesla, Musk‚Äôs other firms have been on the rise. His AI startup xAI was last valued at $75 billion in July, according to Pitchbook.Earlier in September, CNBC reported that it could seek a $200 billion valuation in future fundraising, though Musk insisted it was not raising money at the time. His rocket company SpaceX has also been in talks to sell insider shares, with Bloomberg reporting a potential valuation of around $400 billion.Oracle founder Larry Ellison trails Musk as the world‚Äôs second-richest person, with a fortune estimated at $350.7 billion as of Wednesday.","Elon musk is the first person ever to build a fortune of almost $500 billion.

H-1B visa changes: What Pipeshift CEO said about using O-1 visa



""If push comes to shove and we have to go down that route, I don't think a $100,000 will affect us too much after a Series A or a Series B. That's negligible compared to all the payroll and salaries that you manage at that point,‚Äù

‚ÄúSeed stage companies don't hire more than five or six people. If you're hiring five or six people, two or three of them are just founders. For one or two of them, you can probably get grads, and you can get people who are already here or on OPT status,‚Äù

What people misunderstand is that the best talent and most of the tech world does not run on H-1B alone. The US won't lose out on good quality AI talent because there's no better place in the world that has this density of talent, speed of development in AI, customer discovery in AI, and venture capital and money flowing in.""

H-1B visa changes may affect US tech companies and startups. Yet, Arko Chattopadhyay, the Indian-origin Pipeshift and co-founder of the Bay Area-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup Pipeshift, said that the new fee won‚Äôt change his plans to hire up to 10 new employees in 2026. In a recent interview, Chattopadhyay noted that if he fails to find the top talent he needs in the US, he may explore other pathways to access it. The AI startup founder isn't worried that the new $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa will kill the startup world. Even though many founders have warned that the steep price hike would make it impossible to hire skilled foreign workers, he thinks he can recruit top talent. He explained that he can hire people who already live in the US or hire top talent from other countries to work remotely, giving them a special subsidy.In an interview with Business Insider, Chattopadhyay said:Pipeshift CEO explained that while H-1B visa changes pose challenges, the startup‚Äôs founders are in the US on O-1 visas, which recognise ‚Äúextraordinary ability‚Äù in fields like science and business.Founded in 2024 and backed by Y Combinator, Pipeshift has employees in both the US and India.The company is hiring two US-based staff members, including an OPT candidate who may later qualify for an O-1 visa due to their strong research credentials. Arko noted that most young graduates, especially developers or software engineers, may struggle to meet the O-1 requirements because they lack the publications and citations needed for such visas.Chattopadhyay added.He admitted that startups will face the brunt of the higher visa fees due to limited cash flow, but added that the impact may be less severe than feared, as most startups hire few people and post-Series A companies can absorb costs for top talent.the AI startup founder noted.He also claimed that the H-1B fee hike won‚Äôt harm the US talent pipeline but will ensure that only the highest-skilled workers have access to the program.Highlighting that much of the talent enters the US through L-1 visas, which are intended for intra-company, he explained: ""","Pipeshift co-founder arko chattopadhyay says he can hire top talent from other countries to work remotely, giving them a special subsidy.

Understanding how UAE fuel prices are set

Tips to save on fuel in 2025





The UAE Fuel Price Committee has announced the fuel prices for October 2025, reflecting a slight increase across all fuel types compared to September. These adjustments align with global oil market trends and are part of the UAE's monthly review process to keep domestic fuel prices in line with international rates.These price changes are determined based on the average global price of oil and are applicable across all Emirates, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and others. The UAE's approach to fuel pricing ensures that residents and businesses experience consistent and transparent fuel costs. For people commuting daily to work, school, or errands, the small price hike may feel noticeable at the pump. Middle-class and lower-income residents can manage costs by:The recent increase in UAE fuel prices for October 2025 is closely linked to trends in the global oil market, which plays a major role in determining local fuel costs. Factors such as international supply and demand, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions, and fluctuations in crude oil prices all have a direct impact on the rates residents pay at the pump. For example, disruptions in major oil-exporting countries or unexpected changes in production can quickly drive up global prices, which then filter down to domestic markets. Additionally, seasonal demand spikes, such as increased travel during holidays, can also influence pricing.By understanding these global dynamics, everyday commuters and middle-class families can better anticipate changes and plan their monthly fuel budgets more effectively, rather than being caught off guard by sudden hikes.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices. This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions. Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates, typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.Looking to keep more dirhams in your pocket while filling up? Think of it as fuel-saving hacks for everyday heroes. First, carpooling like a boss sharing rides with friends or colleagues not only saves cash but also gives you some gossip time on the road. Next, combine your errands; that extra trip to the supermarket? Toss it in with the school run. Drive like a Zen master gentle acceleration, smooth braking, and no sudden sprints can stretch every litre farther. Don‚Äôt forget your car needs TLC too; proper tire pressure and timely servicing mean your engine sips fuel, not gulps it. And if you really want to be clever, fill up during off-peak hours, so you avoid long queues and unnecessary idling.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban‚Äôs first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban‚Äôs supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that ‚Äúeight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars‚Äù would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place ‚Äúuntil further notice.‚ÄùJust last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan‚Äôs fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide ‚Äúto prevent immoral activities.‚Äù They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: ‚ÄúWhile overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ‚Äù","Analysis of data by hamptons shows that indian investors are followed by nigerians, poles and irish.

While gambling is broadly prohibited under UAE law, a tightly regulated system of raffles, prize draws, and lotteries exists‚Äîand yes, in many cases, foreigners and non-residentslegally participate. From airport raffles to million-dirham prize draws, here's a comprehensive breakdown of what‚Äôs allowed, what‚Äôs not, and how global participants can engage with UAE-based lottery platforms.Gambling, in all its forms, is illegal in the United Arab Emirates, based on Islamic law which underpins the country‚Äôs legal framework. Article 355 of the UAE Penal Code criminalizes participation in any form of gambling‚Äîwhether in-person or online‚Äîwith penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both.However, there are specific, regulated exceptions. Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 (as amended) allows licensed companies to conduct raffles, lucky draws, and lottery-style events under strict oversight. These are not classified as gambling when operated under approved guidelines and are usually tied to promotional campaigns, charitable efforts, or licensed commercial incentives.The Ministry of Economy is responsible for authorizing these operators. Only those entities officially licensed can offer such draws, and their operations must be compliant with the regulations set out by the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA).Participation eligibility varies by platform. Some UAE-based draws are open to anyone globally, while others are strictly for UAE residents with valid documentation.It‚Äôs essential that non-resident participants:As of October 2025, here is a detailed look at the UAE‚Äôs major legal lottery and raffle platforms, their eligibility requirements, and global accessibility:These are not traditional lotteries, but reward-based draws tied to financial products. Participation typically requires:Participating in UAE-based lotteries as a foreigner or non-resident is legal only through licensed and government-authorized platforms. To avoid legal complications or financial loss, participants must adhere to the following guidelines:The UAE‚Äôs General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA) oversees legal raffle and lottery operations. Any draw, platform, or seller not explicitly licensed or regulated under GCGRA or the Ministry of Economy should be avoided. Unauthorized websites or third-party vendors may not only be illegal but could also result in scams or invalid entries.Some platforms, like Emirates Draw, have undergone regulatory changes and periodic updates. For example, although currently open to international participants, certain features or eligibility requirements may be paused or revised in the future. Always check the most recent participation criteria, prize claim rules, and refund policies directly from the official source.Even if UAE law permits your entry into a lottery or raffle, the laws in your own country may impose restrictions on foreign lottery participation, impose taxes on winnings, or ban cross-border gaming altogether. Always ensure your participation complies with your local financial, tax, and gaming regulations.While UAE-based lottery platforms typically do not charge tax on winnings, you may be liable to declare and pay tax in your own country, depending on its tax code. Additionally, payment processing or currency conversion fees might apply during online purchases. Carefully review the fee structures and prize claim conditions before participating.Minimum age for participation is 18 years across all legal platforms. Some platforms (like the official UAE Lottery) also require you to enable location services in your browser or app to verify physical presence within the UAE borders.","Foreigners worldwide can legally join uae draws like big ticket and dubai duty free.

In a move that underscores the UAE's commitment to future-ready governance, a new fellowship initiative has been launched to equip Emirati professionals with deep expertise in economic strategy, international policy, and artificial intelligence. The programme, developed in partnership with leading global universities, marks a major investment in national talent and government transformation.Mohammed bin Abdullah Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs, announced the launch of a national fellowship initiative aimed at empowering Emirati professionals working in government entities across the UAE. The programme is designed to prepare a new generation of public sector leaders capable of advancing economic growth, driving digital transformation, and shaping data-driven, innovative public policies.Al Gergawi emphasised that this initiative is grounded in the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai.

The selection of universities was based on the 2026 global university rankings and a thorough assessment of their track records in leadership training.The partner universities and allocated fellows for the first phase are as follows:This brings the total to 200 fellows, all of whom are high-potential Emirati professionals nominated by government entities across the UAE.

The shutdown of the US government has begun‚Äì there is no immediate clarity on the duration of the shutdown. Russel T. Vought, director, executive office of the President, on Sept 30, sent a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies, stating: ‚Äú‚Ä¶As such, affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown. ‚Äù‚ÄúIt is unclear how long Democrats will maintain their untenable position, making the duration of the shutdown difficult to predict. Regards, employees should report to work for their next regulatory scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities. We will issue another memorandum indicating that government functions should resume once the President has signed a bill providing for appropriations,‚Äù added the memo.Based on a fact sheet issued by the American Immigration lawyers Association (AILA) and views of immigration attorneys, TOI decoded what a US government shutdown means for the immigration process and how key agencies that cater to immigration activities will be impacted.The visa and passport operations will remain open, however, depending on how long the shutdown lasts, work might become limited to diplomatic visas and life-or-death emergencies, stated AILA.Ports of entry will remain also open; however, applications that are filed at the border may be impacted, it added.‚ÄúWhile visa and passport services generally continue (as these are fee funded). If local fee reserves are depleted, posts may scale back to emergency or diplomatic cases only,‚Äù states Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney. ‚ÄúPlan consular-linked travel, such as where a visa is required, with a buffer as consulates may reduce services during a prolonged shutdown‚Äù he cautioned.USCIS will remain open as it does not rely on Congress for its funding ‚Äì but on fees collected by it. The few programs that are funded by Congress may be impacted by a government shutdown, stated AILA. According to Tripathi, ‚ÄúUSCIS will continue its core services, accepting visa petitions, biometrics, interviews and premium processing. However, it would suspend those programs that are funded via appropriations -such as E-verify. ‚ÄùForm I-9 is a U.S. government form that all employers must complete to verify the identity and work authorization of anyone they hire. E-Verify is an online system run by the US government that lets employers electronically confirm the work authorization of new hires by comparing I-9 information to federal databases. ‚ÄúEmployers should rely on the alternate remote I-9 document review process when E-Verify is unavailable,‚Äù said Tripathi.DOL‚Äôs Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) will stop all operations during a government shutdown, stated AILA.Labour condition applications (LCAs) are required for H-1B filings ‚Äì this means that employers cannot file a new H-1B application which requires a fresh LCA. PERM is the ‚ÄòPermanent Labor Certification process‚Äô, where the employer sponsoring the green card must prove that there are no qualified US workers for this specific job. Prevailing wage determination must be done before the PERM process.‚ÄúThe FLAG online portal will go offline. Employers will be unable to file LCAs, PERM applications, or prevailing-wage requests, and no certifications will be issued,‚Äù points out Tripathi.‚ÄúWhile USCIS will keep processing H-1B and green-card applications, any part of these filings that requires prior Labour Department action ‚Äî such as approved LCAs or prevailing-wage determinations ‚Äî will be stuck until the shutdown ends,‚Äù said Elissa Taub, partner at Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm.According to AILA, ICE enforcement and removal operations will continue. ICE attorneys will typically focus on the cases of detained individuals.

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday announced the launch of a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, as part of a deal with Pfizer to offer prescription drugs directly to consumers at discounted prices. The initiative, aimed at cutting healthcare costs, is expected to grow with more deals from other drugmakers in the coming months.The new website is part of a broader push to align US drug prices with those in other developed nations, a strategy known as ‚Äúmost-favored-nation‚Äù pricing. Under the deal, Pfizer agreed to offer the same prices for new drugs in both the US and other advanced markets.‚ÄúThe United States is done subsidizing the health care of the rest of the world,‚Äù Trump said in a press conference. ""They put all of that on us, and yet they were the beneficiaries too. So it's been changed.""A senior administration official said Tuesday that the TrumpRx site, set to launch in early 2026, will not directly sell or distribute medications. Instead, consumers will be able to search for their prescriptions and be redirected to drugmakers‚Äô direct-to-consumer platforms, as cited by CNN.Pfizer said most of its primary care drugs will be offered through TrumpRx, though it did not specify which ones.The company also announced plans to invest an additional $70 billion (¬£52 billion) in US manufacturing, research, and development.""We now have the certainty and stability we need on two critical fronts, tariffs and pricing,‚Äù Pfizer‚Äôs chief executive, Albert Bourla, said, as reported by the BBC.According to a company press release, direct-to-consumer prices for Pfizer drugs on TrumpRx.gov will average 50 percent lower. However, key details on how those discounts were determined were not provided. ‚ÄúSpecific terms of the agreement remain confidential,‚Äù the release stateThe administration on Tuesday clarified that ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù pricing is based on a drug‚Äôs net price, including discounts and rebates, compared with the lowest price in other wealthy countries such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark. This lowest international price then serves as the benchmark for US pricing.Pfizer, the first drugmaker to fully meet the demands outlined in Trump‚Äôs July letter to industry CEOs, plans to offer Medicaid ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù pricing starting in early 2026, with the president indicating other companies may follow.Trump has often highlighted that Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs than people in other developed nations, especially in Europe, where governments frequently set prices. A Health and Human Services report last year found US drug prices to be nearly three times higher than in comparable countries. During his first term, Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a ‚ÄúMost Favored Nation‚Äù pricing policy to address the gap.","The new website is part of a broader push to align us drug prices with those in other developed nations.

NEW DELHI: As companies from the EFTA Bloc ‚Äî Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein ‚Äî promised investment into India as part of the $100 billion commitment under the trade deal, Swiss state secretary for economic affairs Helene Budliger Artieda called for the need for a bilateral investment treaty(BIT), while Liechtenstein sought a double taxation avoidance agreement.At an event to mark the implementation of the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), pharma giant Roche Holding committed to invest $1.8 billion into its core business over the next five years. There were at least 18 other companies that committed to invest in India over the next three-five years.While a trade deal was finalised around 18 months ago, BIT has been held up as the finance ministry has so far not agreed to make changes to the model treaty, which is not acceptable to most countries.But that has not stopped companies in the four EFTA countries from seeking to invest more in return for India offering lower or zero duty import of most items from the trading bloc, including Swiss chocolates and watches.While TEPA includes a commitment from the bloc for investments of $100 billion in India over 15 years, commerce minister Piyush Goyal said he had received assurances of another $150 billion in investments, but after the finalisation of data exclusivity in India‚Äôs IP laws.‚ÄúGiven robust intellectual property laws and enforcement in India‚Ä¶ we are hoping to attract much more than that,‚Äù he said.He argued that it is the first trade agreement to incorporate a firm investment commitment, helping balance the interests and ensuring fairness between partners.The minister described the pact as a ‚Äútrusted partnership between friends‚Äù at a time of global trade turbulence. ‚ÄúIt signifies a solid vote of confidence between the four-nation EFTA and India, between the businesses of our five countries. It signals new beginnings, happy tidings and huge opportunity for businesses on both sides,‚Äù he said.As part of the agreement, India is offering duty concessions on 82.7% products, covering 95.3% of EFTA exports.

MUMBAI: RBI has taken a series of steps to bolster consumer protection in the financial sector, starting with a move that makes access to digital banking a basic entitlement for holders of Jan Dhan and other no-frills accounts.RBI said it will review the framework for basic accounts, which are offered without minimum balance requirements, to ensure they keep pace with changing customer needs. This is aimed at making such accounts ‚Äî key for financial inclusion ‚Äî more affordable and digitally enabled.In a parallel step to safeguard depositors, the central bank announced that the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) will shift to a risk-based premium framework. This will encourage stronger banks to adopt sounder practices, while reinforcing the safety net for depositors in case of bank failures. For grievance redressal, RBI proposed significant strengthening of the internal ombudsman (IO) mechanism within regulated entities. IOs will be empowered to award compensation and directly interact with complainants.","Rbi has taken a series of steps to bolster consumer protection in the financial sector.
