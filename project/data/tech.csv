If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.","The ghibli-style photo trend is taking over feeds everywhere.

Elon Musk’s xAI acquires X social media platform in a 33 billion dollar mega deal: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-xai-acquires-x-social-media-platform-in-a-33-billion-dollar-mega-deal-report/articleshow/119687915.cms,"Musk’s xAI acquires X to merge AI and social media

Musk’s xAI expands AI dominance with Grok-3 and Colossus

Integration of X and xAI: Strategic implications

Financial and regulatory considerations

Musk’s expanding influence

In a major corporate merger, Elon Musk 's AI company, xAI , has purchased X, the social media site previously known as Twitter, for $33 billion. The purchase is the latest high-profile action by Musk, who already controls Tesla and SpaceX. The transaction is an all-stock merger that tightens Musk's grip on X and helps him advance AI technologies, including his chatbot system, Grok.Musk announced the acquisition via a post on X, stating that the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for debt adjustments. The merger is expected to integrate the vast data resources of X with xAI’s AI models and computational power, potentially giving xAI an advantage in the increasingly competitive AI market. But the details of the deal, such as investor compensation, employee impact, and regulatory issues, are still unknown. The takeover also raises concerns about privacy, data protection, and the future of both platforms.The announcement of xAI’s acquisition of X follows Musk’s long-term vision of integrating AI with social media platforms. In his post, Musk emphasized that the futures of xAI and X are ""intertwined,"" highlighting plans to combine data, AI models, computational power, and distribution networks.Industry analysts have described the move as both strategic and expected. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, noted that the acquisition appears to be a culmination of Musk’s plans for X. Meanwhile, D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Gil Luria pointed out that the transaction’s valuation—$45 billion before debt adjustments—is significant because it surpasses the original $44 billion Musk paid to take Twitter private in 2022.Musk’s deep involvement in both xAI and X allowed him to execute the acquisition without seeking external investor approval. According to insiders, Musk informed investors that the two companies had already been collaborating closely and that the integration would enhance the development of xAI’s AI models.Founded in 2023, xAI has quickly positioned itself as a competitor in the artificial intelligence market. It recently raised $10 billion in funding, valuing the company at $75 billion. xAI is directly competing with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT , and has been working to develop increasingly sophisticated AI models.In February 2025, xAI introduced Grok-3, its latest AI model, as it seeks to rival OpenAI and other AI firms such as China’s DeepSeek. The company has also been investing in expanding its computational resources, with its ""Colossus"" supercomputer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee, being among the largest AI training facilities in the world.Musk has been engaged in legal battles with OpenAI, suing the company over its transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit model. A federal judge recently denied Musk’s request for an injunction to halt OpenAI’s restructuring, further intensifying competition between the two AI firms.The merger between xAI and X represents a broader strategy by Musk to leverage the social media platform’s vast user-generated data for AI development. X, with its real-time data streams, user interactions, and media content, provides xAI with an extensive dataset that can be used to refine and train its AI models.By integrating AI directly into X, Musk could transform the platform into a hub for AI-driven content moderation, personalized recommendations, and enhanced user interactions. Furthermore, the ability to distribute xAI’s AI products through X could provide a competitive advantage over rival AI companies that rely on standalone applications.The acquisition raises several financial and regulatory questions. Following Musk’s 2022 takeover of Twitter, X experienced a turbulent period marked by massive layoffs and advertiser withdrawals. However, recent improvements in its operational performance and renewed advertiser interest have made X a more attractive asset.The banks that originally provided $13 billion in loans for Musk’s Twitter acquisition managed to offload the debt to investors, reflecting increased market confidence in X’s long-term viability. Analysts believe that investors who purchased the debt could see significant returns due to the company’s improving financial performance and integration with xAI.Despite these developments, the deal could face regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding concerns over monopolization and data privacy. Merging a major social media platform with an AI company raises questions about how user data will be utilized and whether the integration could lead to unfair competitive advantages.Beyond the business realm, Musk’s growing influence in Washington, D.C., could play a role in shaping regulatory responses to the acquisition. As head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been involved in advising the U.S. government on cost-cutting measures, potentially giving him leverage in policy discussions affecting his business empire.Musk’s extensive portfolio, which now includes Tesla, SpaceX, X, xAI, and Neuralink, positions him as one of the most powerful figures in technology and business. The acquisition of X by xAI represents another step in his broader vision of integrating AI with social media, automation, and space exploration.","Musk's ai company, xai, has purchased x, the social media site previously known as twitter, for $33 billion.

Design exchange keeps relations alive: Pak designer

Pak imprint in men’s designs

The men’s section is the ‘shalwar kameez’

LUCKNOW: Fashion knows no boundaries and connects people globally through shared aesthetics and cultural expressions. Given the massive fan following of Pakistani TV dramas in Lucknow, the intricate thread work, delicate embellishments, and flowing silhouette characteristic of Pakistani fashion are influencing local clothing preferences.For a long time, the designs worn by actors in popular Pakistani serials like ‘Humsafar’, ‘Noor Jahan’, ‘Zindagi Gulzar Hai’ and ‘Shehr-e-Zaat’ have caught the viewers’ fancy till the trade got affected by political turmoil.But now, boutiques, tailors, and embroiderers in Nakhas, Chowk, Gole Market, Aliganj and Aminabad are flooded with requests to replicate Pakistani designs in stunning ‘shararas’, ‘gharara’ fits and royal ‘Anarkalis’. The most soughtafter designs include straight-cut ‘kurtas’ with detailed necklines, palazzo trousers with subtle motifs, and dupattas featuring elaborate borders.Many boutiques have adapted these styles to suit local tastes while maintaining the essence of Pakistani craftsmanship. Local craftsmen have mastered techniques like shadow work, mirror work, and ‘zari’ embroidery to meet the growing demand.Fashion enthusiasts particularly appreciate the subtle colour combinations and sophisticated styling that Pakistani outfits offer. The emphasis on quality fabric and comfortable fits has made these designs popular for both casual wear and formal occasions.As Rubaab alias Raabi battles a conflict of heart, eyes filled with tears, Shefali Tandon and Ankita Sharma who are watching the Pakistani TV drama ‘Diyar e Yaar’, in Lucknow can’t help but admire the salwar suit the actor is wearing in the scene.“The muted elegance of the attires of these actresses is irresistible,” says Shefali, adding, be it the character of a rich girl or a middleclass or even less privileged one, all ac-tresses are seen in the most tasteful of attires. Talking to TOI, Mumtaz Bano, a boutique owner in Nakhas, says: “Despite limited direct imports, social media and television shows continue to showcase new Pakistani fashion trends. We study these trends carefully to create similar aesthetics to cater to the growing demand. In fact, we have developed our signature styles by blending Pakistani elements with regional preferences. The result is a unique fusion that appeals to fashion-conscious customers.”Mohammad Shoeb, a tailor in Aminabad, says: “Customers often bring screenshots from Pakistani dramas, requesting similar outfits. The demand spans across age groups, with younger customers particularly drawn to contemporary interpretations of traditional designs. The popularity has led to specialised tailoring units focusing solely on Pakistani-inspired fashion.” He said suits worn by actors in recent series like ‘Ghair’, ‘Meem se Mohabbat’ and ‘Jafaa’ are a rage among followers.These traditional ensembles are locally tailored rather than imported from Pakistan, making them costeffective. ‘Anarkali’ suits begin at Rs 1,500, while ‘shararas’ and ‘ghararas’ are priced at Rs 2,000 upwards. The final price tag largely depends on one’s ability to negotiate.The enduring appeal of Pakistani fashion lies in its blend of tradition and contemporary style. The designs remain relevant across seasons and occasions, makingthem a practical choice for fashionconscious consumers.“As cultural exchanges continue through media and entertainment, this influence on local fashion is likely to evolve further,” says Mihir Daswani, a showroom owner in Aliganj. Interestingly, the influence of Pakistani dramas extends beyond just clothing to accessories and styling as well. Matching footwear, jewellery, and bags completing the look are equally sought after. This has created opportunities for local artisans to experiment with new design elements while maintaining traditional craftsmanship.The trend has also influenced wedding wear, with many brides choosing Pakistani-inspired ensembles for their trousseau. The elegant simplicity of these designs, combined with sophisticated embellishments, offers a refreshing alternative to traditional wedding wear. Boutiques often create customised collections incorporating these elements for wedding seasons.Local weekly markets have also adapted to this demand by stocking suitable fabrics and embellishments. Textile merchants from Kanpur who set up makeshift shops in Gole Market’s Buddh Bazaar regularly include materials commonly used in Pakistani outfits in their inventory. This has made it easier for tailors and boutiques to create authentic-looking designs atWhat is it that goes into the design of these suits that have made them so popular? “It is primarily the choice of fabric as we give importance to the comfort it offers according to the season,” says fashion designer Yasmin Zaman , based in Karachi, Pakistan.“The right fabric gives the attire the right look, fall and grace, and its comfort reflects on whoever wears it,” says the designer, whose ‘sasural’ is in Lucknow.“We admire as much the Indian saris, ‘ghararas’ and the hand embroidery, particularly ‘chikankaari’ and ‘patti’ or ‘dubka’, though, ‘zari’ work is better, more neat and intricate on our side,” says Yasmin, who showcased her range in Delhi at an exhibition organised by FICCI in 2015. She is a regular at exhibitions in Dubai, where she gets to meet counterparts from India and Lucknow too. “Appreciation for each other’s work is what keeps relations alive and if the exchange of products is not easy, at least designs and ideas keep reaching one another,” she says.The most popular in the men’s section is the ‘shalwar kameez’ ensemble, which is often complemented with a matching ‘dupatta’ or scarf.Pakistani waistcoats worn by actors Fawad Khan, Shaan Shahid and Imran Abbas add a layer of sophistication when worn over ‘kurtas’ for formal occasions.The ‘achkan’ and ‘sherwani’ are primarily being worn at weddings and ceremonial functions, featuring intricate embroidery and buttoned closures. These garments are typically crafted from rich fabrics like silk, brocade, and velvet. ‘Churidar’, known for its tight-fitting style around the calf area, is paired with both ‘kurtas’ and ‘sherwanis’.","Pakistani tv dramas have influenced fashion in lucknow, prompting local boutiques and tailors to replicate trending designs.

As dawn breaks over Jebel Ali Port , the synchronised movements of cranes and the steady flow of cargo vessels highlight Dubai 's emergence as a global logistics hub. Once a vital transit point between East and West, the city is now actively shaping the future of global supply chains with cutting-edge technology, infrastructure, and government-backed smart trade initiatives.At the heart of this transformation is a flourishing trade relationship with India—one that is not only rooted in history but is now accelerating into the future, powered by AI-driven logistics, automation, and free trade agreements.For centuries, India and Dubai have shared a strong economic relationship, and today, that connection is being redefined by innovation. The UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), signed in 2022, eliminated tariffs on over 10,000 products and set a goal to increase non-oil trade to $100 billion by 2030 But beyond trade figures, Dubai offers Indian logistics firms something even more valuable—a world-class supply chain ecosystem, a thriving free trade environment, and an AI-powered logistics infrastructure that makes global expansion seamless.""India holds great strategic importance for DP World,"" said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World. ""We have invested over $2.5 billion in the country’s logistics ecosystem to enhance domestic and global connectivity.”This commitment to enhancing India-UAE trade routes has positioned Dubai as a springboard for Indian logistics companies seeking global reach.Dubai’s logistics infrastructure is built for speed, scale, and efficiency. The Jebel Ali Port , one of the world's largest and busiest container ports, and Jebel Ali Free Zone ( Jafza ), which houses over 10,700 multinational companies, create a seamless supply chain network, reducing logistics costs and optimising operations.For Indian logistics startups, this presents a strategic advantage—access to a globally connected hub with state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions.“Many enterprises struggle with visibility into their logistics costs. They don’t always know how much they are spending or where inefficiencies lie,” says Deepesh Kuruppath, Founder & CEO of CargoFL, a supply chain AI platform. “In Dubai, we have found the perfect ecosystem to introduce AI-driven optimisations for large enterprises.”CargoFL’s platform identifies inefficiencies in a company’s supply chain and provides automation and digitisation solutions. With advanced AI-driven analytics, companies can save up to 10% on logistics costs, according to Kuruppath.Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub. The city’s leadership in AI, automation, and blockchain technology is creating one of the most sophisticated digital supply chain ecosystems in the world.Government initiatives like the Dubai Silk Road strategy and the Dubai AI Strategy have transformed the logistics sector, making it easier for businesses to automate supply chain processes, track shipments in real-time, and optimize freight movements using predictive analytics.""We recognise the critical role the logistics sector plays in enabling the growth of industries globally,"" said Abdulla Bin Damithan, CEO and Managing Director of DP World UAE & Jafza . ""As the UAE continues to grow into a global processing and re-distribution gateway, we have experienced a significant spike in demand for logistics and warehousing space.”For companies like Fero.AI, Dubai is the ideal testing ground for logistics automation. “We operate in one of the most advanced trade ecosystems in the world,” says Abhinav Chaudhary, CEO and Founder of Fero.AI. “Dubai’s logistics infrastructure, combined with government-backed smart trade initiatives, has allowed us to integrate AI-powered solutions efficiently.”Fero.AI specialises in automating freight and supply chain processes and collaborates with DP World to implement AI-driven logistics solutions. The company sees Dubai as a perfect platform to introduce cutting-edge logistics automation technologies.Dubai’s free zones have made the emirate one of the most attractive destinations for Indian logistics firms. Jafza, for instance, offers - 100% foreign ownership, zero import/export duties, unrestricted currency repatriation, and simplified business setup processes.” For an Indian company, setting up in Jafza is almost seamless,"" says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “You don’t face the tax burdens and operational complexities that exist elsewhere. Dubai’s free zones are designed for logistics companies to thrive.”Jafza is expanding its logistics capacity with the development of the Jafza Logistics Park, a multi-tenant warehousing facility in the Jebel Ali Free Zone. Phase 1 of the project, which was scheduled for completion in 2023, was successfully completed as of November 2024.""We are building the Jafza Logistics Park in response to increasing demand and to further boost the development of the UAE’s logistics sector,"" added Damithan of DP World UAE & Jafza.With fast-track business licensing, cutting-edge warehousing facilities, and streamlined customs processes, Jafza has become a magnet for Indian logistics and supply chain companies.As India’s economy expands and Dubai cements its status as a global logistics hub, the partnership between the two regions is set to grow exponentially.“We are at the beginning of a major shift,” says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “Dubai is no longer just a transit hub—it is a technology hub. AI, automation, and smart logistics are redefining how supply chains function, and Indian companies have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this transformation.”For Indian logistics firms looking to scale globally, optimize costs, and tap into AI-driven supply chain solutions, the message is clear:Dubai is not just a bridge between East and West—it is the future of global logistics.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.This article is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub.

Trump auto tariffs impact: Tata Motors shares declined 6.31% to Rs 663 during early trading hours on Thursday, following the announcement by US President Donald Trump regarding implementation of 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week.The United States of America is a significant market for Jaguar Land Rover , contributing 22% of total sales according to JLR's annual report for the 2024 financial year.At 10:54 AM, Tata Motors shares were trading at Rs 675.65, down Rs 32 or 4.56% on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Tata Motors' stock has experienced a decline of 28.18% and lagged behind its sector's performance by 33.35% during the previous year. However, investors who held the stock for three years benefited from a substantial return of 63.91%, according to an ET report.Also Read | India caught in crossfire as Trump's 25% auto tariffs roil global supply chains During a management conference, company executives provided assurance to investors regarding JLR's FY25 EBIT targets. The Chief Financial Officer validated the company's trajectory towards achieving the FY25 EBIT margin target of minimum 8.5%, whilst highlighting that JLR's volume performance in FY26 could be affected due to Jaguar models being discontinued.According to the ET report, the company indicated that potential U.S. tariffs on European imports might necessitate price adjustments and efficiency measures to offset the impact. While Trump plans to implement retaliatory tariffs on April 2, the U.S. administration has indicated selective enforcement. However, specific details about exempted countries or sectors remain unclear.This decision by Donald Trump intensifies international trade tensions following his return to the White House this year. Industry analysts suggest this development will lead to increased prices and supply chain disruptions in the automotive sector.“We're going to impose a 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States,” Trump stated during an event in the Oval Office.Trump considers tariffs as a revenue source to balance his promised tax reductions and strengthen the U.S. industrial sector.

India to expand solar PV module capacity to 125 GW by 2030: Pralhad Joshi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-expand-solar-pv-module-capacity-to-125-gw-by-2030-pralhad-joshi/articleshow/119712459.cms,"File photo- Pralhad Joshi

Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi, announced on Saturday that India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing capacity will grow from 80 gigawatts (GW) to 125 GW by 2030.The country’s solar cell manufacturing capacity is also expected to rise from 25 GW to 40 GW soon. The minister made these remarks during the inauguration of a state-of-the-art 5.4 GW solar cell manufacturing facility by Waaree Energies Limited in Gujarat’s Degam, according to news agency PTI.In 2014, India had little to no solar PV module manufacturing, but today, companies like Waaree are producing 80 GW of solar PV modules, Joshi said. He emphasized that India is advancing towards an integrated solar model, where all stages of production, from polysilicon to modules, will be manufactured domestically.India has become the world’s third-largest producer of renewable energy, and the minister expressed confidence that the country will achieve its target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, up from the current 220 GW. “If Prime Minister Narendra Modi is there, then it is possible,” Joshi remarked.India is also leading in the global green energy space, with the country issuing the world’s largest bid for green ammonia and securing 50% of export orders for electrolyser and green hydrogen manufacturing. The minister highlighted that, despite having 17% of the global population, India’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 4%, underlining the country’s commitment to sustainable energy.He noted that in the past, solar PV modules were imported, mostly from China and other countries. However, India has made significant strides in local manufacturing with the introduction of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) and government incentives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme.Joshi reaffirmed that the government’s commitment is to ensure the complete manufacturing of everything from polysilicon to modules, and from green ammonia to methanol, in India, positioning the country as a global leader in renewable energy. He also projected that by 2032, India’s energy demand will double, with electricity connectivity reaching 18,100 villages, solidifying the nation’s status as a global manufacturing hub.Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel, also present at the event, praised Prime Minister Modi for establishing Gujarat as a model of development and growth, citing the state’s business-friendly policies, including the Atmanirbhar Gujarat policy. The policy has already attracted Rs 43,000 crore in investments, with 183 units becoming operational.","India's solar photovoltaic (pv) module manufacturing capacity will grow from 80 gigawatts (gw) to 125 gw by 2030.

Goldman Sachs cuts target prices on IT stocks amid US macroeconomic uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/goldman-sachs-cuts-target-prices-on-it-stocks-amid-us-macroeconomic-uncertainty/articleshow/119704822.cms,"Representative image

Global brokerage firm Goldman Sachs has reduced its price targets on Indian IT stocks by 3% to 32%, citing lower revenue growth forecasts driven by macroeconomic uncertainty in the US.According to an ET report, the brokerage noted that the US accounts for around 60% of India’s IT revenues, and the downgrade in GDP forecasts for the world’s largest economy, along with the increased possibility of a recession caused by tariffs and Accenture’s indication of heightened uncertainty, led to the cut in target prices.Goldman downgraded LTIMindtree to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy,’ stating that “we downgrade LTIMindtree given reduced near-term growth and margin visibility due to the company’s higher discretionary exposure vs peers, premium valuations vs sector and a more balanced risk-reward.” The company’s elevated exposure to discretionary spending and premium valuations were key factors in the downgrade, according to the brokerage.On Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Goldman Sachs pointed out that the company is “poised better than its peers” due to its diversified revenue base, potential benefits from vendor consolidation, and “reasonably high margin visibility.” TCS is seen as better positioned compared to peers such as Wipro and Tech Mahindra, which are likely to face a more significant negative impact from growth challenges and vendor consolidation.Goldman analysts also highlighted the challenges ahead: “The recovery in discretionary spending, which has remained muted for the last two years, could be delayed further on account of slower decision-making potentially translating into pauses/deferral of IT spending by enterprises.” Additionally, they warned that a prolonged macroeconomic downturn could lead to “project re-scoping or cancellations,” which would further put pressure on India’s IT sector multiples.",Goldman sachs has reduced its price targets on indian it stocks by 3% to 32%.

"FIIs offload Rs 1.27 lakh crore in FY2025, DIIs remain bullish",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fiis-offload-rs-1-27-lakh-crore-in-fy2025-diis-remain-bullish/articleshow/119719807.cms,"Disclaimer: The opinions, analyses and recommendations expressed herein are those of brokerage and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.

Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in FY2025, offloading domestic equities worth Rs 1,27,401 crore. However, the intensity of selling eased considerably in March, with FIIs selling shares worth Rs 3,972.61 crore.Meanwhile, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) remained consistent buyers throughout the year, purchasing stocks worth Rs 6,06,368 crore, with March seeing buying activity of Rs 37,079.08 crore, according to an ET report quoting data from Ritesh Presswala.On Friday, FIIs sold shares worth Rs 4,352.82 crore, while DIIs were net buyers, purchasing Rs 7,646.49 crore. Throughout the financial year, FIIs were net sellers on seven occasions, with the highest sell-offs occurring in October and January, when FIIs sold Rs 94,017 crore and Rs 78,027 crore, respectively.FIIs were net buyers in June, July, August, September, and December, with the highest buying observed in September, amounting to Rs 57,724 crore.DIIs were bullish on Indian equities throughout the year, with no month showing net selling activity. October and January saw the highest DII buying at Rs 1,07,255 crore and Rs 86,592 crore, respectively.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, observed that the shift in FII strategy—from sustained selling to modest buying—was visible in the week ending March 21, and it gained momentum the following week. This reversal in FII flows contributed to Nifty’s nearly 6% gains in March, ending a five-month decline, the longest streak since the index's inception in 1996.Vijayakumar attributed the change to three key factors: first, attractive valuations after a 16% decline in Nifty from the September peak to February; second, the appreciation of the rupee, which reversed the momentum trade towards US investments; and third, improvements in India’s macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, IIP, and CPI inflation, which paved the way for the market rally.Going forward, the trend in FII flows will depend largely on the reciprocal tariffs the US is expected to impose on April 2. If the tariffs are not severe, the rally may continue.Manoj Purohit, Partner & Leader at BDO India, pointed out another significant development. Sebi's recent announcement regarding the FPI community could act as a sentiment booster. Based on the reactions from large banks regarding the restriction on P-Notes trading volume, the threshold for granular beneficial ownership disclosures has been increased from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 50,000 crore.FPIs with more than 50% of their portfolio in a single corporate group will continue to follow the earlier limit. This change is expected to bring back much-needed volume in trades and liquidity in the market.Also, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to double the cap on investment by individual foreign investors in listed companies to 10%. This move aims to attract more capital inflows into the Indian market, according to senior government officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.","Foreign institutional investors (fiis) were net sellers in fy2025, offloading domestic equities worth rs 1,27,401 crore.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal announced on Saturday that a German chemical company will invest USD 1.5 billion in India, with a state already having identified land for the project.While the minister did not disclose the name of the company or the state involved, he mentioned that the company's head is expected to meet with the state's chief minister on Sunday, according to news agency PTI.The company will be granted land allocation, and over the next 12 months, the country will see a significant inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), Goyal stated during a session at the Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA). The company is seeking around 250 acres of land near a port.Germany ranks as the ninth-largest investor in India, with the country receiving around USD 15 billion in FDI between April 2000 and December 2024. Goyal emphasized that more and more international companies are looking to invest in India, attracted by the growing business opportunities.The government has undertaken several measures to improve the country's business environment, including reducing compliance burdens and decriminalizing minor offences. These steps, according to Goyal, are fostering greater investor confidence, and the government is committed to supporting businesses facing challenges such as outdated laws or unfair competition from predatory pricing.On the subject of arbitration, Goyal highlighted its potential to reduce judicial delays if both parties respect the arbitration results. However, he acknowledged concerns about the quality of arbitration, including whether the government effectively presents its case and whether arbitration is genuinely fair or influenced by powerful corporations.He stressed the importance of strengthening arbitration mechanisms to inspire confidence among all stakeholders. Goyal also called for making arbitration and mediation more widespread in India’s legal system, noting that as the country’s manufacturing sector grows, disputes and disagreements will inevitably arise. He believes that streamlining these processes will support India’s ambitions to become a global manufacturing hub.","A german chemical company will invest usd 1.5 billion in india,commerce and industry minister piyush goyal announced.
