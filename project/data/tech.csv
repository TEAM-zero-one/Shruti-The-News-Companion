BENGALURU: Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd has become the first Indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle. HAL secured the transfer of technology (ToT) for Isro 's Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) at a cost of Rs 511 crore.Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced Friday that this first-of-its-kind complete ToT marked a significant milestone. Unlike the manufacturing contract of PSLV - shared between HAL and L&T - the SSLV has been fully offered to HAL. The company will own the rocket, build it, market it, and launch it independently.The selection process involved two stages. Out of nine applicants, six were shortlisted in the first round. A committee led by former principal scientific adviser to govt of India, Prof Vijaya Raghavan, and co-headed by former Isro director Suresh, then evaluated the techno-commercial bids of three firms. All were technically qualified but HAL emerged as the highest bidder at Rs 511 crore, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka said.While HAL submitted an independent bid, the other two finalists were consortia - one led by Bengaluru-based Alpha Design and the other by Bharat Dynamics Ltd from Hyderabad.""Payment will be done in phases. ToT will take two years. HAL will make at least two SSLV prototypes with complete help and hand-holding by Isro and after two years, they will be on their own. The initial ToT agreement will be for the first two years and then another contract will be signed between HAL and Isro,"" Goenka said.After the initial two years, HAL will function independently and can even modify the rocket design or choose new partners. A formal contract involving NewSpace India Ltd (Nsil), HAL, Isro and IN-SPACe will be signed soon. Nsil will manage the commercial aspects while IN-SPACe, in collaboration with Isro centres, will oversee the technology transfer.Barenya Senapati, HAL's director of finance, said the win aligned with HAL's broader goal of significantly expanding its space portfolio. He assured the new programme would not affect HAL's other operations.Regarding liability for rocket launches, Goenka noted that, under international norms, the state bore primary responsibility. ""It is up to govt to decide how much of the liability will remain with the state and how much will be transferred to HAL. The company will comply with applicable laws once the contract is finalised,"" he said.","Hindustan aeronautics ltd has become the first indian firm to fully acquire technology of a launch vehicle.

It’s important to note that these

warning notices and an investigation report are not related to the Air India AI 171 Boeing 787 crash that happened on June 12.

What DGCA warned Air India about

The aviation regulator's report quoted in the Reuters report revealed that during May inspections, three Air India Airbus aircraft were found operating with overdue mandatory checks on escape slides, which are vital emergency equipment.

An Airbus A320 aircraft's inspection was conducted on May 15, more than a month behind schedule. During this period, AirNav Radar tracking showed the aircraft served international routes including Dubai, Riyadh and Jeddah.

The findings also highlighted that an Airbus A319, used for domestic flights, had checks delayed by over three months, whilst another aircraft's inspection was conducted two days late.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had issued a warning to Air India regarding safety protocol violations, as three of the airline’s Airbus aircraft continued operations despite pending inspections of emergency systems. The regulatory body also criticised the airline's delayed response in addressing these concerns, according to a Reuters report.These communications and warnings by DGCA were given to Air India days before the crash of the Dreamliner.The DGCA report said: ""The above cases indicate that aircraft were operated with expired or unverified emergency equipment, which is a violation of standard airworthiness and safety requirements.""Also Read | Air India crash: N Chandrasekaran makes important statement; says AI 171 Boeing 787 Dreamliner had ‘new engine’, ‘clean history’ & ‘no red flags’ The regulator noted that Air India ""failed to submit timely compliance responses"" to identified deficiencies, ""further evidencing weak procedural control and oversight.""The airline, acquired by the Tata Group in 2022 from the government, responded that it was ""accelerating"" the verification of all maintenance records, including escape slide dates, with completion expected within days.The carrier clarified that in one instance, the issue was discovered when an AI Engineering Services engineer accidentally deployed an escape slide during maintenance work.Safety checks on emergency escape slides are crucial, as their malfunction during accidents could result in grave consequences, according to Vibhuti Singh, who previously served as a legal expert at the government's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.The aviation regulator DGCA said that aircraft failing to undergo mandatory inspections would have their airworthiness certificates considered suspended.Documentation reveals that Animesh Garg, who holds the position of deputy director of airworthiness in the Indian government, dispatched the warning notices and reports to Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson and other senior officials, including the continuing airworthiness manager, quality manager and head of planning.Also Read | Air India plane crash: After 12/6, demand for Air India's 787s crashes A legal specialist in aviation matters indicated that such violations typically result in financial and civil penalties for both the company and individual executives.In a previous statement to Reuters, Wilson acknowledged that whilst global parts shortages affected the industry broadly, Air India faced greater challenges due to its older fleet, with numerous aircraft remaining unmodernised since their delivery in 2010-2011.Aviation authorities across the globe, including India's regulatory body, impose penalties on airlines for breaching compliance requirements. In February, the government informed parliament about 23 instances where airlines faced warnings or penalties for safety violations in the previous year.Air India and Air India Express accounted for twelve of these violations, with one case involving ""unauthorised entry into the cockpit"".

Boston Bruins open to trading seventh overall pick for roster-ready player



Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov floated as trade options



Trade talks expected to intensify as draft nears



The New York Islanders appear to be going all in ahead of the NHL Draft. According to multiple reports, they are aggressively pursuing a second top-10 pick to go alongside the one they already hold. The rumored goal is to select both star defenseman Matthew Schaefer and local standout forward James Hagens.The Boston Bruins, owners of the 7th overall pick, are reportedly willing to part with the selection if it lands them a player who can help immediately. Their front office has made it clear they are more focused on improving the current roster rather than adding another developmental prospect.According to reports from RG Media’s James Murphy and Stefan Rosney, talks between the Bruins and Islanders have become increasingly serious. Sources close to the situation suggest that Boston’s priority is to add a top-six forward or a top-four defenseman if they are to surrender such a valuable draft position.In order for the trade to materialize, the Islanders would have to offer more than draft capital. Reports indicate that defensemen Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov, along with forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau, have come up in trade discussions.Among the trio, Dobson would be the most impactful piece.The 24-year-old logged a career-best season and has grown into one of the Islanders’ most dependable blue liners.With less than a week to go before the NHL Draft on June 27, time is ticking.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Poll Do you think having a star wide receiver is crucial for a team’s success? Yes, it can change the game No, overall teamwork matters more

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver













The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next. Rumors are swirling across social media platforms and major sports networks, generating intense excitement among Kansas City supporters eager to see a fresh offensive spark take the field this fall.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town.If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers. That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.If the Chiefs land Brandon Aiyuk, it could redefine their offensive identity, give Mahomes a true top target, and position Kansas City as overwhelming favorites heading into the 2025 NFL season.If the Chiefs successfully sign Brandon Aiyuk, it could mark a turning point for the franchise’s offense, providing Mahomes with the elite receiver he’s been missing.

Iran Stuns Israel, Fires Hypersonic Missile Fattah-1 At Tel Aviv | Trump Demands Tehran's Surrender

Iran has reportedly went for a near-total Internet Blackout Tuesday (June 17) as conflict with Israel deepened. According to a report by NBC News, the drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran’s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. The report quotes Kentinc and Netblocks, the two companies that track global internet connectivity. According to NBC News, quoting these companies, Iran’s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians’ ability to access and share information with the outside world.The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks (VPNs) used to access foreign sites. Data published by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, reportedly said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.Iran’s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. In 2019, the country implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, reportedly said that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says Anthropic CEO is very wrong

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%. The stark prediction comes as AI technology rapidly advances, with sectors including technology, finance, law, and consulting facing the greatest disruption.""We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,"" Amodei told Axios in an interview published Wednesday. The 42-year-old CEO emphasized that most people remain unaware of the impending transformation, calling it a reality that ""sounds crazy, and people just don't believe it.""Nvidia CEO expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI. While acknowledging that AI will inevitably transform roles and that humanity is undergoing a shift even greater than the Industrial Revolution, Demis Hassabis remains optimistic about human adaptability. He believes AI will lead to the emergence of ""new very valuable jobs,"" particularly benefiting ""technically savvy people who are at the forefront of using these technologies.""Demis Hassabis's primary concern regarding AI lies not in job loss, but in its potential misuse by malicious actors. He stresses the urgent need for global regulation and an international framework to govern AI, likening it to a ""digital Geneva Convention,"" to prevent powerful AI systems from falling into the wrong hands.",Anthropic ceo dario amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasize this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organizations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.","Facebook, instagram, gmail and other account login details compromised in this massive data breach.

Google’s Veo 3 to enhance Shorts content creation

YouTube will integrate Google’s latest AI video generation model, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this year, CEO Neal Mohan announced. Speaking at a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival, Mohan said “The possibilities with AI are limitless”. He was joined by creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution,” Mohan added.YouTube currently uses an earlier version of Veo in its Dream Screen feature, which creates AI-generated backgrounds. Veo 3 marks a major upgrade, offering more advanced video creation tools. Google released the Veo 3 tool last month at I/O 2025. The AI-powered video generation tool allows users to generate videos from text and image prompts.Mohan said the new tool will “open new creative lanes” for Shorts creators, helping them experiment with content formats. YouTube Shorts, launched in 2021, now sees over 200 billion views per day, according to Mohan. Its growing popularity puts it in direct competition with TikTok and Instagram Reels.Mohan emphasized the role of creators in shaping modern entertainment. “My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he said.“Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”","Google’s veo 3 to enhance shorts content creation tool.

As reported by Reuters, the comprehensive trial, which involved over 1,000 Australian school students and hundreds of adults, concluded earlier this month.The Australian government is pushing ahead with a law, set to come into effect in December, that will require social media giants like Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Snapchat, and TikTok to implement ""reasonable steps"" to block under-16s from their platforms. Companies failing to comply could face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).Tony Allen, CEO of the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme , the organization overseeing the Australian trial, stated on Friday that ""Age assurance can be done in Australia privately, efficiently and effectively."" He further noted that the trial found ""no significant tech barriers"" to rolling out a software-based scheme.However, Allen also cautioned that ""no one-size-fits-all solution, and no solution that worked perfectly in all deployments"" was identified. Concerns were also raised about some age-assurance software firms potentially ""over-collecting"" data in anticipation of future law enforcement or regulatory needs.As per the report, the initial findings reveal a positive outlook for the government announced ban. This comes despite ongoing skepticism from child protection advocates, tech industry groups, and even teenagers themselves, who have questioned the ban's enforceability due to potential workarounds like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).The trial conducted explored various age verification methods using facial recognition, inferring age based on behaviour and parental controls. During the test some of the facial recognition tools were reported to be almost accurate. However, other reports from the trial highlighted issues with accuracy, such as misidentifying children as older or having higher error rates for certain demographics.The complete report from the Age Assurance Technology Trial is said to be delivered to the Australian government next month. These findings will then inform an industry consultation ahead of the December deadline for the ban's implementation.","Australia's plan to ban under-16s from social media platforms like tiktok, instagram and snapchat is gaining traction.

Apple foldable iPhone: Likely specs and design



Apple foldable iPhone initial shipments



Apple foldable iPhone: Likely price



Apple is expected to enter the foldable smartphone market next year. As per the popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , the iPhone maker may launch its first foldable iPhone in 2026. Kuo has revealed that Apple may start manufacturing the much-awaited foldable iPhone in late Q3 or Q4 of 2025. “Assembly supplier Foxconn is expected to officially kick off the project in late 3Q25 or early 4Q25. As of now, many component specifications (including the hinge, which has drawn considerable market attention) have yet to be finalized,” wrote Kuo in a post on X.As per Kuo, the first foldable iPhone is said to feature a ""book-style"" design, akin to Samsung's Galaxy Fold series, rather than a clamshell form factor. The yet to launch foldable iPhone is tipped to feature a 7.8-inch internal display designed to be ""crease-free,"" a significant engineering feat that would differentiate it from many current foldable offerings. The external display is said to measure 5.5-inches.“The foldable display is one of the few components with finalized specifications and serves as a good reference for estimating potential shipments. Samsung Display (SDC) plans to build annual production capacity for 7-8 million foldable panels to supply the 2026 foldable iPhone. Given that actual production in 2026 may span only a few months, panel shipments that year are likely to fall short of full capacity.” Added Kuo.Further details emerging from Kuo's analysis suggest the device will boast a titanium alloy chassis, a dual-camera system, and an impressively thin profile, measuring under 5mm when unfolded and between 9-9.5mm when folded. Due to internal space considerations, the foldable iPhone may incorporate Touch ID as a side-mounted sensor instead of Face ID.Initial shipments for the foldable iPhone are projected to be between 3 to 5 million units in 2026. Apple has reportedly placed a total order for 15 to 20 million foldable iPhones, but this volume is expected to be spread across a two to three-year product lifecycle, suggesting a more gradual market adoption for what is expected to be a premium-priced device.“Recent market rumors suggest Apple has placed an order for 15–20 million foldable iPhones. Based on checks across multiple components, this volume likely reflects cumulative demand over the product’s 2–3 year lifecycle, rather than 2026 alone. This indicates that Apple’s foldable iPhone, expected to enter mass production in 2H26, may ship several million units annually in both 2027 and 2028, possibly due to its premium pricing,” said Kuo.Rumors indicate the foldable iPhone could carry a price tag upwards of $2,000 to $2,500 (approximately Rs 1.73 lakh to Rs 2.16 lakh).","Apple is expected to enter the foldable smartphone market next year.

As the UAE accelerates its pivot from a resource-driven economy to a knowledge-based one, a quiet revolution is taking place in its classrooms. The country’s long-term ambitions, from artificial intelligence to clean energy, space exploration to smart cities, depend not on oil, but on minds. Bright, agile, and future-ready minds.Recognizing this, the UAE has placed exceptional focus on finding and nurturing its most gifted youth, early, accurately, and inclusively. At the center of this national strategy is the Hamdan Talent Scale: a groundbreaking scientific tool that’s reshaping how the country identifies and develops its next generation of innovators, scientists, and leaders.Since early 2025, nearly 9,000 students have undergone evaluations through the national Talent Identification Program. The result: over 400 gifted students have been identified in just a few months.Dr. Mariam Al Ghawi, Director of the Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Centre for Giftedness and Innovation, said:“Since the beginning of 2025, nearly 9,000 students have been evaluated through the national Talent Identification Program, resulting in the discovery of more than 400 gifted students. This outcome underscores the accuracy and efficiency of the scale.It reinforces the development of tailored programs to support this exceptional group of learners.”To date, more than 2,000 gifted students have already been identified through the program. Many of them are currently enrolled in specialized academic tracks that emphasize STEM education, innovation labs, and expert mentorship, a system closely aligned with the UAE's long-term vision for national innovation and human capital development.Dr. Al Ghawi emphasized:“It is considered one of the most advanced systems for identifying gifted and talented individuals in the Arab world.”Designed for students in Grades 4 through 12, the Hamdan Talent Scale is part of a national effort to identify and support gifted learners using a culturally relevant, research-based approach. Dr. Mariam Al Ghawi explained how the tool works and why it stands out:“The test is a scientifically developed tool designed to identify gifted students in grades 4 through 12. Initiated by the Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, this test combines international research with local cultural and educational values, offering a comprehensive assessment of students' intellectual, academic, and creative abilities.”The program uses a three-stage process to ensure accurate and fair identification of talent:“This process ensures fairness and accessibility, covering public and private schools across the seven emirates,” Dr. Al Ghawi added.Students selected through the Hamdan Talent Scale gain access to a world of opportunity. The program is built around STEM and arts enrichment, including:These experiences are designed to cultivate critical thinking, leadership, and creativity, key attributes for the UAE's future innovators and leaders.Notably, participation is entirely free of charge. Activities are conducted on weekends, school holidays, or through school visits. Development programs are structured to evolve gradually over eight years, ensuring long-term impact and sustainability.One of the hallmark features of the initiative is its inclusivity. Open to students of all nationalities, the program reflects the UAE's broader vision for a future-ready education system. Since launch, more than 2,200 talented students have been identified, with a target of 5,000 students by 2030.Beyond student support, the program also invests in:These initiatives aim to create a national culture that celebrates and nurtures talent, aligning with the goals of the UAE Centennial Vision 2071.","In 2025, the hamdan talent scale assessed 39,000+ uae students, discovering over 400 gifted talents.

LONDON: A gay British couple working as spiritual healers who uploaded an Instagram video from Ahmedabad airport saying how happy and calm India had left them just before boarding the doomed Air India flight AI171 are among the victims of the tragedy.Fiongal Greenlaw-Meek (39) a tarot reader, psychic artiste and spiritual adviser and founder of Wellness Foundry, and his husband Jamie Meek (45), a spiritual practitioner and yoga teacher, director of events at the foundry, based in Vauxhall, London, had been travelling in India before the crash and posted videos of their holiday on social media.The passenger list shows that both boarded the plane.They put a jovial video up on Instagram shortly before boarding from the gate at Ahmedabad airport. In it Fiongal said, “We are going back happily, happily, happily calm” and that his biggest takeaway was “Don’t lose patience with your partner” after Jamie joked Fiongal had “already snapped at him” having chai at the airport.In another Instagram video post they had posted from their boutique hotel, the House of MG, in Ahmedabad, Fiongal said: “It’s our last night in India and we’ve had a magical experience really and some mind-blowing things have happened.”“We really have been on quite a journey, and then just spending the last night here in this amazing hotel, and we have just had the most delicious Thali food. It was a perfect way to round up the trip. Excited to share it all with you,” Jamie said.The Wellness Foundry was founded by Fiongal in late 2018, born out of a spiritual awakening that was sparked by a mysterious illness he had. On its website, Fiongal said that seeking healing beyond conventional methods, he had delved into alternative practices that resonated with his soul.It began as a one-man endeavour and until now has 12 expert practitioners, offering tarot and psychic readings, past life regression and reiki healings, as well as psychic retreats.","Fiongal greenlaw-meek (39) a tarot reader, psychic artiste and spiritual adviser and founder of wellness foundry.
