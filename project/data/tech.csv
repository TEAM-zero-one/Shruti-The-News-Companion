Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple in discussions with openai, perplexity and others to add their ai tools as an option to safari.

Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders: ‘Get American AI out in front’ or risk losing China AI market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jensen-huangs-warning-to-us-leaders-get-american-ai-out-in-front-or-risk-losing-china-ai-market/articleshow/120992439.cms,"Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","Jensen huang recently emphasized the significance of the chinese ai market, which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.

Nintendo began distributing pre-order invitations today for its highly anticipated Switch 2 console, offering select customers a chance to secure the device ahead of its June 5 launch. The My Nintendo Store is prioritizing invites to accounts with 12-month Nintendo Online subscriptions and at least 50 hours of playtime on the original Switch.

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","Openai's sam altman launched the world project in the us on may 1, 2025.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

NEW YORK : President Donald Trump 's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls - perhaps three or five - instead of 30 if US import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump's child-sized Mercedes convertible.""COMPLETELY out of touch,"" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin.""If that ain't a 'Let them eat cake' moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.""The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps ""two dolls will cost a couple bucks more"" and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.Either way, the US toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the US come from China.The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:How much is the US doll market worth? From Barbie , Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the US as well as beloved playthings.The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated US sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.What are toy companies doing to navigate tariffs? The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the US to offset higher costs related to tariffs.The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it's speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.""Nobody insulates themselves with that much cash,"" he said.With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the US-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.""Let's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,"" he said.What goes into making a doll? Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.""We don't have any capacity in the US to make rooted doll hair. And then you've got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,"" James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.""It's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,"" he said. ""You have to know what you're doing in order to make that doll look like it's got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.""Are toys from China safe? White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the US Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.The rules apply to all products sold in the US Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to US consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the US duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.Can children have too many dolls? Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the USKatie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees there's too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trump's comments off-putting.""I think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,"" Walley-Wiegert said.San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.The trade war with China ""just makes it even more impossible for those families,"" Mak said.",The us toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the us come from china. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121037691,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Satellite communication companies need to pay 4% fee on revenue: Trai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/satcom-companies-need-to-pay-4-fee-on-revenue-trai/articleshow/121046567.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Telecom regulator Trai on Friday recommended a charge of 4% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for satellite communications operators, such as Elon Musk's Starlink, Bharti Enterprises-backed OneWeb and Jio-SES, and said the companies should be assigned spectrum for a period of five years, that can be extended by another two years.The regulator also proposed charges on satcom companies when acquiring customers in urban areas, while recommending subsidy for installation in dark zones, within rural and remote areas to encourage faster network enhancement.The long-awaited recommendations clear one more hurdle for Starlink and other satcom providers after revised guidelines issued by the department of telecom (DoT) recently, and issuance of Letter of Intent to Musk's company earlier this week.The AGR comes after govt decided to provide spectrum for satcom providers on an administrative basis, against auctions that are mandated for terrestrial service providers, such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel & Vodafone Idea.Trai did not fix any specific price for the airwaves as was being demanded by Jio and Airtel. The domestic terrestrial providers were pushing the govt for ""comparable"" spectrum pricing for satcom providers to ensure ""fair competition"" in the telecom sector and to drive in a ""level-playing field"".Trai chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti said the regulator did not find any case of satellite services eating into the broader business model of the terrestrial providers. ""After detailed examination, we have found that satellite services will be complementary and not competing,"" Lahoti said on the recommendations, which will now be examined by DoT. If found satisfactory, they will be taken to the cabinet and when approved, allow companies to get satcom licenses to start services.To ensure that companies don't squat on the spectrum and delay launch, Trai also fixed a 'minimum charge' of Rs 3,500 per MHz for the companies.Lahoti said an additional annual charge of Rs 500 per subscriber has been fixed if satcom companies acquire customers in urban areas, where network coverage is already robust. This is to ensure that they concentrate more on providing rural connectivity.",Trai recommended a charge of 4% of adjusted gross revenue (agr) for satellite communications operators.

Japan's SMBC to buy 20% in Yes Bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/japans-smbc-to-buy-20-in-yes-bank/articleshow/121041472.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

MUMBAI: Five years after a group of Indian lenders led by SBI stepped in to rescue Yes Bank, Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) will acquire a 20% stake in the private lender for Rs 13,483 crore, making it the largest shareholder. The deal, India's biggest cross-border banking investment, marks a shift in ownership of the bank once run by veteran banker Rana Kapoor.Kapoor lost control in 2020 after the bank nearly collapsed due to bad loans, which wiped out its net worth. RBI then mandated a reconstruction scheme under which eight Indian banks took equity stakes.SBI will now sell a 13.2% stake, cutting its holding to just over 10%. ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, Federal Bank, and Bandhan Bank will offload a combined 6.8%.The deal is priced at Rs 21.5 per share, above the recent market price and more than double what the rescuing banks invested.SMBC, a unit of Japan's second-largest bank by assets, will become Yes Bank's anchor investor after securing regulatory and shareholder approvals. The deal may reshape the bank's strategy and comes amid SMBC's broader push into Asia. Its parent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, has $2 trillion in assets and recently took full ownership of its Indian NBFC arm, SMFG India Credit (formerly Fullerton).SMFG sees India as a counterweight to Japan's ageing population and low growth. The firm is betting on India's demographics and macroeconomic momentum.On May 6, after reports of SMBC's interest, Yes Bank denied knowledge of any unannounced developments, causing shares to erase a 10% gain. The stock again surged 10% on Friday ahead of the announcement.Banking industry observers are waiting to see if SMBC takes the wholly-owned subsidiary (WoS) route in Yes Bank. In the past, both DBS and State Bank of Mauritius used the WoS route to acquire a local banking licence. Most large foreign banks operate as branches and need permission to open new ones. SMBC will also have to deal with a bank that has a bloated equity base, following massive capital infusions.","Japan's sumitomo mitsui banking corporation (smbc) will acquire a 20% stake in the private lender.
