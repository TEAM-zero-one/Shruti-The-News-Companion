Rs 355 crore sale marks new high for Indian art market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-355-crore-sale-marks-new-high-for-indian-art-market/articleshow/124200368.cms,"Vasudeo Gaitonde was a man who pursued perfection. He could spend months on a single canvas, only to destroy it if it failed his exacting standards. In his lifetime, his sublime abstractions-with their play of light and colour -were often overshadowed in a market enamoured of the decorative aesthetic of figurative art. Little could he have imagined that decades later, these same works would command millions in the auction room.On Saturday, a luminous yellow ochre canvas by the reclusive painter, who died in 2001, set a new world record for the artist at Saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in Delhi. The work sold for Rs 67.08 crore ($7.6 million), not only eclipsing his previous benchmark of Rs 42 crore but also making him the second priciest artist in India.The top slot still belongs to his fellow modernist M F Husain whose Gram Yatra sold for over Rs 100 crore earlier this year.The sale itself set a new benchmark. With total proceeds of Rs 355.8 crore ($40.2 million), it became the highest-value auction of South Asian art worldwide-a resounding signal of the Indian market's resilience even as global art sales waver. ""Indians are now seeing generational value in Indian art,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart's CEO.""For the wealthy, it's not just about diversification alongside real estate, equity, and gold. There's also social pressure-you can't have a big home and bad art.""Several other artists set new records that night. Tyeb Mehta's Trussed Bull (1956) fetched Rs 56 crore, eight times its upper estimate. Jehangir Sabavala's The Anchorite (1983) sold for Rs 16.8 crore while F N Souza's Six Gentlemen of Our Times (1955) brought in Rs 20 crore, a global auction record for a South Asian work on paper.The evening also saw a breakthrough for contemporary art. Nalini Malani's Nursery Tales sold for Rs 3.6 crore, underscoring how young collectors are increasingly drawn to politically and socially charged work. Malani, whose practice has long been unapologetically feminist and political, transforms the whimsy of nursery rhymes into allegories of violence and resistance.Her presence in international museums is well established; now the auction house too is a stage where her narratives command attention. Her success at Saffronart signals that as prices for the modernists soar, buyers are turning to contemporary voices that better match both their pockets and their sensibilities.","Vasudeo gaitonde set a new world record for the artist at saffronart's 25th anniversary sale in delhi.

"Govt proposes acoustic alert system for EVs, excluding 2- & 3-wheelers, from 2027",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-proposes-acoustic-alert-system-for-evs-excluding-2-3-wheelers-from-2027/articleshow/124200222.cms,"NEW DELHI: From Oct 2027 all electric cars, buses, and trucks will be required to have an Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS), which will automatically generate a sound alert, according to a draft notification issued by the road transport ministry. However, this requirement has not been proposed for electric two- and three-wheelers, as well as e-rickshaws, which too produce no noise.The draft notification states that all new models of electric passenger and goods vehicles manufactured after Oct 2026 must be equipped with AVAS, and all existing models produced from Oct 2027 onward must have the feature.TOI had reported on July 5 the govt’s move to introduce this regulation requiring vehicle manufacturers to install an electronic system that automatically produces sound when these electric vehicles are moving at speeds of up to 20 kmph. Since such vehicles produce almost no noise, they are categorised as Quiet Road Transport Vehicles (QRTVs).The AVAS is primarily designed for electric and hybrid vehicles to emit artificial sounds to alert pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users to their presence, especially at low speeds when these vehicles are very quiet.“There is a dire need to mandate this feature in electric two- and three-wheelers too.We see more instances of pedestrians being hit by two-wheelers, and since these make no noise, the risk of accidents is greater,” said Anil Chhikara, a former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.The AVAS will not be required for higher speeds when tyres of EVs generate sufficient noise.Sources said the ministry’s notification also proposes to do away with the requirement to carry a spare tyre for cars, three-wheelers, and quadricycles that have tubeless tyres.","From oct 2027 all electric cars, buses, and trucks will be required to have an acoustic vehicle alerting system.

Donald Trump's new Gold Card programme, offering a fast-track route to US residency, has sparked growing interest among Indians chasing the American dream, particularly after his administration hiked H-1B visa fees to $100,000.The Gold Card, signed into effect through an executive order on September 19, requires a non-refundable $1 million ""gift"" to the US Treasury, or $2 million through corporate sponsorship.Unlike the EB-5 investor visa, the scheme is positioned as a contribution to ""American industry and commerce.""Immigration firms say the demand has risen significantly since the H-1B overhaul.

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Garman also stressed the importance of customer attendance at Reinvent, targeting over 60,000 attendees to match last year's conference turnout.However, an Amazon spokesperson disputed the Reuters report, calling it a ""gross misinterpretation"" of what was described as an ""inspiring internal conversation.""","Amazon web services ceo matt garman has urged his staff to expedite product rollouts, particularly in ai.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

Economist Peter Schiff stoked a controversy on H-1B as he expressed his opinion that the hike in the visa fee would not stop tech companies from hiring foreigners.

California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has appointed Prof Mansi Manoj Kasliwal as director of Palomar Observatory, making her the first woman and the second PIO to lead the facility. Shrinivas Kulkarni (2006-18) was the first PIO to head the observatory, located atop Palomar Mountain in north San Diego, California.Palomar Observatory is home to three active research telescopes: the 5.1m Hale Telescope, the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Telescope, and the 1.5m telescope. Research there is conducted by a wide community of astronomers from Caltech and other domestic and international partner institutions.Kasliwal, a professor of astronomy at Caltech, is internationally recognised for her pioneering work on explosive cosmic events such as supernovae and colliding neutron stars. In 2022, she received New Horizons in Physics Prize for her leadership in electromagnetic follow-ups of cosmic phenomena.Born in Indore, Kasliwal moved to the US at 15. She earned her bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 2005 and completed her PhD in astronomy at Caltech in 2011.After postdoctoral research at Carnegie Observatories, she returned to Caltech, where she is now a tenured professor.The Kasliwal research group at Palomar Observatory focuses on discovering and characterising ""cosmic fireworks"" - brilliant flashes of light that reveal the lifecycle of stars and the synthesis of elements. ""Our primary discovery engines are two robotic, wide-field infrared and optical cameras at Palomar Observatory. We collaborate with astronomers worldwide to panchromatically characterise the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum. We pursue a multi-messenger quest to identify electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events,"" Kasliwal's description on the Palomar Observatory website reads.Her research centres on transient astronomy, the study of rapidly changing cosmic phenomena. She leads Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) project, which coordinates a worldwide network of telescopes to capture fleeting cosmic events.Kasliwal also played a key role in designing Palomar Transient Factory and Zwicky Transient Facility, both of which have uncovered thousands of supernovae and other astronomical phenomena.Her contributions extend to multi-messenger astronomy, including crucial follow-up observations of gravitational waves detected by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. She has also developed infrared-sensitive telescopes that reveal the chemistry and evolution of cosmic explosions.

'I Don't Agree With Him': Trump Opposes Starmer's Push For Palestinian Statehood

What is the digital ID plan?



Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","Uk prime minister keir starmer on friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital id system for all nationals and residents.

What experts say





China on Monday said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the Communist Party.Cyberspace administration of China announced a two-month campaign targeting content on social media, short-video apps, and live-streaming platforms, which are “maliciously misinterpret social phenomena, selectively exaggerates negative cases, and use them as an opportunity to promote nihilistic or otherwise negative worldviews. ”State-run media praised the campaign as a necessary step to restore order online, warning that negative content can cause panic and damage public trust.“The harm of such maliciously divisive content is significant. It can trigger collective misunderstandings and social panic, marginalise reason and facts, and even spark offline conflicts causing long-term damage to public order and social trust,” it wrote.The campaign comes at a time when China’s economic slowdown has hit young people the hardest. Growth in factory output and retail sales recently dropped to their lowest in months. Youth unemployment, excluding students, climbed to 18.9% in August, a two-year high.A long-running property crisis has weakened consumer confidence, reduced spending, and pushed youth unemployment higher.Many young Chinese have responded with lifestyles such as “lying flat,” a term that describes opting for a stress-free, simple life.Bloggers who shared this way of living online recently saw their accounts banned and videos deleted.New expressions of discontent continue to appear online, such as “rat people,” a trend where young people describe themselves as avoiding the outside world by staying in bed and relying on food delivery.Popular platforms like Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu have also been punished for allowing “harmful” content, including celebrity gossip, to dominate trending lists.The regulator said it will also act against posts that spread fear, encourage hostility between groups, or promote “defeatist” ideas, such as “effort is useless.”It also warned against businesses that “sell anxiety” by exploiting people’s worries about jobs, education, or relationships.The regulator asked the public to “actively report such cases” in order to “stop the spread of negative sentiment.”Ja Ian Chong, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told CNN that many Chinese people feel pessimistic about their future.He said the government may be trying to boost confidence and spending by controlling public sentiment online. But he added that without real improvements in jobs and opportunities, changing online chatter may not change how people actually feel.“The state will try to clamp down on these new terms and expressions as they emerge, but they will simply continue to evolve,” Chong said.","China said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the communist party.

Baidu’s Apollo Go



WeRide



Pony.ai



“With this step, the RTA adds a new dimension to Dubai's public transport system,”





In a significant leap toward future-ready logistics, Dubai has officially introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for autonomous heavy vehicles. This move follows closely on the heels of permitting three Chinese firms — Baidu’s Apollo Go, WeRide, and Pony.ai — to begin testing driverless cars on public roads. The newly launched framework outlines licensing, safety, and operational protocols and is part of a broader strategy to transform Dubai’s land transport sector, double its economic output, and achieve 25% autonomous mobility by 2030.The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has finalized a comprehensive, two-phase regulatory framework to enable the safe and controlled deployment of autonomous heavy vehicles for logistics operations in Dubai. The framework, developed in collaboration with private sector partners, logistics firms, and retailers, sets the stage for the emirate’s entry into large-scale driverless freight mobility.These areas were selected for their importance to Dubai’s logistics ecosystem. During the pilot phase, some routes will be supervised by safety drivers, while others will operate fully without human drivers. This allows a dual approach to testing — balancing real-world integration with necessary oversight.The adoption of this regulatory framework reflects Dubai’s proactive governance model and commitment to transforming its logistics sector through automation and innovation.His Excellency Mattar Al Tayer, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of the RTA, said the initiative aligns with the vision of Dubai’s leadership to strengthen the emirate’s position as a global economic hub and directly supports the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33).Al Tayer said.Dubai’s land logistics sector currently comprises 61,290 heavy vehicles, ranging in weight from 3.5 to 65 tons. The framework has been designed to accommodate this existing fleet while laying the foundation for future autonomous deployments.Al Tayer also emphasized that Dubai is among the cities best prepared to implement self-driving transport, due to its advanced infrastructure, communication networks, and adherence to global standards.he added.The regulatory framework is a key element of the Dubai Land Commercial and Logistics Transport Strategy 2030, which aims to:This strategy is harmonized with six other specialized Dubai strategies:It also encompasses 17 key projects designed to fuel the sector’s growth and support innovation within logistics and freight transport. The broader aim is to regulate, modernize, and open up commercial transport to new technologies while embedding these goals into Dubai’s legislative and policy frameworks.The regulatory rollout builds on a major step taken just a week earlier, when Dubai's RTA granted testing permits to three Chinese autonomous driving companies:These firms have been authorized to conduct driverless vehicle trials on public roads in Dubai, marking the emirate’s first real-world deployment of passenger-focused autonomous cars.These trials were enabled through formal agreements signed earlier this year between the RTA and the companies. The vehicles will undergo rigorous testing to ensure they adapt efficiently to Dubai’s local environment, operating conditions, and traffic patterns. This development is also part of Dubai’s roadmap to launch self-driving taxi services.the authority noted, adding that autonomous solutions will complement existing modes while advancing toward the city’s smart mobility goals.By expanding partnerships with international leaders in autonomous driving, Dubai is reinforcing its global leadership in smart mobility and accelerating progress towards the 25% autonomous travel target by 2030.","Dubai’s new framework will pilot self-driving heavy trucks on five key logistics routes, aiming to boost efficiency and safety.

New Visa Rules for Umrah 2025: Saudi Arabia makes hotel and transport pre-booking mandatory for visa approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-visa-rules-for-umrah-2025-saudi-arabia-makes-hotel-and-transport-pre-booking-mandatory-forvisaapproval/articleshow/124195721.cms,"Saudi tightens Umrah visa rules, Pilgrims must pre-book hotels and transport

Saudi Arabia’s new Umrah visa rules 2025 explained



Step-by-step process to apply for an Umrah visa in 2025



Book accommodation with licensed hotels or through a registered operator. Use the Nusuk Umrah/Nusuk Masar portal or an accredited travel agency to make a verified reservation; casual or unverified bookings risk visa delays or rejection.

Arrange in-country transport (if required) and obtain confirmation. Many operators now include airport transfers and local transport in Umrah packages; keep receipts and booking references ready for the visa application.

Apply for the Umrah visa via the Nusuk portal or authorized channels. The Nusuk platform consolidates visa application, accommodation verification and permit scheduling; applicants should follow its instructions to avoid third-party bottlenecks.

Work with a vetted operator if you prefer package support. UAE-based tour operators are advising pilgrims to book full packages (hotel + transport + guidance) to streamline approvals and ensure on-ground services.

Essential travel tips for pilgrims visiting Makkah and Madinah

What to watch next





Saudi authorities now require Umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas, a rule intended to better manage pilgrim movement and prevent fraudulent accommodation offers. Umrah operators in the UAE are already urging travelers to complete these bookings preferably through Saudi’s official Nusuk platform or licensed agents before submitting visa applications.From this year, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and related authorities have tightened entry rules so that visa approval depends on proof of approved accommodation, typically hotel contracts verified through the Nusuk Masar / Nusuk Umrah platform and evidence of local transport arrangements. The move is part of a wider push to digitize and centralize Umrah services, requiring pilgrims to upload or link verified bookings before a visa is issued. Authorities say the change protects pilgrims from scams and improves crowd and accommodation management during busy periods.Expect slightly higher upfront planning costs because verified hotel and transport bookings must be made before visa issuance. Prices vary by season and hotel class; booking early often secures better rates and availability.If you’re flexible, choose off-peak slots and confirm cancellations/refund policies only verified, licensed contracts processed through Nusuk or accredited agents will reliably support visa approval. Operators also recommend allowing extra processing time during peak Islamic calendar dates.The rule tightens quality control and reduces fraud, but it also shifts pre-travel planning responsibility onto pilgrims and travel agents. For Saudi regulators, the change supports Vision 2030 goals to professionalize religious tourism and improve pilgrims’ safety and experience. For travelers, the key takeaway is simple: don’t apply for an Umrah visa without verified hotel and transport bookings, do it early and use Nusuk or licensed operators to avoid hiccups.",Saudi authorities now require umrah pilgrims to have confirmed hotel bookings and arranged transport when applying for visas.

When to watch: Supermoon and meteor-shower dates for the UAE



Hunter’s Supermoon — October 7, 2025. A bright full moon that will dominate the night sky.



Orionids meteor shower — peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris.



— peaks October 21–22, 2025. Best seen after midnight; this shower produces fast, bright meteors from Halley’s Comet debris. Beaver / Southern Taurids period & Supermoon — early November (Southern Taurids peak Nov 4–5) and Beaver Supermoon — November 5, 2025. Taurids are slower and produce occasional bright fireballs; the supermoon on Nov 5 will make faint meteors harder to see.



Leonids meteor shower — peaks November 17–18, 2025. Known for quick, bright streaks; best pre-dawn viewing.



Cold Supermoon — December 4, 2025. The last of the three consecutive supermoons.



Geminids meteor shower — peaks December 13–14, 2025. One of the year’s strongest showers (under perfect dark-sky conditions it can produce very high hourly rates and vivid colored trails).

How to watch and photograph: simple viewing and camera tips that work



Why it matters: a chance for science, community and striking photos

Quick wrap — what to pack and final checklist





The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the UAE: a run of three supermoons in October, November and December will be joined by major meteor showers - the Orionids, Leonids and Geminids giving skywatchers many clear nights to look up. Below is a compact, practical guide: exact dates, the best UAE spots to watch from, and simple photography and viewing tips so you don’t miss the action.At-a-glance calendar (local dates):(Notes: the term “supermoon” describes a full moon near its closest orbital approach; meteor-shower peaks are typically given as the nights when the highest activity is expected.For clear, memorable views head away from city lights. Popular UAE choices include the Al Qudra Desert, the Liwa dunes, the Hajar foothills and high vantage points such as Jebel Jais locations that give darker horizons and broader sky views than the city. Plan to arrive before dusk, scout a flat, safe spot, and bring warm layers for desert or mountain nights. Local guides and astronomy clubs often organize group viewings around major events, which is a good option if you prefer structured outings.Practical tip: supermoons are bright; they wash out faint meteors, so schedule meteor-watching for nights near new moons when possible (for example, the Orionids’ peak in late October benefits from darker skies).When a supermoon and a meteor peak coincide, expect fewer visible meteors.You don’t need equipment to enjoy the show, lie back, let your eyes dark-adapt for about 20–30 minutes, and scan the whole sky (meteors can appear anywhere). If you want to photograph meteors, use a tripod, shoot in manual mode with a wide-angle lens, open aperture (ideally f/2.8 or the widest your lens allows), a shutter of 10–30 seconds (use the 500/600 rule to avoid star trails) and an ISO in the 1600–3200 range; shoot many consecutive exposures rather than relying on a single long frame. These settings are a good starting point tweak for your camera and conditions. Bring a red torch to preserve night vision and shoot RAW for easier post-processing.If the moon is bright (supermoon nights), plan photography around the moonset or move focus to lunar photography. The large moon disk itself makes excellent landscape portraits when framed with dunes or mountain silhouettes.These back-to-back events are not just pretty nights; they are chances to connect with amateur astronomers, gather simple citizen-science observations (report fireballs to regional networks), and capture rare photos. The Geminids in mid-December are a highlight for photographers and families alike; the Orionids and Leonids offer quick, bright streaks that reward patience. In the UAE, where organized skywatching is growing, these events help build a community of observers and bring public attention to light-pollution and dark-sky conservationBring water, blankets or reclining chairs, a warm jacket, a red flashlight, a camera on a tripod (if shooting), and patience. Check local weather and moonrise/moonset times the day before, and follow astronomy-club updates for guided viewings. Clear sky nights in October–December 2025 will reward anyone who makes the short trip out of town.","The last three months of 2025 promise a rich sky show over the uae.

Investor outlook



How brands and visitors should approach the exhibition





From 30 September to 2 October 2025, the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI), in partnership with the Federation of Saudi Chambers, is staging the Omani–Saudi Franchise Exhibition at the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre in Muscat. More than 100 trademarks from Oman, Saudi Arabia and international firms will showcase franchise opportunities across food security, retail, industry, finance, legal and intellectual-property services, part commercial marketplace, part investment roadshow.Oman’s push to host a bilateral franchise fair signals a deliberate strategy: use franchising as a low-risk way to scale domestic brands, attract Saudi capital, and knit deeper commercial links across the Gulf. The OCCI’s broader franchising program which has already taken Omani brands to shows in India and Iraq and aims to internationalize dozens of homegrown trademarks frames this exhibition as a practical step toward Vision 2040 goals of diversification and job creation. The event is therefore as much about policy and pipelines as it is about storefronts.The three-day exhibition runs daily in the afternoon and evening (organizer hours list 13:00–21:00 Muscat time) and will host exhibitors from both countries plus international delegates.Organizers say more than 100 trademarks will be present, representing sectors such as food and retail, industrial services, financial and legal consulting, intellectual property and wider service categories. The show expects thousands of visitors including investors, franchisors, franchisees and trade delegations, an audience that organisers hope will convert interest into expansion agreements across the GCC.What matters for investors and brands is not the number of booths but the pipeline that follows. Look for three immediate outcomes: memoranda of understanding and agency deals that allow Oman and Saudi brands to open regional outlets; concrete franchise-development services (training, IP support and standardisation) from OCCI and partners; and follow-on financing or master-franchise agreements that turn exhibitor interest into on-the-ground outlets. Oman has precedent: OCCI’s recent international engagements have already produced agreements to expand Omani food brands abroad, showing how an exhibition can quickly translate into branch openings when paired with targeted follow-up.If you are a franchisor, use the exhibition to present a clear, investible package: audited P&L, standard operations manual, training modules and IP protections. Saudi investors will be scanning for scalable concepts with strong unit economics and local adaptation plans. For franchise seekers and entrepreneurs, the show is a chance to meet master-franchise holders, learn about territory rights, and compare service-provider offers (legal, IP and financial consulting) all in one place. Organizer pages list on-site registration and stand-booking options; expect the usual trade-show rhythm pitches, B2B meetings, and sector panels and plan follow-ups immediately after the fair.Seen from one angle this is a business expo; from another, it’s franchise diplomacy, a curated marketplace where Oman seeks investment, capacity and regional linkages without waiting years for greenfield projects. If effective, the exhibition will accelerate brand exports, create franchise jobs, and deepen Omani-Saudi commercial ties across several high-growth sectors. Watch for post-event MoUs and expansion announcements as the true measure of success.","Oman’s push to host a bilateral franchise fair signals a deliberate strategy: use franchising as a low-risk way to scale domestic brands.

What to watch next







On 27 September 2025, President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan received Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , at Qasr Al Shati in Abu Dhabi to discuss expanding cooperation on artificial intelligence research, practical applications and wider AI infrastructure in the UAE.The conversation at Qasr Al Shati focused on strengthening cooperation between OpenAI and UAE entities from joint research and pilot deployments to capacity-building and localized AI models. State and regional outlets report the meeting as part of the UAE’s push to partner with leading global AI labs to accelerate domestic AI capabilities and applications.Officials said the talks covered three practical themes: advancing AI research collaborations, exploring real-world AI use-cases across government and industry, and building the underlying infrastructure (data centers, compute capacity and language models tailored to Arabic). The UAE has publicly flagged ambitions to host large-scale AI campus projects and to develop Arabic-language AI tools making local partnerships with companies like OpenAI strategically important.This meeting fits a broader UAE strategy: move fast on AI by combining capital, policy support and foreign partnerships to secure technology, talent and infrastructure. Partnering with OpenAI signals the UAE’s aim to anchor advanced models, speed up deployment in education, health and government services, and raise its profile as an AI hub in the Middle East.It also signals to investors and regional partners that Abu Dhabi seeks both technological depth (labs, data centers) and practical adoption (pilot programs and regulation-friendly environments.Watch for: (a) formal memoranda of understanding or partnership agreements with UAE universities and research centers, (b) announcements about AI campus or data-center projects, (c) pilot projects in government services or healthcare, and (d) any joint work on Arabic-language models or workforce upskilling. Official confirmation of specific projects or timelines is likely to come through state news outlets and OpenAI statements in the coming weeks.The Qasr Al Shati meeting on 27 September 2025 put OpenAI in direct dialogue with the UAE’s top leadership — a step that blends prestige with purpose. It’s less a single announcement than a signaling move: Abu Dhabi wants to pair global AI capability with local ambition, and the concrete outcomes will be measured by follow-up agreements, campus and data-center developments, and any Arabic-model initiatives that emerge.","The uae has publicly flagged ambitions to host large-scale ai campus projects and to develop arabic-language ai tools.
