How the false donation story spread and why it’s suspicious

What actually happened in the Charlie Kirk case

In the wake of the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, false rumors began circulating online that several high-profile NFL players had donated large sums to his family. Social media posts claimed stars such as Jalen Hurts, Josh Allen , Aaron Rodgers, Travis Kelce , Nick Bosa, Malik Nabers, and Jordan Love each contributed $300,000 to support Kirk’s family. However, a thorough fact check reveals these reports are completely fabricated.The rumor first appeared across multiple unofficial websites and Facebook pages, many of which seemed designed to attract engagement rather than provide credible information. Lead Stories, a respected fact-checking organization, investigated the claims and flagged major red flags indicating fabrication.The fact-checkers pointed out that, “No Verifiable Sources, Anonymous Sources, Manufactured Quotes, Suspicious Financial Details, Missing Context, No Media Coverage, and Vague Future Claims.”Lead Stories highlighted that the article followed “the classic pattern of emotional manipulation, manufactured quotes, specific but unverifiable details, and no legitimate media corroboration.”Alarmingly, the fake stories were reportedly published from Vietnam, targeting an American audience while masquerading as credible news.Claude.ai, an AI-powered verification tool, also flagged the content as likely fabricated, further discrediting the viral narrative. The fact-check concluded that these stories were not grounded in fact but appeared designed to exploit a tragedy for social media traction.Charlie Kirk was shot during a Q&A session at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, was arrested the following night and is expected to be formally charged soon. While the tragedy has deeply shocked many, there is no public or verified evidence indicating NFL players made any monetary donations to Kirk’s family.Also Read: Controversy deepens as NFL permits teams to decide on honoring Charlie Kirk following assassination This incident underscores the importance of verifying information before spreading emotionally charged stories, especially involving high-profile tragedies.","False rumors began circulating online that several high-profile nfl players had donated large sums to charlie kirk's family.

Tips for creating high-quality AI Avatars

Be specific in your prompt: Include every relevant detail for the best results. Clear descriptions minimise errors and help the AI generate avatars that closely match your intended vision.

Experiment with styles: Try cartoon, anime, and realistic options to see which fits your vision. Exploring multiple styles allows you to discover unique looks that may better suit different platforms or purposes.

Combine methods: If available, use facial or pose editors after generation for extra customisation. Layering tools ensures greater precision, letting you fine-tune small details like expressions, gestures, or accessories.

Keep track of prompts: Save successful prompts for future avatar creations. Building a personal prompt library saves time, improves consistency, and makes it easier to recreate or refine specific designs later.

The highly anticipated launch has generated massive worldwide buzz across social media platforms, technology forums, industry panels, tech blogs, and consumer communities alike. Among notable reactions, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the iPhone Air, calling it the first Apple upgrade he’s genuinely excited about in years, highlighting its significance even to forward-thinking industry innovators and dedicated Apple fans worldwide.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter): “First new iPhone upgrade I have really wanted in awhile!

The front-facing camera incorporates the Center Stage sensor, similar to other models in the iPhone 17 lineup.For protection and style, two cases are available: a translucent case less than 1mm thick in frost and shadow shades, and a lightweight bumper case offered in all four phone colors.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Meanwhile, Musk, who appeared to have seen some of the videos, said in a post, “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the shooting of president donald trump aide charlie kirk quickly went viral across major social media platforms.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Satya Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said.“There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that,” the executive added.",Microsoft ceo satya nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce.

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly.

Here’s how you can create your own Google Gemini Nano Banana trend 3D figurine







Google Gemini has finally overtaken OpenAI’s popular chatbot ChatGPT to become the top-ranked app on both Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.",Albania has appointed an ai-powered minister to fight corruption.

In Saudi Arabia, the Iqama is more than just a residency permit — it is the central document that governs the life and work of every foreign national living in the Kingdom. From legal status to access to essential services, the Iqama plays a pivotal role in the everyday life of expatriates. This guide breaks down everything about the Iqama, from its purpose and benefits to the detailed process of obtaining and renewing it, including a breakdown of the associated costs.The Iqama is an official residency permit issued by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country. While a person can initially enter the Kingdom on a work visa, they are unable to legally access most services until the Iqama is issued.Once granted, the Iqama acts as proof of legal residency and work authorization. It is essential for accessing basic services and conducting day-to-day transactions in the Kingdom.Though the physical Iqama card is issued for five years, its legal validity depends on annual renewal, closely tied to the employment contract and the sponsoring company. If the sponsoring company ceases operations, the Iqama becomes invalid.In such a case, the expatriate must either find a new sponsor or leave the country.The Iqama issuance process is structured and primarily handled by the employer or business owner acting as the sponsor. Here’s how the process works:Holding an Iqama comes with recurring fees, which are usually covered by the employer. These include issuance charges, work permit fees, and dependent levies for family members.These figures apply annually and may vary if the residency period is shorter.

Indonesia mining: Government reopens nickel project in dive hotspot; environmentalists warn of damage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indonesia-mining-government-reopens-nickel-project-in-dive-hotspot-environmentalists-warn-of-damage/articleshow/123882992.cms,"



Jakarta: Indonesia has allowed a nickel mining company to resume operations in a pristine marine zone despite protests from activists and residents, according to AFP. The decision covers Gag island in the Raja Ampat archipelago of Southwest Papua Province, a world-renowned diving site located within the Coral Triangle.PT Gag Nikel, a subsidiary of state-owned Aneka Tambang, restarted operations on September 3 after the government lifted a suspension imposed earlier this year, the agency reported. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources confirmed the resumption, saying environmental audits had been carried out.Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said the firm had received a “green” rating from the government, signalling compliance with environmental standards. “We have once again reviewed all our data related to mining operations at Gag Nikel... An environmental audit was conducted to ensure that the impact caused by Gag Nikel can be properly mitigated,” he told reporters in Bali.Hanif added that authorities would continue to monitor and supervise operations. “Of course... there will always be concerns. That is why we must balance development and environmental protection,” he said.The government had in June revoked permits for four of five nickel mining companies in Raja Ampat after strong local opposition. Gag Nikel was initially exempted but was later suspended while environmental studies were undertaken, according to AFP.Environmental groups remain critical. Greenpeace Indonesia warned that nickel mining threatens the region’s biodiversity, home to three-quarters of the world’s known hard-coral species. “The environmental impact will be irreversible, potentially causing the island to sink due to the rising climate crisis. Eventually, we risk losing the island itself,” Greenpeace campaigner Arie Rompas was quoted as saying.According to Greenpeace, mining on Gag, Kawe and Manuran islands has already destroyed more than 500 hectares (1,200 acres) of forest and vegetation.Indonesia holds the world’s largest reserves of nickel and is the biggest producer of the mineral used in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Following a 2020 export ban, the sector has become central to the government’s industrial growth strategy.",Indonesia has allowed a nickel mining company to resume operations in a pristine marine zone.

The road ahead







In the aftermath of June's tragic Air India crash , two young engineers believe they may have found a way to make the skies safer with outside airbags for aeroplanes.The futuristic safety concept, called Project REBIRTH, has been shortlisted for the prestigious James Dyson Award, which honours groundbreaking inventions that can change the world.Designed by Eshel Wasim and Dharsan Srinivasan of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science's Dubai campus, the system uses artificial intelligence to predict imminent crashes and deploy protective airbags around the aircraft's fuselage, according to the James Dyson Award's official website. The idea, however unconventional, is simple: cushion the plane like a giant inflatable cocoon to turn otherwise fatal impacts into survivable landings.""Project REBIRTH is the first AI-powered crash survival system,"" the inventors explained. ""It deploys smart airbags, impact-absorbing fluids, and reverse thrust mid-air — turning fatal crashes into survivable landings.""The two engineers said the idea came after the Air India Flight 171 disaster in Ahmedabad in June, when a 787-8 Dreamliner crashed just seconds after takeoff, killing 241 of the 242 people on board.""After the June 2025 crash, my mother couldn't sleep,"" one of the creators recalled.

According to the trust, she has healed well under round-the-clock care.In the clip, Peter wears a black-and-white striped coat to mimic a zebra’s pattern. “Zebras are visual creatures and foals imprint on their mother’s striped pattern,” the trust explained, noting the coat allows Bombi to bond naturally while preventing over-attachment to a single human.The heart-warming video has gone viral, with many appreciating the nature of the job. ""I honestly think this has got to be the best job. I'm sure it's long hours, dirty, and smelly but my goodness, to be this loved by a zebra? Or an elephant?

GST revamp: Goods and services tax not applicable on these post-sale discounts; here is what experts say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-revamp-goods-and-services-tax-not-applicable-on-these-post-sale-discounts-here-is-what-experts-say/articleshow/123872817.cms,"Goyal Hails GST Reforms, Assures Industry Will Pass Benefits To Consumers, Says US Trade Talks On





The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing and driving sales, will not attract Goods and Services Tax GST ).In a circular, the board further explained that GST would, however, apply if such discounts are linked to specific promotional services carried out by dealers on behalf of the manufacturer, such as co-branding initiatives, advertising campaigns or customised sales drives.The clarification follows multiple representations received by the CBIC on the treatment of secondary or post-sale discounts under GST, PTI reported.According to the circular, dealers may sometimes engage in promotional efforts after receiving discounts, but these actions usually help them sell the goods they own and, in turn, increase their own earnings. In such situations, the board said, the discount functions only as a reduction in the sale price of goods rather than as consideration for a separate service.""Therefore, it is clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers in such cases shall not be treated as consideration for a separate transaction of supply of services,"" the CBIC circular stated.The tax will only apply, the board noted, if agreements explicitly state that dealers will perform promotional services like exhibitions, customised campaigns, advertising or customer support, with a defined payment for such activities.Commenting on the circular, AMRG & Associates senior partner Rajat Mohan pointed out that while dealers often run small marketing campaigns or quick sales drives, such efforts are usually undertaken to boost their own sales volumes.""The government has rightly clarified that these routine trade discounts cannot be treated as payment for any service provided by the dealer to the manufacturer, and therefore no additional GST liability arises in such cases,"" Mohan was quoted as saying by PTI.EY tax partner Saurabh Agarwal said the clarification rightly differentiates between a straightforward trade discount and a service transaction. He added that the position confirms that where the manufacturer-dealer relationship is on a principal-to-principal basis, discounts meant purely for sales promotion or competitive pricing cannot be viewed as payment for services.He also stressed that this move addresses a major source of confusion. ""In light of these clarifications, businesses must revisit their contractual arrangements and tax positions. The government's clear demarcation between trade discounts and promotional services will significantly reduce interpretational disputes and provide greater certainty in compliance for the industry, paving the way for a more streamlined GST regime,"" Agarwal told PTI.Grant Thornton Bharat partner Manoj Mishra noted that the CBIC’s guidance resolves a long-standing dispute. He highlighted that the assurance on input tax credit, which remains unaffected when financial or commercial credit notes are issued, eliminates a significant compliance risk for dealers.""From a practical standpoint, this puts the onus on businesses to carefully document agreements, credit notes, and customer-level pricing arrangements.”""Overall, the clarification is a pragmatic move that strengthens certainty, reduces litigation, and provides a workable framework for industry,"" Mishra said.","The central board of indirect taxes and customs (cbic) clarified that post-sale discounts offered by manufacturers to dealers, aimed purely at competitive pricing and driving sales, will not attract gst.

Chinese auto market: Govt unveils plan to 'stabilise' sector; emphasis on 'cost surveys and price monitoring',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinese-auto-market-govt-unveils-plan-to-stabilise-sector-emphasis-on-cost-surveys-and-price-monitoring/articleshow/123871975.cms,"



China rolled out a two-year plan aimed at easing turbulence in its car industry, where aggressive price cuts and trade disputes have weighed heavily on growth.State news agency Xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments. It places emphasis on “cost surveys and price monitoring” while urging carmakers to step up innovation and stimulate home demand.The sector is expected to see sales of about 32.3 million vehicles this year, a rise of 3%. That is slower than the 4.5% expansion recorded in 2024, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Beijing has funnelled significant funds into the electric vehicle sector, hoping to position the country as a global leader. The new plan sets an ambitious target of 15.5 million new energy vehicles to be sold in 2025, representing 20% year-on-year growth.Yet the industry is under pressure from a cut-throat price war. Cheap models and trade-in deals have flooded the market, pushing many smaller firms out of business. At a meeting in July, officials urged carmakers to abandon “irrational competition” in favour of healthy development.China’s drive to export more vehicles is also meeting resistance. The EU launched a probe in 2023 into possible unfair competition in the sector, and this week Mexico announced plans to hike tariffs on Chinese car imports to 50% from the current 15–20%, a decision that sparked an angry response from Beijing.","State news agency xinhua said the programme, covering 2025 and 2026, was issued jointly by eight government departments.
