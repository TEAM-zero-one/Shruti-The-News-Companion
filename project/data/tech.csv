The long-awaited winter update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills” DLC, is almost here. It arrives on December 10, 2025, and delivers one of the most significant character returns in the game’s history.This update is set to be much more than just a content pack, and it is a nostalgic trip that will bring back the iconic Michael De Santa into GTA Online. Besides the character’s return, the update also enables you to buy luxury mansions in the game.Here are all the details that you need to know about GTA Online’s A Safehouse in the Hills DLC.Michael's return is monumental for longtime fans of the franchise, given his absence was noticeable after GTA 5 concluded. The natural assumption for everyone was that Michael had achieved the retired Hollywood life he always desired. Nevertheless, the latest reveal trailer for A Safehouse in the Hills confirms that this theory is out the window.The trailer showcases an older Michael with white hair, suggesting that time has passed. However, he still possesses the volatile personality that defines him. This shows that he has aged, but has certainly not mellowed from his previous lifestyle.Michael's wife, Amanda De Santa, is also confirmed to appear, tying the protagonist's return to his infamously chaotic family life.While Rockstar has not given a full explanation of his role, Michael will likely be assisting players with new content centered on the mansions. There will possibly be a series of connected missions, or he will be simply providing advice.A Safehouse in the Hills DLC is launching on December 10, 2025, and it marks the first time you can purchase full-scale luxury mansions in GTA Online. These high-end properties are available for purchase in the coveted areas of Los Santos:These mansions are designed to make a full-power statement, featuring an array of luxury amenities: pools, helipads, hot tubs, garages, and expansive driveways. Inside them, you will also gain access to functional rooms like arcades, armories, vehicle workshops, and display podiums for their prized vehicles.Michael De Santa's involvement points towards the update being more focused on detailed storytelling and experience than what Rockstar typically releases. This would make A Safehouse in the Hills DLC among the best releases in GTA Online’s history.","The long-awaited winter update for gta online, titled “a safehouse in the hills” dlc, is almost here.

With updated figures for 2025 now available, fans are comparing which teammate leads in earnings, salary structure, and overall net worth.While the two play very different roles in the Chiefs’ success, both have become global sports brands with rapidly growing financial portfolios.As of 2025, both Mahomes and Kelce hold an estimated net worth of around $90 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The figures show how close their financial standings currently are, despite Mahomes signing a significantly larger playing contract.Kelce’s wealth comes from a blend of long-term endorsements, business ventures, and consistent All-Pro performances. Meanwhile, Mahomes’ meteoric rise, combined with major investment activity and one of the largest contracts in NFL history, has helped him build wealth rapidly.Mahomes currently holds one of the most lucrative deals in league history, a 10-year extension worth over $450 million, signed in 2020.His contract is structured with roster bonuses, proration adjustments, and incentives tied to MVP and championship performances. For the 2025 season, Mahomes’ base salary sits at $1,255,000, with over $21 million in prorated bonuses added to his cap figure.Kelce, on the other hand, signed a two-year, $34.25 million extension in 2024, which keeps him with the Chiefs through 2025. He earns an average annual salary of $17,125,500, including guarantees and roster bonuses.

Also read:

As the Buffalo Sabres continue to carry with their three goalies on their active roster, which includes Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, Alex Lyon, and Colten Ellis, the goaltending situation at the team might change as the team may be approaching a turning point. Reports suggest that Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams will have to make at least one goaltending move, and probably two, before the next season clears out the logjam.Meanwhile, rumors are doing the rounds that the Montreal Canadiens and the Edmonton Oilers have emerged as potential trading partners for Sabres goalie Luukkonen. While the situation remains uncertain, the interest appears serious, with both teams reportedly monitoring the situation closely. Let’s take a close look at the speculations that are currently hovering around the team.The Buffalo Sabres are still operating with three goaltenders, however, the setup may not last much longer, as the Buffalo Sabres are expected to move Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen.As per reports, the Montreal Canadiens and Edmonton Oilers have reportedly shown interest in Luukonen, and it has also come to light that the general manager, Kevyn Adams, is expected to make possibly two goalie-related moves before next season to resolve the growing roster congestion.Meanwhile, David Pagnotta of the Fourth Period stated, ""This may be something to look at around the draft... and this isn't the first time UPL's name has come up. But with what's going on in Buffalo, with who they've got right now, with Levi coming up, I think there's an appetite to seriously look at moving him again.""At the start of the 2025-26 campaign, Luukkonen missed several matches because of injury. He has compiled a 2.51 goals against average and a .899 save percentage across eight games (seven starts) this season.According to the NHL , Luukkonen has signed a $23.75 million extension deal through 2028-29 after a 2023–24 campaign that saw a 2.57 goals-against average (GAA) and .910 save percentage that made him a promising rising star in the league.However, his recent form has been very inconsistent as the goaltender has posted a 2.51 GAA and .899 save percentage in the 2025–26 season so far, across eight games (seven starts). Meanwhile, over the past two seasons, his combined save percentage has dipped to .888, and he ranks near the bottom of active NHL goaltenders as well, which is making the analysts believe that trading Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen will be good for the Buffalo Sabres to create opportunity between the pipes.","Buffalo sabres expected to move ukko-pekka luukkonen, as montreal and edmonton show interest.

He Made $26M on YouTube...But Nearly Lost It All (Linus Tech Tips Interview)





Popular tech YouTuber Linus Sebastian recently offered a rare insight into the financial earnings and business strategies behind his uber successful channel Linus Tech Tips. In a new interview with Jon Youshaei, Sebastian opened up not just staggering numbers the channel has pulled in, but also about the financial infrastructure that keeps Linus Media Group stable and evolving with time.The conversation clearly shows how Sebastian's sharp wit and intellect shaped his empire. One can witness the inspirational journey of how a channel with nine billion lifetime views has slowly evolved into a multi-stream business that does not solely depend on ads. The company is currently thriving, and Sebastian credits his supporters for all it has achieved so far.At the four-minute mark of Youshaei’s video, Sebastian invited him into his YouTube Studio dashboard. That’s when Youshaei started reading out the staggering achievements of Sebastian’s channel, including nine billion lifetime views, reaching a peak of 8.4 million views in a single day, and “over $26.3 million” earned through AdSense.When asked if the $26.3 million was made through his individual effort, Sebastian quickly clarified that it was made possible through the company. He said, “I haven’t. Linus Media Group, Inc. has done $26 million in revenue through YouTube AdSense… Linus Media Group has paid more than $26 million in salaries.”Later in the video, the pair went deeper into the channel’s revenue breakdown, including from YouTube Adsense (11.6%), Fully Branded Videos (12.5%), Products (55.4%), Memberships (7.2%), Sponsorships (9.2%), etc. Sebastian gave a shoutout to his supporters who have been substantial in his success story, stating,He stated, “Those are from our incredible supporters… And we have over 40,000 of them right now.And they’re awesome, and I can count on that. YouTube AdSense, I can count on that to a degree, but it’s more volatile.” He also added that FloatPlane “never has a spike, but it never really has a big dip. It's been pretty consistent growth overall.”Interestingly, this new interview comes months after Sebastian acknowledged a drop in the channel’s viewership in September 2025. Rather than seeing it as a setback, Sebastian continued to work hard, strategized ways to battle fluctuation and come back strong, ultimately building his business to new heights.Also read: Why are fans questioning Pokimane’s relationship status amid celibacy rumors?

The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software,” wrote Zuckerberg.

Dye’s legacy at Apple





Facebook-parent Meta has announced the appointment of Alan Dye, one of Apple ’s most influential design leaders. Dye will head the newly created creative studio inside its Reality Labs division. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this announcement on social media platform Threads. Dye who has been instrumental in shaping Apple’s design language since past two decades will now help Meta in defining the “next generation of products and experiences” as the company pushes deeper into AI-powered devices and spatial computing.In his announcement, Zuckerberg said the new studio will merge design, fashion, and technology, treating intelligence as “a new design material” to imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered.Dye played an important role in shaping Apple’s design journey. Since taking over Apple’s design studio in 2015, he helped shape the look and feel of flagship products including the Apple Watch, iPhone X, and the Vision Pro headset. Most recently, he oversaw Liquid Glass, Apple’s new interface design that gives UI elements a transparent, fluid aesthetic.Bloomberg, which first reported his move, noted that Dye’s team also worked on upcoming smart home hardware.","Alan dye, one of apple’s most influential design leaders, is leaving apple for meta.

Anthropic revenue grows 10x annually: Amodei







Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has spoken on the highly discussed massive spending in the intelligence space. Speaking at this year's DealBook Summit, Amodei addressed concerns about whether hundreds of billions of dollars being poured into AI data centres will pay off. He acknowledged that the industry is taking on “considerable risk” by such a splash out on infrastructure, but expressed confidence that the technology will ultimately deliver economic value.Replying to a question on overspending and whether “the math of all of this makes sense,” Amodei drew a distinction between technological and economic considerations.“So this is really complicated, and I want to separate out the technological side of it from the economic side of it,"" Amodei said.“On the technological side of it, I feel really solid. I think I'm one of the most bullish people around, and I think it pencils out,” he added. He highlighted that as models are trained using relatively simple methods with minor modifications, “they get better and better at every task under the sun.”Amodei pointed to Anthropic’s own performance as evidence of AI's economic potential. He said the company focuses heavily on enterprise clients and serves as a reliable indicator of the technology's value.“We look at our revenue. It's grown 10x a year, every year for the last three years,” Amodei said, suggesting that the company may be “a purer barometer than the others, which filter through consumers, which kind of have their habits and their use cases.”While acknowledging uncertainty about whether the explosive growth will continue, Amodei expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory. “Will it continue? I don't know. But the technology is driving there and the economic value is coming with it,” he said.He also predicted that the current growth trend “is going to slow down for sure, but it's still going to be really fast.”","Amodei separates technology from economics at dealbook summit.

Owens alleges Kirk orchestrated a controversial livestream attempt, accusing TPUSA of changing terms and controlling the narrative.

Candace Owens alleges that Erika Kirk orchestrated TPUSA livestream drama





The heated clash between conservative commentator Candace Owens and Turning Point USA has taken an unexpected turn, with Owens now aiming her criticism directly at Erika Kirk, the widow of the late TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk . What began as a disagreement over scheduling a livestream to address Owens’ allegations about Kirk’s killing has now spilled into a conversation about leadership, transparency, and who is truly calling the shots at TPUSA.Owens insists she never backed out of speaking publicly, but claims the organization attempted to control the narrative by changing terms at the last minute and refusing to let her join virtually. Now she’s questioning Erika Kirk’s role in it all.The dispute escalated after TPUSA member Blake Neff claimed Owens declined their invitation to speak live on The Charlie Kirk Show. Neff argued the group was not “booking a guest” but simply offering Owens a chance to respond to accusations against her.Owens countered by saying TPUSA changed the conditions after she agreed, demanding she appear in person in Phoenix at a time that clashed with her own podcast. She maintains she was misled about both timing and format.She later announced that if TPUSA insisted on speaking during her regular streaming slot, she would not back down, writing, “It has been decided by the public that the best response for this is for my team to livestream your livestream and provide commentary.”Owens insisted she had never refused to speak, only refused to play by new rules imposed without discussion.Then came the statement that shocked many: Owens accused Erika Kirk of directing TPUSA to set up the livestream and push the confrontation forward. On her podcast and on X, Owens wrote, “TPUSA says it was Erika Kirk who directed them to host a livestream. Did she approve of the letter Blake read?” The question implied not only involvement, but responsibility for a message Owens considers misleading.Erika Kirk, now CEO of TPUSA, has not issued a response. With Owens continuing to suggest the organization betrayed Charlie Kirk’s legacy, the conservative movement finds itself facing a very public divide and neither side appears ready to back down.Also Read: Candace Owens accuses TPUSA of playing games with livestream invite, says the group hasn’t felt “sincere” since Charlie’s death","Conservative commentator candace owens has escalated her dispute with turning point usa, now targeting erika kirk.

Candace Owens Explodes; Claims Tpusa Staffer Hid Charlie Kirk’s ‘Death Text’

Candace Owens says TPUSA changed the rules and then blamed her for refusing to appear





The tension between Candace Owens and Turning Point USA continues to build, and her latest comments suggest this is about more than politics or personality clashes. Owens is calling out the organization for what she sees as misleading behavior surrounding a livestream they invited her to join.What might seem like a simple scheduling issue has turned into a bigger conversation about trust and transparency inside TPUSA since the death of Charlie Kirk. Owens’ frustration is clear, and her latest post makes it sound like she believes something has changed within the group and not for the better.The back-and-forth started when TPUSA’s Blake Neff shared a post claiming Owens declined their offer to join a livestream conversation. Neff wrote, “She was given the opportunity to join and declined.” But Owens says that version of the story leaves out important details.According to her, the original offer didn’t demand an immediate response or an in-person appearance. She explained, “You literally said ‘we would SINCERELY welcome her participation in that livestream’ which you were clear your team would be streaming from your studio in Phoenix at a date that had not been decided.”Owens says the invitation suddenly shifted into strict requirements she never agreed to. “You never said, ‘she MUST be in-person for the stream and she MUST respond within 24 hours after we choose a date and time.’”What frustrates her most is what she sees as dishonesty in how TPUSA publicly presented the situation. She wrote, “There was nothing sincere about what you did following that announcement and you deserve the ratio you’re getting.”Owens then added something more personal: “Frankly, nothing has felt sincere about the organization since Charlie passed.”Her words cut deeper than a simple disagreement over logistics, suggesting grief, confusion, and trust issues are playing out in real time. This doesn’t look like a fight either side plans to end quietly.Also Read: Blake Neff rejects Candace Owens’ offer to join Charlie Kirk's TPUSA livestream virtually, pushes forward with Kirk livestream alone","Candace owens publicly accused turning point usa of misleading behavior regarding a livestream invitation.

A new jaguar spotted in Arizona points to progress in the endangered species' recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-new-jaguar-spotted-in-arizona-points-to-progress-in-the-endangered-species-recovery/articleshow/125793811.cms,"Photo credit- AP





The spots gave it away. Just like a human fingerprint, the rosette pattern on each jaguar is unique so researchers knew they had a new animal on their hands after reviewing images captured by a remote camera in southern Arizona.The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The animal was captured by the camera as it visited a watering hole in November, its distinctive spots setting it apart from previous sightings.""We're very excited. It signifies this edge population of jaguars continues to come here because they're finding what they need,"" Susan Malusa, director of the center's jaguar and ocelot project, said during an interview Thursday.The team is now working to collect scat samples to conduct genetic analysis and determine the sex and other details about the new jaguar, including what it likes to eat. The menu can include everything from skunks and javelina to small deer.As an indicator species, Malusa said the continued presence of big cats in the region suggests a healthy landscape but that climate change and border barriers can threaten migratory corridors.She explained that warming temperatures and significant drought increase the urgency to ensure connectivity for jaguars with their historic range in Arizona.More than 99% of the jaguar's range is found in Central and South America, and the few male jaguars that have been spotted in the U.S. are believed to have dispersed from core populations in Mexico, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials have said that jaguar breeding in the U.S. has not been documented in more than 100 years.Federal biologists have listed primary threats to the endangered species as habitat loss and fragmentation along with the animals being targeted for trophies and illegal trade.The Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule in 2024, revising the habitat set aside for jaguars in response to a legal challenge. The area was reduced to about 1,000 square miles (2,590 square kilometers) in Arizona's Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties.Recent detection data supports findings that a jaguar appears every few years, Malusa said, with movement often tied to the availability of water. When food and water are plentiful, there's less movement.In the case of Jaguar #5, she said it was remarkable that the cat kept returning to the area over a 10-day period. Otherwise, she described the animals as quite elusive.""That's the message - that this species is recovering,"" Malusa said. ""We want people to know that and that we still do have a chance to get it right and keep these corridors open.""",The university of arizona wild cat research and conservation center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area.

What is actually happening with the Warner Bros deal

Warner Bros film studios

HBO and HBO Max programming

DC Entertainment and its film and TV franchises

A vast international distribution and licensing network

A political flashpoint in a historic media shift





MAGA activist Laura Loomer has reignited controversy after warning that Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery could transform the streaming giant into what she calls the “Obama News Network. ” Her claims resurfaced shortly after Netflix announced on 5 December 2025 that it had reached an agreement to purchase Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming assets in a deal valued between $72 billion and $83 billion. The merger, which includes HBO, Warner Bros Pictures and DC Entertainment, is one of the largest entertainment acquisitions in modern history.Netflix says the takeover will strengthen its global content strategy and give audiences a unified platform combining blockbuster franchises with premium drama and international originals. Critics, however, including Loomer, see deeper political implications.In a piece published on her website Loomered, Loomer argued that the Obamas have been quietly rebuilding political influence through their production company Higher Ground, which signed a multimillion-dollar content deal with Netflix in 2018. She claims that the Warner Bros Discovery purchase would expand their reach by placing HBO and other premium outlets under the same corporate umbrella as Higher Ground’s existing partnership with Netflix.According to Loomer, the Obamas’ increased public visibility in recent months is part of a calculated effort to prepare for what she describes as a significant consolidation of media power. She points to Michelle Obama’s recent media appearances and Barack Obama’s criticism of President Trump as signs of a coordinated re-emergence.Loomer also cites political donations made by senior Netflix figures. She highlights CEO Ted Sarandos’ fundraising history for Barack Obama and Democratic candidates, Reed Hastings’ financial contributions to Democrat-led political efforts, and Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria’s involvement in Biden-Harris events. In Loomer’s view, these ties indicate that the merger would create a political and cultural pipeline aligned with Democratic interests.Higher Ground’s past productions, including Becoming, American Factory, Crip Camp, We the People and Leave the World Behind, are framed by Loomer as left-leaning content that reflects the Obamas’ worldview. She argues that these projects promote themes of grievance and structural injustice, which she believes signal a broader ideological agenda that could shape media narratives if Netflix secures control of Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming assets.Loomer concludes that the acquisition would consolidate streaming, Hollywood production and prestige television under one dominant platform, a scenario she believes could influence political messaging ahead of future elections.Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery follows months of speculation and a multi-company bidding war that included Paramount and Comcast. The deal gives Netflix ownership of:CNN is not included among the assets being sold to Netflix. Warner Bros Discovery is planning to spin off its cable and linear networks, including CNN, into a separate company often referred to in reporting as Discovery Global. Those news and cable assets will remain distinct from the studio and streaming businesses that Netflix has agreed to acquire, so CNN will continue as a separate news business rather than becoming part of Netflix’s portfolio.The acquisition still requires regulatory approval in the US and Europe. Lawmakers, including Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, have raised concerns about the merger creating an entertainment monopoly. Industry groups are also questioning what this means for theatrical releases, creative independence and competition within the streaming market.Netflix has said it intends to maintain Warner Bros’ theatrical commitments and preserve HBO’s identity as a premium storytelling brand. The company argues that the merger will boost investment in large-scale productions and international content, citing recent examples such as the ambitious Argentine sci-fi series The Eternaut.While Loomer’s argument is rooted in political critique, the broader conversation reflects anxiety across multiple sectors. Traditional cinema advocates fear further decline in theatrical box office revenue. Creators are concerned about how algorithm-driven decisions might affect artistic risk-taking. Political commentators, meanwhile, are questioning the influence of corporate media consolidation on public discourse.What remains clear is that Netflix’s acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery marks a defining moment for the entertainment industry. Whether it becomes the foundation for what Loomer calls an “Obama News Network” or simply a new phase of global streaming competition is a debate that will continue to unfold as regulators, politicians and audiences respond to a merger of unprecedented scale.",Activist laura loomer has warned that netflix’s acquisition of warner bros discovery could transform the streaming giant into what she calls the “obama news network. ” her claims resurfaced shortly after netflix announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase warner bros’ studio and streaming assets in a deal valued between $72 billion and $83 billion.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125792403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-601354,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Meet Dubai's Ferrari Purosangue Mansory

Strategic supercar policing

Beyond speed





Dubai Police has once again elevated its globally recognized luxury patrol fleet, unveiling an ultra-rare, customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory, a 755-horsepower powerhouse that is one of only seven units modified worldwide. Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence. He stated that the new patrol will operate across major tourist hubs to assist visitors and strengthen community engagement.The luxury patrols are mobile service units, ensuring a highly visible and approachable presence where the police force can interact directly with residents and millions of visitors.The new Ferrari Purosangue Mansory will be immediately deployed in key tourist zones, including the Burj Khalifa, Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard, and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR). By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai police unveils 755hp ferrari suv for patrols.

Four people have been arrested in South Korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses and stealing footage to produce illegally filmed sexually exploitative content, the Washington Post reported citing officials.The Korean National Police Agency said the suspects operated independently and targeted a variety of IP cameras, including those in private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio, and a gynaecologist’s clinic.Two of the suspects were responsible for more than 60% of the videos posted on an overseas-based website where the footage was sold. One suspect reportedly received around $24,000 in virtual assets for 545 videos, while another earned $12,000 for 648 videos. Another suspect allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won in virtual assets, the BBC reported.According to the NY Post, authorities have not disclosed the manufacturers of the hacked cameras. The website where the footage was sold, as well as those who viewed the videos, is also under investigation. Police have arrested three people suspected of purchasing or viewing the stolen material.One suspect is additionally charged with producing sexually exploitative content of children and adolescents, though police said this footage had been stored but not sold. All four are charged with hacking IP cameras, and two face further charges of selling illegally filmed sexual content.Authorities emphasised that weak passwords played a key role in the hack, with many cameras using simple or sequential combinations, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. The National Police Agency urged all IP camera users to set complex, original passwords, update them regularly, and be cautious about using devices manufactured overseas, which may not meet local security standards.IP cameras, often used for monitoring children, pets, and businesses, have become popular globally due to their low cost but are increasingly targeted by hackers. Previous incidents include a 2019 US case in Mississippi where a man hacked a child’s Ring camera and harassed the child via the device’s two-way talk function, and a 2024 FTC fine on Verkada after footage from 150,000 cameras, including those in hospitals and schools, was stolen, reported The Washington Post.“Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,” the BBC cited the National Police Agency as saying.According to the NY Post, South Korea has a long-standing problem with “molka,” or hidden cameras, which have been used to produce illegal sexual content in public spaces. Between 2011 and 2022, police made nearly 50,000 arrests related to illicit filming in hotels, pools, and public bathrooms. The widespread use of hidden cameras has also been a catalyst for the country’s feminist movement.Police have visited or notified victims at 58 locations, providing guidance on deleting footage and strengthening security. They are also cooperating with foreign authorities to investigate the website operator and users who accessed the stolen material. “IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,” BBC quoted Park Woo-hyun, cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.","Four people have been arrested in south korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses.

Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from december 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.
