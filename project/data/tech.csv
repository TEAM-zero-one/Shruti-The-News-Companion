'It's an exciting time to be part of space exploration': Peggy Whitson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/its-an-exciting-time-to-be-part-of-space-exploration/articleshow/121421855.cms,"You've seen spaceflight evolve dramatically. How different is the landscape now?



How do you maintain physical and mental health during extended space missions?



You've conducted many spacewalks. What's one challenge that truly caught you off guard?



What makes the Axiom-4 mission stand out?

Veteran astronaut Peggy Whitson is no stranger to firsts. She’s spent more days in space than any other American, and is now leading Axiom-4 mission to ISS. In an interview to TOI’s Chethan Kumar, Whitson talks about adapting to life in orbit, rise of commercial spaceflight, and why diversity will shape the future of space exploration. Excerpts:It's changed a lot. When I started, spaceflight was almost entirely govt-led. Now, companies like Axiom Space are transforming how we explore space. They're not only accelerating innovation but also opening doors for more people and more science ... It's an exciting time to be involved in space exploration.Staying healthy in space is a top priority. We follow a strict exercise routine to counteract the effects of microgravity - things like muscle loss and bone density reduction. Nutrition is key, too. Mentally, staying sharp means staying connected with loved ones and keeping ourselves intellectually engaged. Whether it's science, reading, or crew activities, it's about finding ways to stay focused and fulfilled. The ground team's support and the camaraderie with fellow astronauts play a huge role.During one spacewalk, we unexpectedly lost a thermal and micrometeoroid shield. Despite meticulous planning, space has its surprises.The shield drifted away, and we had to rely on the ground team's rapid thinking to come up with a workaround.Ax-4 is setting a new benchmark. We're conducting more research studies than any private ISS mission before. It's not just about science-it's about international collaboration... And for countries like India, which have bold space ambitions, missions like this demonstrate how commercial partnerships can help achieve those goals faster.","Veteran astronaut peggy whitson has spent more days in space than any other american.

iPhone's US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company.

The connections between the words might be thematic, categorical, or linguistic. Popular for its mix of logic, language skills and occasional trickery, it’s become a fan-favourite puzzle that resets each day at midnight.You are presented with 16 words and must group them into four sets of four based on a shared connection. These groups might be straightforward (like colours or animals) or involve more subtle wordplay (such as changing a letter). Select four words you believe belong together and click “submit.” If correct, the group is locked in. You have four chances before the game ends. Use the shuffle option to reorganize the board, which can help reveal new connections.Yellow group — Items in a linen closet:PILLOWCASE, SHEET, TOWEL, WASHCLOTHGreen group — Diametric (words meaning opposite):COUNTER, OPPOSITE, POLAR, REVERSEBlue group — Lingerie:GARTER, HOSE, SLIP, TEDDYPurple group — Card games with first letter changed:DIN (Gin), FRIDGE (Bridge), GUMMY (Rummy), JOKER (Poker)The yellow group was fairly straightforward: these are all soft, fabric-based items commonly found in a household linen closet.The green group involved conceptual opposites, with each word representing some form of contrast or reversal.The blue group leaned into fashion, specifically intimate apparel or lingerie, which made for a cohesive theme but may have tricked those unfamiliar with the terms.The purple group was the hardest of all, relying on wordplay—each word is a spoof of a well-known card game with the first letter changed.

"MrBeast net worth hits $1 billion, YouTuber becomes world's youngest self-made billionaire at age 27",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/mrbeast-net-worth-hits-1-billion-youtuber-becomes-worlds-youngest-self-made-billionaire-at-age-27/articleshow/121345967.cms,"How MrBeast has become successful over the years



MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey! Anyway I could get you in a video? 👀” he said in a post on X.","Jimmy donaldson, also known as mrbeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with celebrity net worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs 2025: over 61,000 jobs cut as microsoft, google, amazon, and crowdstrike reshape workforce.

"Donald Trump to Apple: That's Okay, you go to India but you're not going to sell in America without ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-to-apple-thats-okay-you-go-to-india-but-youre-not-going-to-sell-in-america-without-/articleshow/121404080.cms,"Poll Do you think tariffs will help boost US manufacturing jobs in the long term? No, it will hurt the economy. Yes, definitely.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Donald Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Donald Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","Us president donald trump announced that apple can build factories in india but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the us if manufactured overseas.

WhatsApp scam: Sending a 'Funny Meme' can now help hackers empty your bank account,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/whatsapp-scam-sending-a-funny-meme-can-now-help-hackers-empty-your-bank-account/articleshow/121410908.cms,"Representatiev image

How the new WhatsApp scam works

How to protect yourself from this WhatsApp scam

Key preventive measures include:

Verify Senders : Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting.

: Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting. Avoid Unknown Downloads: Refrain from downloading any images or attachments from suspicious or unverified sources.

Report Scam Messages: If you receive a message that you suspect is a scam, report it to WhatsApp and block the sender immediately.

A new type of WhatsApp scam is now doing the rounds on the internet. A seemingly innocent act –downloading a funny meme or image on WhatsApp – could be the gateway for fraudsters to compromise your entire digital life, from your bank account to your most private photos. The new scam works on the common habit of sharing and downloading images shared on WhatsApp. Users receive an image, seemingly harmless and perhaps even from a known contact, which, upon download, unleashes malware or spyware onto their mobile device. The deceptive nature of the attack lies in its ability to bypass traditional suspicions, as users are less likely to question content that appears to be a simple picture or meme.Users will receive a meme or image from an unknown number or their own phone contact whose phone may be already compromised. Once the user downloads the image, the malware silently installs on their phone allowing the hackers to steal their banking credentials, social media passwords and also their personal photos.The images shared by hackers often contain some hidden QR codes that redirect the users to phishing websites and expose them to financial fraud. The scam spreads as users unknowingly forward infected images, making them carriers of the malware.Cybersecurity experts are urging WhatsApp users to exercise extreme caution to avoid falling victim to this scam. Pranav Patil, Chief Data Scientist, AdvaRisk told Economic Times, “In today’s world, where messaging apps are ubiquitous, scammers are increasingly turning to social engineering tactics to exploit users. The WhatsApp image download scam is a prime example. Hence the reason why you should disable auto-downloads of any type of media files on WhatsApp. Only download images or files from sources/senders you trust.""","A new type of whatsapp scam is now doing the rounds on the internet.

Struggling German steel giant Thyssenkrupp plans major overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/struggling-german-steel-giant-thyssenkrupp-plans-major-overhaul/articleshow/121417947.cms,"Representative Image

'Dramatic situation'





FRANKFURT: Thyssenkrupp said Monday it planned a major overhaul that will split the vast conglomerate into several standalone businesses, fuelling fears about further job losses and a looming break-up of the historic German industrial titan.Once a symbol of German manufacturing might, Thyssenkrupp has fallen into crisis in recent years as high costs at home, falling prices for its products and fierce competition from Asian rivals hammered its traditional steel business in particular.The conglomerate, which traces its history back to the early 19th century, had already announced massive job cuts at the steel division and was in the process of seeking to spin off some parts of the business.The plan announced Monday goes further however, and involves gradually making all segments of the group -- ranging from auto parts to green technologies -- into standalone businesses and opening them up for outside investment.The current Thyssenkrupp group would be transformed into a holding company with stakes in the individual businesses.Chief executive Miguel Lopez said the plan, to be presented to the supervisory board before the end of September, will help the group continue on its ""chosen course"".""The future independence of our current segments... will increase their entrepreneurial flexibility, strengthen their investment plans and earnings responsibility, and improve transparency for investors,"" he said in a statement.The move principally affects the group's automotive technology and green technology units as well as one that deals with supply chain management.The aim is for them to become independent businesses in the coming years, with Thyssenkrupp to retain a controlling stake.Efforts were already ongoing to spin off its lucrative submarine-making unit, and Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky has taken a 20-percent stake in the steel business, with the goal of increasing this to 50 percent.Investors cheered the news, with Thyssenkrupp's shares up more than eight percent in afternoon trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.But there was anger at what some viewed as the looming demise of a well-known German manufacturing giant, which has almost 100,000 employees worldwide, as well as fears about more job cuts.""Germany's industrial icon faces being dismantled, thousands of jobs are at risk,"" said the tabloid newspaper Bild.It reported that the number of staff at the group's Essen headquarters would be slashed from 500 to 100. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on the report.Politicians voiced anger at the potential impact in North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Germany's biggest steelmaker has major operations and is a big employer.Dennis Radtke, a European Parliament lawmaker from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU party, warned of a ""dramatic situation for the entire value chain in the steel industry"" if the restructuring plan goes ahead.R adtke, originally from the region, told Stern magazine that swift action was needed to ""avoid carnage that would make us even more dependent on China... the chancellor must make the issue a top priority"".China has become a major competitor to traditional European steelmakers in recent years.A spokesman for the North Rhine-Westphalia state said it was ""closely monitoring"" the latest developments at Thyssenkrupp.The state government's ""actions are focused on securing jobs at ThyssenKrupp... and throughout the steel industry and related value chains"", he told AFP.Thyssenkrupp has reported massive annual losses for the past two years running. In November last year it announced plans to cut about 11,000 jobs at the steel division -- over a third of the workforce.","Thyssenkrupp plans major overhaul that will split conglomerate into several standalone businesses.

Content creation has evolved into a powerful business. What once started as a form of self-expression for young individuals has now paved the way for a new generation of digital entrepreneurs—ranging from influencers and vloggers to solopreneurs building full-fledged media ventures.Before long, Dubai—once primarily a social media stopover for light-hearted content and globe-trotting influencers—has begun its transformation into one of the world’s most structured creator economies.Over the past three years, the city has reimagined its global appeal—not just as a centre for finance or tourism but as a serious contender in the rapidly expanding creator economy.A growing number of creators are now establishing their base in Dubai, attracted by its business-friendly regulations, advanced digital infrastructure, and a deliberate government push to formalise and scale the influencer industry.Gaurav Taneja, a former commercial pilot turned YouTube megastar – known as Flying Beast - has gone on record to state that Dubai is one of the few places where creators are treated as entrepreneurs, not just entertainers with cameras.And rightly so; creators today are entrepreneurs running businesses that encompass multiple aspects, including production, distribution, and marketing.What helps is platforms like Creator HQ , developed by the Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy in collaboration with Dubai Media City. It is a purpose-built platform for the creator economy.It delivers end-to-end support—from streamlined freelance visas and production-ready workspaces to legal guidance, brand partnerships, and business training—designed to help digital creators scale their ventures professionally.The model is built to help digital talent grow—not just followers but sustainable revenue models.“It’s about turning influence into income, and income into impact,” stated a spokesperson from Dubai Chamber. Creator HQ aims to support up to 10,000 influencers and digital entrepreneurs by offering a suite of services—including streamlined freelance visas, production-ready workspaces, legal guidance, brand partnerships, and business training. The initiative is designed to help creators evolve from content to commerce—with support across licensing, relocation, and monetisation models tailored to the UAE’s digital economy.South Asian creators—particularly from India—form a significant share of Dubai’s growing digital talent pool. What makes the city especially attractive is a rare combination of proximity, perception, and profitability.With a flight time of under 3.5 hours from India, zero personal income tax, and one of the most advanced digital infrastructures in the Middle East, Dubai offers a compelling value proposition for creators looking to scale regionally and globally.“Every city sells a dream,” says Prajakta Koli, aka MostlySane, one of India’s most beloved YouTubers. “But Dubai gives you a studio, a setup, a strategy, and safety—all in one. It’s not just aspirational; it’s operational.”For many mid-tier influencers—those with 100,000 to 1 million followers—Dubai is also a growth hack. With access to regional and global audiences across Asia, Africa, and Europe, the UAE offers distribution diversity that’s both algorithmically and commercially valuable.Dubai’s creator infrastructure goes beyond visas and brand deals. The emirate’s free zones—like Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and Dubai Studio City—function as plug-and-play environments for tech and media professionals.“These free zones give us more than just tax relief,” explains Nuseir Yassin, founder of Nas Daily. “They offer creative freedom with minimal red tape, the ability to own 100% of your business and a mindset that encourages experimentation.”Yassin, whose short-form storytelling empire now spans multiple countries, set up his base in the UAE precisely for this reason. Dubai’s regulatory and digital infrastructure is designed to proactively support innovation.Perhaps the most significant shift in Dubai’s approach is how it treats creators not as entertainers but as micro-enterprises. The city has seen a notable increase in the issuance of freelance permits to digital content professionals in recent years, reflecting its commitment to fostering the creator economy. This growth underscores Dubai's strategic emphasis on supporting digital entrepreneurs through initiatives like Creator HQ and various free zone offerings.Many of these include Indian-origin creators who have turned their side hustles into registered commercial entities.A Delhi-based travel blogger, Rishabh Jain, who relocated to Dubai in 2023, stated that he started with Instagram Reels. Now, with his shift to Dubai, he has obtained a business license, a team of three editors, and a content agency.The Emirate has also made financing easier. Several banks and fintech platforms have products for this economy—offering influencer-focused credit, revenue-linked payment plans, and financial literacy workshops through Creator HQ.Another significant factor is its collaborative ecosystem; frequent mixers hosted by Dubai Media City bring together influencers, production houses, tech startups, and tourism boards under one roof. These aren’t just networking events— they’re collaborative content hubs that catalyze business connections.In early 2025, a Creator Residency Programme funded by Dubai Department of Economy & Tourism (DET) brought together ten creators from India, Egypt, and the Philippines to co-create a travel mini-series titled “City of Stories,"" which was later syndicated by Emirates Airlines’ in-flight entertainment platform.The Mumbai-based food blogger Neha Vora, who participated in the programme, added that it is the kind of support that is rarely seen.

Why Canadians are turning on Tim Hortons: A brewing identity crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-canadians-are-turning-on-tim-hortons-a-brewing-identity-crisis/articleshow/121408783.cms,"Tim Hortons’ American ownership and loss of Canadian identity

Local ownership vs corporate control



Tim Hortons trying to reclaim national pride





For decades, Tim Hortons has been a cherished symbol of Canadian identity, tied closely to the country's culture and national pride. But in recent months, public sentiment has shifted. Many Canadians are voicing frustration and even outrage over the company’s deepening ties to the United States. What was once considered a beloved national treasure is now being criticized for losing its roots. With its parent company headquartered in Miami and a growing perception of American influence, Tim Hortons is facing a backlash that has some customers calling for a boycott and questioning what it truly means to be Canadian.Tim Hortons was founded in 1964 by hockey player Tim Horton and quickly grew into a staple of everyday Canadian life. However, its 2014 acquisition by Burger King, and the resulting formation of Restaurant Brands International, shifted its corporate structure. The company now has its principal executive offices in Miami, and 60 percent of its shares are held in the US. This shift has left many Canadians feeling the brand no longer represents them, despite its ongoing marketing campaigns claiming it is “proudly Canadian.The criticism has been especially vocal online, with Reddit users and commentators expressing disgust over the chain’s continued dominance in Canadian life. Some are angry that a company with American leadership is still seen as a Canadian cultural icon. One Reddit user called it “embarrassing,” while others have accused Tim Hortons of destroying local food culture and selling out its identity. Despite efforts by the company to address concerns through public relations campaigns, many feel these gestures are hollow.While Tim Hortons argues it remains Canadian through its franchised business model, with profits going to local Canadian owners, critics are unconvinced. They point out that major corporate decisions are made in the US, and that the branding of ""Canadian-ness"" is more a marketing tactic than a reflection of values. Business experts say the situation is nuanced, but the symbolic weight of American control has ignited a strong emotional reaction among Canadians.In February, Tim Hortons launched a campaign reaffirming its Canadian roots, but the move was met with skepticism. The company's press release titled “Is Tim Hortons Canadian?” was widely seen as defensive rather than reassuring. Many Canadians now see Tim Hortons as a brand that has drifted too far from its origins, turning what was once a point of pride into a point of contention. Whether the company can win back public trust remains uncertain in a time when national identity feels more contested than ever.","Tim hortons was founded in 1964 and quickly grew into a staple of everyday canadian life.

Why Japan's Gen Z is 'quiet quitting' work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-japans-gen-z-is-quiet-quitting-work/articleshow/121391191.cms,"Representative Image (AI)

Poll Do you believe that 'quiet quitting' is a positive trend in the workplace? Yes, it's about work-life balance No, it reflects disengagement

The quest for more 'me time'

No longer giving it all for the company

Death by overwork







In a nation that has long been synonymous with working hard and showing unswerving loyalty to an employer, more and more Japanese people are ""quiet quitting"" their jobs.A term originally coined in the United States in 2022 for people who are disengaged and just do the bare minimum of work, ""quiet quitting"" has taken on a slightly different meaning in Japan — and one that would arguably make legions of toiling ""salarymen"" shudder.A growing number of Japanese are choosing to clock in at work exactly on time and leave as soon as they can.They are not looking for praise or promotion from their seniors. They are unbothered by the prospect of better pay if it means more work, while performance-related bonuses also fail to inspire them.According to a study of 3,000 workers aged 20 to 59 conducted by the Mynavi Career Research Lab, a Tokyo-based employment research agency, some 45% say they are doing the bare minimum in their jobs. Significantly, employees in their 20s are most likely to admit to being ""quiet quitters.""There are many reasons why Japanese workers are no longer giving their all for their companies.For 26-year-old Issei, the answer is straightforward: He wants more time to pursue the things he enjoys.""I don't hate my job and I know I have to work to pay my rent and bills, but I would much rather be meeting up with my friends, traveling or listening to live music,"" said Issei, who asked that his family name not be provided.""I know that my grandfather and even my parents' generation thought they had no choice but to work hard and earn more money, but I do not understand that way of thinking,"" he said.""I think it is better to balance work and the things I want to do away from the office and I believe that most of my friends feel that way as well.""The Mynavi study concluded that being able to have more ""me time"" was the primary motivation for most people who admitted to ""quiet quitting.""Others said they believed the amount of work they were putting in was appropriate for the pay they were receiving and that they were ""satisfied"" with their level of input and still gained a sense of accomplishment at work.Others said they were doing the bare minimum to get by because they felt their contribution to the company was not appreciated or they had no interest in promotion or advancing their career.""A lot of young people saw their parents sacrifice their lives to a company, putting in many, many hours of overtime and effectively giving up on their private life,"" said Sumie Kawakami, a social sciences lecturer at Yamanashi Gakuin University and a certified career consultant. ""They have figured out that is not what they want.""""In the past, an employer would pay a fair wage and provide benefits so people stayed with the same company all the way until retirement,"" she told DW.""But that is no longer the case; companies are trying to cut costs, not all staff are on full contracts and pay while bonuses are not as generous as they were,"" she added.""People see that and do not feel obliged to sacrifice themselves for the company,"" she said.Attitudes have also changed as a result of the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted some to question their priorities. A new generation of young adultsstarted ""finding it difficult to accept the concept of lifetime commitment to one company,"" Kawakami said.Izumi Tsuji, a professor of the sociology of culture at Tokyo's Chuo University, said his experiences around young people have led him to the same conclusions.""There is a huge change in the attitudes towards work among young people and my generation of people in their 50s,"" he said.""In the past, workers were extremely loyal to their employers, worked long hours, put in unpaid overtime and did not look to switch companies,"" he said.""In return, they and their families were provided for until they retired.""Today, young people want to ""concentrate on their hobbies, to be freer and to have a better work-life balance,"" he said.Tsuji sees the shift as a welcome change after decades of intense demands placed on workers by corporate Japan.""It has to be a good thing,"" Tsuji said.""People were too loyal to their companies in the past and they had no life outside the office. Now, if they have lots more free time then maybe they will be spending more money and helping the economy or, even more importantly, meeting a partner and having a family. And that is important because the population is shrinking.""Kawakami adds another reason why ""quiet quitting"" marks a shift for the better for millions of Japanese employees.""I welcome this change because older generations of workers would give 150% to their companies but the price they paid was 'karoshi',"" she said, the Japanese term for death brought on by overwork.In 1998, there were 32,863 suicides in Japan, with many linked to brutally long working hours and workplace pressure. The total figure for suicides remained above the 30,000 threshold for the next 14 years, but has been gradually declining since. In 2024, some 20,320 people died by their own hand, the second-lowest figure since 1978, when statistics were first compiled.""Young people no longer feel that they have no choice but to stay in a job where they are not happy or to spend more time on themselves,"" Kawakami said. ""The result is happier people","More and more japanese people are ""quiet quitting"" their jobs. A growing number of japanese are choosing to clock in at work exactly on time and leave as soon as they can. They are unbothered by the prospect of better pay if it means more work, while performance-related bonuses also fail to inspire them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121391475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-819495,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
