Zo Caswell’s rising social media glow

Why their off-field story matters

Romance, relatability, and Cleveland’s hope

Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel and his fiancée, Zo Caswell, took a simple date night and turned it into a headline-worthy moment. With Caswell posting a mirror selfie in a sleek black crop top and Gabriel dressed in casual streetwear, the couple once again showed why they’ve become one of the NFL ’s most-watched young pairs, blurring the line between football spotlight and lifestyle buzz.It wasn’t a touchdown pass that caught attention this time, but an Instagram Story. Caswell, who has quickly grown into a style voice of her own, captured the evening with a minimalist caption—“Date night”—tagging Gabriel as they prepared to step out.Her choice of outfit spoke volumes. The black crop top paired with wide-legged cargo pants and a cozy cardigan offered an effortless blend of chic and casual. Gabriel, keeping it relaxed, countered her glam with an oversized white tee, joggers, and sneakers. Together, they struck a balance between high-fashion confidence and everyday relatability.For Browns fans, the moment highlighted something beyond football. Gabriel, who has been battling to make his mark in Cleveland’s quarterback room, has shown an ability to connect with fans in ways that go far beyond the playbook.“Dillon has this calm energy about him,” one fan wrote in response to the post. “You can see it even in the way he carries himself off the field.”That connection—between personal charm and professional grind—has made him a relatable figure for Cleveland supporters, many of whom see him as the future of the franchise.Caswell’s growing digital footprint is just as fascinating. Her Instagram has become a window into the couple’s journey, mixing style snapshots with moments of intimacy that fans rarely get from NFL circles.The date night selfie was followed by a shot of a martini glass against the glow of candlelight, suggesting the couple had settled into Cleveland’s Marble Room Steaks & Raw Bar for dinner. It’s not just about aesthetics—Caswell has been shaping her own identity, striking a chord with young women who see her as both grounded and aspirational.The NFL has long been driven by on-field narratives, but Gabriel and Caswell are proving that off-field stories carry weight too. Their presence on social media reflects a generational shift where players’ personal lives matter as much as their stats.“Football is important, but fans want to know the person behind the helmet,” a sports lifestyle analyst explained. “When Gabriel and Caswell share these glimpses, it builds loyalty not just for the player, but for the Browns as a brand.”As training camp intensity collides with preseason nerves, Gabriel’s steady partnership with Caswell paints a fuller picture of the young QB. He is not just fighting for reps; he is building a life, carving out stability in a league notorious for its uncertainty.For Cleveland, that combination of professional promise and personal relatability is golden. A quarterback who can win games while also humanizing the Browns’ brand off the field gives fans something rare: a story they can invest in. And for Gabriel and Caswell, sometimes all it takes is a mirror selfie and a two-word caption to remind everyone that love, style, and football can all share the same frame.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","Cleveland browns rookie quarterback dillon gabriel and his fiancée, zo caswell, took a simple date night and turned it into a headline-worthy moment.

How to use Microsoft Copilot AI insights for smarter fantasy football decisions

Fantasy football managers always want an edge to gain an advantage in their drafts. With the 2025 NFL season fast approaching, many are looking to artificial intelligence (AI) for help. Microsoft Copilot AI has been used to find potential sleepers, busts and more for the upcoming season. While AI has great data behind it and can be helpful, we need to keep in mind that AI also has its limitations and should serve as one of many tools - not the only decision-maker.Microsoft Copilot artificial intelligence studied many factors to prepare predictive predictions for the 2025 fantasy football season. When looking at the No. 1 overall pick, the artificial intelligence suggests wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase of the Cincinnati Bengals.Chase had an incredible year in 2024, leading the NFL in receiving touchdowns (17) and receiving yards (1,708), and is an outstanding choice for fantasy management.Regarding sleepers, the artificial intelligence recommends aiming for players who may be underappreciated in drafts.These players have great value and the ability to exceed expectations.For busts, on the other hand, the artificial intelligence flags players who could be overrated or in bad circumstances and counsels managers to tread carefully.While AI does provide valuable data-based analysis, there is much more fantasy managers need to consider. A coaching change, team environment, or injury can all significantly affect player performance.In addition to that, managers need to compare AI projections against current news and opinions of experts because AI models do not reflect always have the most up-to-date information.Microsoft Copilot AI delivers valuable metrics to assist fantasy managers in the 2025 fantasy football season.Nevertheless, fantasy managers should keep in mind that they are just one tool among many to rely on when making fantasy sports decisions and factoring in everything that is relevant to a successful draft.","Microsoft copilot ai predicts top picks sleepers and busts for fantasy football 2025.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is known from his business acumen . Oracle co-founder and world’s second richest man Larry Ellison also appreciates Gates’ business sense. Ellison once offered an interesting tribute to Bill Gates and praised his unmatched business drive, while candidly acknowledging that Gates may not be the smartest person in tech, but he is the most relentless. In a 2011 interview with TellTaleStory, Ellison said, “Bill, forgive me, there are a lot of people in the world smarter than Bill Gates. There are very few people in the world that have his focus and endurance.”Speaking to TellTaleStory, Ellison described Gates as ‘utterly relentless’ and ‘indefatigable’. Ellison added that he completely impressed with his unwavering stamina and ambition. He also went ahead and linked Gates with industrial titan John D. Rockefeller , saying, “If he were Edison, he’d be less dangerous. He is utterly relentless… he wants it all.”The remarks by Oracle founder underscores Gates reputation as a powerhouse. He regarded Gates as someone who may not have been the most brilliant scientist in the room, but he is the one who has the ability to execute and dominate.Bill Gates’ mother Mary Gates played a very important role in securing Microsoft’s landmark deal with IBM in 1980. The agreement helped the company to launch into tech history. Earlier this year, Microsoft celebrated its 50th anniversary.

Why workers protested at Microsoft building

Microsoft has fired two more employees – Nisreen Jardat and Julius Shan for a sit-in protest at President Brad Smith’s office against the software giant’s business ties to Israel. The protest, organised by No Azure for Apartheid demanded Microsoft to terminate its ties with Israel and offer reparations to Palestine. The development comes a day after the company fired two workers – Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle after participating in the protest, taking the total number of employees fired by Microsoft to four. According to a Reuters report, Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli received voicemails informing them that they were fired. Microsoft said the employees were terminated “due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct,” including the sit-in that “created significant safety concerns for our employees.”Members of No Azure for Apartheid shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), informing about the latest termination. In a press conference on August 28, the group said that the firings were an attempt to silence workers’ voices. The activist group said Microsoft misrepresented its protest, further accusing the company of bringing in security and police, which made the situation worse.Redmond police arrested seven people during August 26’s sit-in on charges of trespassing, resisting arrest, and obstruction.Microsoft issued a statement when it fired Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle on August 27. However, there is no update from the company on the latest firing of Nisreen Jardat and Julius Shan.Announcing the termination of the employees, the company then said:“Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct. The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested. These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters.”The group No Azure for Apartheid, named after Microsoft’s Azure software, has called on the company to cut ties with Israel and provide financial aid to Palestinians. A joint media investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call reported that the Azure software is used by an Israeli military surveillance agency. The investigation goes on to claim that the agency utilized Azure to store recordings of phone calls made by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and for the broader surveillance of Palestinians.""We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,"" Hattle said in a statement.",Nisreen jardat and julius shan have been fired for participating in a sit-in protest.

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption. This approach, he argued, aligned with Microsoft's growth-oriented culture that prioritizes continuous learning and adaptation during his time leading GitHub.The stance reflects broader industry shifts toward mandatory AI integration, with companies increasingly viewing artificial intelligence proficiency as essential for competitive advantage rather than optional technological enhancement.","Github ceo thomas dohmke defended microsoft's controversial internal memo.

Apple iPhone 17 series expected processor



Apple iPhone 17 series expected camera

Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The Cupertino-based company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models, namely iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a slim model rumoured to be called iPhone 17 Plus. ahead of the launch, a new leak has appeared online which says that Apple is also planning to bring a new accessory this year. Tipster Majin Bu says that the company may bring Crossbody Strap, designed primarily for iPhone 17 cases.The upcoming Crossbody Strap is said to feature a flexible metal core to make it fully magnetic along its entire length. Rings at the ends will be polarized opposite to the strap, locking the system firmly for a strong grip. This design makes attaching and removing easy without using hooks or loops, offering a practical option for iPhone 17 cases.The leakster adds that the strap could also be compatible with AirPods Pro 3, expanding its range of uses. The report also shares samples of the upcoming strap which shows a woven nylon body, similar to that used in Sport Loop Bands. Apple may introduce a silicone variant as well. The upcoming iPhone accessory is rumoured to be offered in multiple colour options.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature display sizes similar to the current lineup, with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retaining their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The screen size of the standard iPhone 17 may grow to 6.3 inches, matching the Pro model.Early reports hinted that the slimmer iPhone 17 Air might be a premium device priced higher than the Pro Max. However, sources now indicate it will be a mid-range model, cheaper than both the Pro and Pro Max but more expensive than the standard iPhone 17. This positions it as a direct replacement for the “Plus” model, offering a middle ground in size and price.All four iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, a feature that was earlier exclusive to Pro models. This upgrade will be made possible by LTPO OLED panels. While LTPO displays also allow for an always-on screen, it is not yet confirmed if this feature will come to all models or remain Pro-only.For the Pro versions, Apple may replace titanium with aluminum for part of the frame, while keeping glass for MagSafe charging. This could result in a half-glass, half-aluminum build that improves durability. A new horizontal pill-shaped camera bump may replace the current square design, with the iPhone 17 Air also tipped to adopt this layout.Powering the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be Apple’s new A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s latest 3nm process for improved speed and power efficiency. For the first time, iPhones could come with 12GB of RAM, allowing smoother multitasking and enabling advanced Apple Intelligence AI features.All iPhone models set to launch in 2025 are rumored to get a major front camera upgrade, moving from the 12-megapixel lens in the iPhone 16 series to a new 24-megapixel sensor. This improvement is expected to deliver sharper photos and allow users to crop images without losing detail.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is tipped to be the first iPhone with three 48-megapixel rear cameras — a Wide, an Ultra Wide, and a Tetraprism Telephoto lens — and may also support 8K video recording for the first time. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to come with a single 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.The Pro models could introduce a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust how much light enters the camera for better control over depth-of-field — a first for iPhones, which currently use fixed apertures. They might also add dual video recording, letting users film with both the front and rear cameras at the same time, a feature popular with content creators but currently limited to some third-party apps.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue to offer a 5x Telephoto optical zoom, which will remain exclusive to the Pro lineup. The standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will not include Telephoto lenses or 5x zoom capabilities.","Apple iphone 17 series will launch on september 9.

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities. By identifying time sinks, GPT-5 ensures leaders avoid burnout and maximize efficiency. It also helps executives quickly see if their time matches organizational goals.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.In a Fox Business Network interview, Huang said: ""I don't know that it's 'forced to say yes,' but ultimately, it's in the best interest of the world, of our country, for us to be able to sell in China"" .""So whatever it takes to get it approved for us to be able to sell in China is fine with us,"" he added.",N nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

US Budget airline Spirit Airlines announced on Friday that has filed file for bankruptcy again within a year, but will maintain normal operations, ticket sales and flights.Following its initial bankruptcy filing in November, Spirit had completed a debt restructuring agreement with creditors in March, reducing its liabilities by approximately £800 million.""Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,"" said Spirit President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Davis in a statement on Friday, as quoted by Reuters.The Florida-headquartered company indicated that with this new filing, it ""expects to double down on its efforts to"" reorganise its routes, ""rightsize its fleet,"" and seek additional cost-saving measures.Spirit said that ""The Chapter 11 process will provide Spirit the tools, time and flexibility to continue ongoing discussions with all of its lessors, financial creditors and other parties to implement a financial and operational transformation of the Company.""In April, Dave Davis from Sun Country Airlines succeeded Ted Christie as the company's chief executive. Dave Davis, Spirit's president and CEO, said, ""As we move forward, guests can continue to rely on Spirit to provide high-value travel options and connect them with the people and places that matter most.""Still, the company posted a net loss of about $246 million in the three months to end-June. Struggling with a cash crunch, it said last week it had drawn down the full $275 million available under its revolving credit line, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, according to industry analysts and executives, Spirit’s woes trace back to its inability to streamline its inflated cost structure during its first bankruptcy. In the latest quarter, operating expenses reached $1.2 billion—equal to 118 per cent of its revenue.Spirit is also embroiled in a dispute with aircraft lessor AerCap Holdings over a deal for 36 Airbus planes scheduled for delivery in 2027–28. As part of its restructuring plan, the airline said it will scale back operations in select markets and shrink its fleet to meaningfully cut debt and lease liabilities—moves it expects will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings.The low-cost carrier expanded its capacity and market presence following the Covid pandemic but encountered heightened competition from rival airlines.In 2022, competitor Frontier Airlines proposed a £2.9 billion merger with Spirit. Subsequently, JetBlue presented a potentially more valuable offer, but regulatory authorities' antitrust concerns prevented the deal's completion.","Spirit airlines to file for bankruptcy again within a year.

His secret to cracking big tech interviews

Advice for aspiring AI engineers





At just 23, Manoj Tumu has cracked the code many engineers spend years chasing - a $400,000 (Rs 3.36 crore) paycheck and a role at Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta.The Indian-American software engineer swapped Amazon for the social media giant earlier this year, joining its advertising research team, and now he’s sharing the playbook behind his rapid rise.Tumu admits Amazon gave him a solid foundation, but the lure of Meta’s projects was irresistible. “Though I had learned a lot at Amazon, I just thought there was more interesting work going on at Meta,” he told Business Insider. When the offer landed in June, he didn’t hesitate.Tumu says the timing was perfect. Machine learning has transformed in recent years, shifting from human-driven “classical” techniques to deep learning, where neural networks crunch raw data automatically. “That change has opened up exciting opportunities,” he explained.If you thought referrals or flashy projects were the ticket in, Tumu disagrees. He revealed he got into both Amazon and Meta without a reference - just a “decent resume” and a lot of persistence. His advice? Ditch the college project section once you’ve gained two or three years of experience and focus on professional impact instead.And when it comes to interviews, he insists the behavioral round is where many stumble.“At Amazon, I went through six rounds of interviews. I studied the company’s values, wrote a huge document of stories and follow-ups, and tailored my answers for every principle,” he said. His takeaway: knowing the company’s culture is as important as knowing your code.For students, his golden rule is simple - grab an internship, no matter the pay. “Even low-paying internships can be beneficial. Experience matters more than money early on,” he said.Tumu, who started his master’s program in 2022, also swears by cold emails. Sending them helped him get his foot in the door — something he says aspiring AI professionals shouldn’t shy away from.",Manoj tumu left amazon for mark zuckerberg's meta earlier this year.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.
