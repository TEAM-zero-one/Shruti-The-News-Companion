The numbers that matter

Annual production target from Lucknow unit: 80–100 missiles.

Expected revenue contribution by FY 2027-28: Rs 3,000 crore

GST from a single missile: Rs 8 crore. On October 18, DG BrahMos, Jaytirth R Joshi handed over the GST bill and cheque of around Rs 40 crore to the UP chief minister, symbolising revenue generation for the state.

Export pipeline: Negotiations ongoing with around dozen countries

Indigenous content in current production block: 83%, moving to 85% in 2026, which includes fully indigenous titanium castings (PTC Industries, Lucknow), solid rocket boosters, airframe (L&T, Godrej), avionics (HAL & Data Patterns), and inputs from 200+ Indian MSMEs.





The next frontier

Lucknow has witnessed many histories. Whispers of nawabs and poets, of rebellion and resilience, have seeped into its very essence. The Ganges, not far away, flowing steadily southward, is bearing witness to the birth of something unstoppable—a supersonic force that is redefining the skies, seas, and soils of a nation on the cusp of global reckoning. This is not a factory; it is a crucible. Sprawling over 200-acre canvas on the city’s outskirts, the state-of-the-art BrahMos Aerospace Integration and Testing Facility , India’s most formidable conventional deterrent—the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile—is being born, assembled, and given its wings.The journey began in 2018 when the Uttar Pradesh government offered 200 acres of prime land along the Lucknow-Kanpur highway as part of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC). BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), the Indo-Russian joint venture between DRDO and Russia’s NPO Mashinostroyeniya, had outgrown its Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram, Pilani and Nagpur’s production and system integration units. Orders were pouring in: the Indian navy wanted more ship- and submarine-launched missiles, the air force was integrating the air-launched version on forty Su-30MKIs, the army needed extended-range land variants, and — most importantly — export enquiries were turning into hard contracts.The Philippines had already taken delivery of its first battery in 2024 under a 375 million USD deal. Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Argentina, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were in various stages of negotiation. By 2025 BrahMos Aerospace had firm orders for over 800 missiles in the next five years. Existing facilities simply could not cope.So, Lucknow happened.Built at a cost of around Rs 380 crore, the new campus is a city within a city: massive integration halls, a booster production block, a warhead mating facility, long high-speed sled track for subsystem validation, and an environmentally controlled pre-dispatch inspection bay that looks more like a spacecraft cleanroom than a weapons factory.Every variant of the BrahMos family — from the original 290 km land and ship versions to the 600 km extended-range and the lighter BrahMos-NG under development — will roll out from here.This year on May 11, defence minister Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated the facility, the crown jewel of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor (UPDIC), was conceived with a singular, powerful objective: to become the epicentre for meeting the soaring domestic and international demand for the BrahMos weapon system.“The state-of-the-art BrahMos Integration and Testing facility in Lucknow has been set up to cater to the growing demand for BrahMos weapon systems in the domestic and international markets. Its strategic location, a logistical advantage with seamless access to national freight corridors, ensures that the fury assembled here can be dispatched with efficiency to any frontier,” said an official source.On October 18, the defence minister in presence of chief minister Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath , department of defence R&D and chairman DRDO Samir V Kamat, and DG BrahMos Jaytirth R Joshi, flagged off the first batch of missiles to the Indian Armed Forces, sleek and lethal in their transporter canisters, it marked a paradigm shift. For decades, defence manufacturing was perceived as the preserve of coastal or traditional industrial hubs. Lucknow’s roar announced a new geography of power.Built at an estimated cost of Rs 380 crore, the campus is described as a “city within a city,” designed for end-to-end integration and quality validation. Key components mentioned include:The aim: produce and support multiple BrahMos variants—from legacy 290 km versions to extended-range and the under-development BrahMos-NG.BrahMos Aerospace employs around 300-500 people directly at the Lucknow unit today, but the ripple effect is staggering.A senior BrahMos official explained: “A missile is an extremely complex system that draws on diverse industries, advanced materials, chemicals, rubber, electronics, mechanical subsystems, precision machining, welding, and more. Today, BrahMos works with over 200 private and public-sector industry partners across India who supply components, sub-assemblies, off-the-shelf items, and specialised fixtures to build the complete weapon system. """"With demand rising sharply, both from the Indian armed forces and export orders, we need to significantly diversify and expand our supply chain. The new Lucknow facility, located at the heart of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor, offers the ideal platform to onboard many more MSMEs and manufacturers in the region. Proximity will enable tighter project monitoring, faster iteration, and even higher quality standards,"" added the officialThe official added that the company is actively scouting new vendors in and around Lucknow to support production targetsFurther, the human capital powering this enterprise is as meticulously curated as the technology. BrahMos Aerospace, as a world-class defence entity, adheres to a creed of pure meritocracy.“We recruit highly skilled professionals involved in designing a very high-end weapon system. We adhere to the same standards for Lucknow,” stated the official source. There is no quota for locality; excellence is the only passport.For a young engineer dreaming of contributing to missile technology, the path is clear and demanding.A stellar academic foundation in aerospace, mechanical, electronics, or computer science is the entry ticket. The recruitment funnel—through national vacancies and elite campus placements—involves rigorous technical assessments, multiple interview rounds, and stringent security clearances. The promise of “huge employment opportunities” is real, but they are opportunities earned in the most competitive arena.At present, the Lucknow facility will roll out the existing BrahMos missile to meet increased demand, but its specific purpose is to manufacture the BrahMos NG missile—NG stands for next generation. The BrahMos NG will have a 300 km range, equal to the current missile, but will be significantly lighter, at 1.2 tonnes (1,200 kilograms) compared to the existing model’s 2,900 kilograms.The new BrahMos NG would be integrated on Sukhoi 30. Currently, the Su 30 can integrate only one missile, but with the NG version, five missiles can be integrated: four on Light Combat Aircraft. On land and ship versions, instead of three missiles, six or eight can be packed, thanks to the reduced size. This approach aims to maintain effectiveness while increasing numbers and reducing costs, ensuring steady supply to the armed forces. The Lucknow facility will be its birthplace.An official source summed it up: “The BrahMos Integration and Testing Facility is an ultra-modern manufacturing unit designed for the production, assembly, and integration of all BrahMos variants, including the advanced air-launched version. It will also serve as the hub for the next-generation BrahMos in the foreseeable future.”","Brahmos aerospace private limited (bapl), the indo-russian joint venture between drdo and russia’s npo mashinostroyeniya, had outgrown its hyderabad, thiruvananthapuram, pilani and nagpur's production and system integration units. By 2025 brahmos aerospace had firm orders for over 800 missiles in the next five years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126115089,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couples wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secrets.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative. He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay.Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships. Although he was never as high on the control totem pole as his old man, his standing in the company meant he was around some significant cash decisions in WWE's most successful years.Shane McMahon has built up a portfolio of separate business interests away from WWE, with a particular focus on technology, media, and emerging industries. He has been chairman and advisor to a number of companies, as part of the indication that he might be looking to diversify beyond wrestling-related income. They have not always been runaway headline-grabbers, but all together they build up his overall financial footprint and his long game for the long haul.Less dramatic is the financial story of Marissa Mazzola-McMahon. She comes from a film production and corporate public relations background, and her career has been built on cash flows, not large equity windfalls. Her own net worth is frequently thought to be about $5 million. Add in Shane's holdings, and their financial empire still has deep roots in WWE legacy wealth, supported, but increasingly crucial, by business diversification.Also Read: Shane McMahon adds fuel to rumors of Vince McMahon reclaiming WWE ownership","Shane mcmahon and marissa mazzola-mcmahon, who both served as wwe producer/director, are worth a combined $650 million.

How Brooklyn Beckham has built his personal fortune

Nicola Peltz’s Hollywood career and billionaire family backing

Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have become one of the hottest pairs of young celebrity couples in the planet, thanks to both their famous surnames and the rarefied (and distinct) financial universes they inhabit. Bringing together British sports and fashion royalty with an American dynasty of Hollywood and high finance, their marriage endowed a joint fortune that captivated public imagination among their fans.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025. While these fortunes sit next door to much larger family fortunes that continue to define their lifestyle, opportunities, and financial safety, this figure represents their earnings from creative careers that brought them to our attention in the first place.Anybody with a last name Beckham could show up and just straight-up stomp the rest of them, but Brooklyn Beckham, son of famous footballer David Beckham and fashion designer Victoria Beckham, has been working hard to build up a career apart from the famous family. Most of his income has been through modeling campaigns, commercial photography assignments, and sponsored collaborations related to fashion, food, and lifestyle brands.Although his publishing and culinary projects have elicited a more erratic response from critics, brand tie-ins and social media collaborations have been a veritable financial goldmine. We estimate Brooklyn Beckham to have a dominantly stagnant commercial but blockbuster, sparse personal net worth of $10 million by 2025.Nicola Peltz brings a different financial profile to the marriage. She also has a long history of acting in television productions and major film franchises, as well as modeling and other appearances in the fashion industry for more income. All of these put together have allowed her to acquire an estimated personal net worth of around 50 million dollars.In addition to her personal income, Nicola Peltz has the granddaddy of all sources of wealth, as she is the daughter of hedge fund mogul Nelson Peltz. While this family fortune is not technically included in her individual wealth, it bestows one access to large amounts of money, such as through luxury real estate, private investments, and elite business circles.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz are the perfect modern union between a famous couple whose individual monetary pursuits are inexplicably tied to familial connections. A combined $60 million net worth certainly reflects what each of them has, but the rest of their family lines seem to continue giving them public exposure and wifely earnings power. Their account of ever-growing riches in 2025 has less to do with consolidation than it does with the merging of celebrity, family, and meticulously crafted careers.Also Read: Beckham family rift deepens: Brooklyn unfollows parents David and Victoria, spends Christmas apart","Brooklyn beckham and nicola peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025.

While Pauline never directly named the accused during her livestream, many viewers believed she was referring to fellow creator Tylil James.In a lengthy post on X, Pauline cited relentless cyberbullying and emotional exhaustion as the reasons for stepping away.

Sophie Cunningham’s future outlook



Sophie Cunningham has never shied away from calling out WNBA’s pay structure. Despite experiencing the most explosive era of its existence, the WNBA’s financial reality for many of its veterans remains a point of sharp contention. As the league celebrates record-breaking viewership and skyrocketing ticket sales, the disconnect between cultural impact and player compensation has reached a boiling point.Amidst high-stakes Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations, players are increasingly vocal about the league not paying them enough, and that is very well seen when comparing NBA’s highest $59.6 million for 2025-26 with WNBA’s highesthest $249 thousand for 2025. Cunningham, during her recent appearance on “Sundae Conversations,” sparked a viral conversation about the league's pay scale while hinting at a ""Plan B"" option to secure her future beyond the hardwood.In the Sundae Conversations episode released on December 21, Caleb Pressley interviewed Sophie Cunningham, and the latter didn't hold back when discussing the league contract structure.When asked, “You do get paid?” Cunningham replied, “You know, barely.But we’re still surviving.” She gave a hearty laugh when asked if there’s a “Plan B” if WNBA sc**ws over and clarified it is “Not plan B but project B.” Project B is a new global basketball league that will commence in 2026. According to co-founder Grady Burnett, Project B represents “the best basketball in the world.”The interview turned in an interesting direction when the host, Caleb, asked, “Do you think you even need the league or could you just make money on only fans?” Cunningham, emphasizing the leagues’ existence, replied, “No, I think you do need the leagues because that’s what gives you the platform to have all these fans.” She also added, “Maybe plan B should support that (only fans) platform.The shift toward ""Project B"" highlights a growing trend of WNBA athletes seeking equity and massive cash infusions that the traditional league structure currently lacks. For 2025, the average WNBA salary is around $102,000. This forces the players to turn towards entrepreneurial options. For someone with the brand power of Sophie Cunningham, who was the only WNBA star on Google’s trend list for 2025, this means looking at every available avenue. Platforms like OnlyFans, which several athletes have used to exert total control over their likeness and revenue, remain a potential option.For the 2026 season, the new CBA rules might push the average salary over $500K but these alternative ventures aren't just about extra cash, but a step toward securing a future beyond the underwhelming cheques.Also read: Sophie Cunningham spills beans on Caitlin Clark snubbing “Project B” invite, raising questions about WNBA","Sophie cunningham has never shied away from calling out wnba’s pay structure.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

NEW DELHI: Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of GRAP-4 and over 2 lakh have been issued Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates.He added that govt is also upgrading all PUC centres with high-capacity equipment to reduce delays and ensure accurate emission testing.Additionally, a third-party inspection mechanism will be introduced to strengthen credibility and transparency in certification.He said the 2 lakh vehicles got the PUC tests done after the ""No PUC, No Fuel"" rule came into effect. Nearly 10,000 vehicles that were tested failed to meet the standards. ""This clearly indicates that the enforcement measures are being implemented seriously and are yielding results,"" Sirsa added.According to experts, the current on-road vehicle inspection programme is weak and based on simple idle testing of CO and hydrocarbons (HC) at two speed idle tests, along with Lambda test for petrol vehicles and smoke density test for diesel vehicles.Researchers at DTU had earlier rolled out an AQI-type PUC certificate system that considered the mileage of vehicles too when testing for emissions.They referred to older studies published with the Atmospheric Pollution Research and American Society of Civil Engineers (ACSE), and suggested inspections and maintenance, along with mileage, as important factors that should be incorporated in PUC tests.Dr Rajeev Kumar Mishra, associate professor at the department of environmental science and engineering at DTU, said the testing now and recertification for in-use cars should include fast idle conditions as well as mass emission testing. The PUC certificate is given just based on the CO and hydrocarbon emissions when the car is in the idle state, meaning the engine is not revving, he said. Emissions such as NO2, PM2.5 and VOC at the fast idling stage at 2500 rpm are sometimes recorded, but these are not considered during certification, he pointed out.""Identifying which vehicles should be phased out or issued PUC certificates should be based on the accumulated mileage, maintenance records, and performance according to both emission norms, not just by age,"" Mishra said. There are no standards from BS-6, and every vehicle is tested based on its built type, he added.According to a study by CSE, vehicle emissions are one of Delhi's major source of air pollution and have a direct impact on human health. While PUC checks may keep the highly polluting vehicles off the road, it still doesn't address the harmful emissions such as PM2.5 and other toxic gases.""Various studies on source apportionment and emission inventory have shown that vehicles are the second largest contributor of particulate emissions. Vehicles are responsible for highly toxic exposures as the emissions happen at the breathing height,"" said Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager on air pollution at the Centre for Science and Environment. She suggested more updated vehicle emission surveillance systems, such as remote sensing mechanisms.She pointed to another layer of problems in PUC certification — the centres themselves. ""CSE and EPCA conducted an audit in 2017 of PUC system in Delhi-NCR. They found that at many places, certificates were issued without putting the probe into the tailpipe. In NCR, there were centres that had only printers, not even a monitor. There were instances when different centres showed varying results. PUC staff should have a compulsory ITI certificate but that was not the case,"" she said.","Environment minister manjinder singh sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of grap-4.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen huang, ceo of $4.4 trillion ai chip giant nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates has now acknowledged that he was ‘very wrong’ in assuming that making information widely available would naturally lead people to seek out accurate facts. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Gates said that the had been quite naive to believe that access to information alone would curb misinformation. But now he sees that as a growing problem which is being passed on the younger generation. Gates admitted that he underestimated the appeal of confirmation bias, the tendency for people to gravitate toward platforms and connect which reinforce their present views. ““When we made information available, I thought people would want correct information,” Gates said. “But even I wallow. If there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s an article criticizing him—even if exaggerated—I enjoy reading it.”Gates perspective further shifted after heading his daughter Phoebe Gates description. Phoebe described how she was harassed online underscoring the personal toll of misinformation and online abuse. Phoebe who is also the co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia, has previously spoken about being “memed” for her interracial relationship, highlighting how misinformation and online ridicule can distort public perception.Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes. He emphasised that AI systems might be used to enforce rules and regulations around harmful content such as incitement to violence or vaccine misinformation available online.“We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules. And if you have rules, is it some AI that encodes those rules?” Gates asked.Gates also acknowledged that the fight against misinformation will be cyclical, with new detection methods constantly challenged by countermeasures. In a 2023 blog post, Gates wrote: “It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”Microsoft founder Bill Gates' daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia. The new funding values the company at $180 million. However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture.

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of ai startup valuations is unsustainable.
