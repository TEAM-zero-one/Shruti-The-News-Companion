How reality finally caught up with MTV,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-reality-finally-caught-up-with-mtv/articleshow/124593223.cms,".

In India, the M(usic) had gone out of MTV long ago. Now, the channel is shuttering its music channels in Europe. But its VJs, who had made TV cool, have banded together and are now making everyday life look cool, one reel at a time

Political revolutions happen on the streets, often marked by violence and chaos. Cultural revolutions are quieter, even surreptitious. MTV is the perfect example. The music channel was among the biggest cultural ‘influencers’ of the modern world much before Gen Z appropriated the word. And many of us didn’t even notice it.Born in Aug 1981, MTV fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music. The first music video televised on the channel, “Video Killed The Radio Star” by The Buggles, was a cheeky declaration of intent.Till then, songs were auditory. Now, they morphed into the audio-visual. This was also the time when rhythm-driven disco had taken hold of the club and party scene in the West. A hot-stepping John Travolta, with the help of the Bee Gees, had seduced the only-toowilling in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Grease (1978). MTV was perfectly poised to cash in on the perfect storm of opportunity. But the channel was struggling to find a larger, more diverse demographic.Enter Michael Jackson ’s Thriller. The album released in 1982 had recorded good sales, but it was nowhere close to becoming a monster success. But the music videos of its songs — Billie Jean, Beat It and, more specifically, title track Thriller (released in 1983) — took record sales to ginormous levels. Jackson and MTV synergised each other like nothing before or after. “Thriller sealed MTV’s reputation as a new cultural force…” Phile Hebblethwaite wrote in The Guardian in 2013. Equally importantly, it also widened the channel’s demographic reach and advertising appeal, making it a major success.Overall, MTV created the template of the singing-dancing star, shifted public tastes towards a more rhythm-oriented music and eye candy pop stars (think Duran Duran) and became the go-to channel for the 13 plus23 minus defining their idea of cool. Which translated into what outfit to wear and which condoms to use, spawning a parallel multi-billion-dollar consumer industry. MTV was also Money TV.By 1987, MTV even tailored news the way the young allegedly wanted it. A 2023 NYT article recalled how President Bill Clinton’s response to a town hall query put ‘MTV News’ under the spotlight in 1994. The existential question was: “‘Boxers or briefs?’ ‘Usually briefs’, Mr Clinton responded to a room full of giggles.” MTV had seamlessly constructed pop politics.MTV had impacted India long before the channel came to India. In the 1980s, India was a single-television channel country even though the country briefly sampled the new world of music videos, courtesy DD every week. But this was also the video cassette recorder age, when pirated tapes of foreign films and music videos were readily available countrywide. If you saw shades of Jackson’s moonwalk in a Mithun or Govinda move, you didn’t need to think twice how the song found its way to Bollywood. Thousands even in small-town India were already doing the same.In 1991, India opened its economy and the skies. Satellite TV brought in soaps such as ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ bringing the forbidden to upwardly mobile middle-class homes. The urban young found a channel that spoke to — not at them — when MTV India happened in 1996, two years after Channel V, another channel of the same variety. The channels gave them vitality and identity. As in the West, the video jockeys were as pivotal as the music. The VJs — their relaxed flounce, their cool couture, their zany humour — seemed hipper than the Bollywood stars in the newly globalised universe. These channels seldom commanded high TRPs but they ranked high as influencers of the “with-it” as well as the “wannabe” urban young.Both Channel V and MTV eventually went desi, hoping to reach out to a larger audience, enabling the rise of local music talent in Indi-Pop (Silk Route, Alisha Chinoy, Lucky Ali, to name a few) and Bhangra pop (Daler Mehndi). But the times and the tech were a-changin’. Rampant online and offline music piracy caused the fall of record companies, forcing others associated with music to change tracks. Now lifestyle took frontstage.MTV recast itself with reality shows: the intense Roadies (2003) and the dating show, Splitsvilla (2008), to name two. Rannvijay Singha and Ayushsmann Khurana were two early winners of the show. And while these shows continue to enthuse a small section among the young and the restless, MTV ceased to inhabit the young’s cultural cosmos. As smartphones became an extension of the hand, the world got busy broadcasting itself; everyone making their own reels, short videos and video logs. In the new chaotically democratised world of entertainment, there was no space for an arbiter of hip. It was more than just a mid-life crisis. MTV was a great idea whose time had gone.","Mtv fundamentally changed the way the global young consumed popular music. In india, the m(usic) had gone out of mtv long ago.

Can India turn AI threat into its next IT boom?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-india-turn-ai-threat-into-its-next-it-boom/articleshow/124593174.cms,".

By invitation

The fear of machines taking away jobs is all too familiar. It first created panic when the Industrial Revolution hit. Then came the digital age. But the rapid evolution of AI poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not seen before.

That’s why India must revamp how it educates and upskills its youth to catch up

.

For more than two hundred years, each wave of new technology and innovation has carried with it a familiar fear that machines would take away people’s livelihoods. During the Industrial Revolution, the mechanisation of textiles and manufacturing triggered fears of “technological unemployment.” This panic even gave rise to the famous Luddite movement in England, where textile workers destroyed looms they thought would make their jobs obsolete. In reality, while machines did replace some manual weavers, industrialisation also generated vast new opportunities in factories, coal mining, engineering, and other emerging sectors.After World War II, automation and computers revived fears of a “jobless future”. Clerical roles like typists vanished, but new opportunities in software, electronics, and IT created even more jobs. The 1990s internet boom again disrupted work, with automation and outsourcing displacing factory and call-centre jobs.Yet, fresh industries emerged in e-commerce, app development, digital marketing, and cybersecurity.However, this time around the concern seems different and justifiable. The rapid evolution of AI and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before. A McKinsey report estimates that by 2030, automation could replace up to 30% of hours worked in the US, forcing 12 million workers to shift roles. The ILO (International Labour Organization) warns the impact could be even more severe in India, with nearly 70% of existing jobs at high risk from AI and automation.Unlike earlier waves of innovation, even cognitive roles like coding, medical diagnosis, creative content, recruitment, customer support are all increasingly automatable. Now, with robotics and AI, even non-routine manual tasks such as warehouse picking, surgery assistance, and food preparation face the risk of being automated.But the situation is not really as grim as it may sound. If history is any guide, while many occupations will require people to work alongside technology, AI and robotics are likely to add net jobs. American economist David Autor has for long argued that tech and innovation have led to productivity growth, directly augmenting employment. Productivity growth in one sector generates large positive spillovers to employment growth elsewhere in the economy.For a developing economy like India, whether technology and innovation in AI, robotics, and automation lead to a net gain in jobs will largely depend on two key factors. One, how well we equip our students and the workforce through skilling and upskilling and make them job ready; and two, how strongly we invest in research and development.India’s biggest challenge today is that our skills and institutions have not kept pace with rapid shifts in technology. Each year, over 10 million students graduate from colleges and universities, yet the job market struggles to absorb them. A recent report by Mercer Mettl puts the employability of graduates in India at 42.6%. Multiple studies find that 85% of Indian engineering graduates are not job-ready. Our school education relies on rote learning with little focus on practical skills and critical thinking. Higher education is theory heavy.First, we must revamp our skilling programmes with a forward-looking lens, aligned to jobs of the future. Many semi-skilled roles will sustain and grow, be it in frontline sales, relationship managers or after-sales support in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), retail, and telecom, due to our cultural preference for trust and personal interaction. These can absorb large sections of young, educated workers.Similarly, delivery and logistics roles in quick commerce will expand, offering opportunities for lows-killed workers where machines cannot easily replace humans. With India’s tourism and hospitality sector set to grow, demand will rise for frontline staff, travel consultants, chefs, guides, and wildlife experts — creating strong need for skilled and semi-skilled workers.At the same time, AI and automation will reshape employment. In finance, routine processes like loan approvals will be automated, creating demand for specialists in AI training, analytics, and cyber-risk. In manufacturing, repetitive assembly jobs will decline, while technical roles in robotics supervision, maintenance, and monitoring will rise. New roles are expected to emerge in data and artificial intelligence, engineering, cloud computing and product development that will need highly skilled workers, and we need to prepare.The govt must strengthen apprenticeship programmes to meet the needs of a changing economy. So far, India’s apprenticeship model has struggled to bridge academia and industry, with training focused largely on traditional trades like fitter and welder when focus should be on courses in AI, automation, renewable energy, tourism and so on. Even short-term courses (3-6 months) in using computers, soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills can cater to demand in retail, BFSI, and telecom sectors. The revamped hub-and-spoke ITI model announced in the 2024-25 budget under the National Scheme for ITI Upgradation could fill this gap by upgrading curricula and training with industry participation. Its success, however, will depend on effective execution, as past ITI reform efforts at both central and state levels have delivered limited impact.Secondly, India needs to put emphasis on research and development. The future of jobs will be shaped not just by who can use technology, but by who can create and lead it. The US, China, South Korea, and Germany succeeded in their engineering revolutions through large-scale investments in research and innovation, that formed the backbone of job creation in manufacturing, software, electronics, and semiconductors. India still lags behind — while China received 798,337 patent grants in 2023, the US 323,410, Japan 201,420, and South Korea 135,180, India managed 30,490. We are catching up, but we need to do more to shape the future of work.The govt’s launch of the Research and Development Innovation Fund (RDIF) and the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is a right step forward. It provides both a roadmap and corpus to boost research and innovation in the private sector and academia. But much more can be done to create a strong ecosystem for corporate R&D in India.Several ministries already operate with R&D budgets — the ministry of science & technology was allocated a budget of Rs 16,628 crore in FY25 — yet these are often scattered. State govts too can create regional R&D incentives, sector-specific funds and work with local industries and universities. ANRF should quickly work on mapping, monitoring, and aligning all ministry and state-level R&D budgets with streamlined priorities. The foundation can also pool resources from multiple ministries into cross-sectoral missions such as green energy, AI in healthcare and advanced manufacturing instead of isolated projects.Technology and innovation can certainly lead to net addition of jobs in India. But the outcome largely depends on how we manage the transition .The author is chairperson, Quess Corp","The rapid evolution of ai and automation poses the possibility of job losses on a scale and form not experienced before.

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on tuesday, with shares opening at rs 399 on the bombay stock exchange.

Jason Kelce shuts down fake quotes about Bad Bunny but makes a factual error

Fans react to Jason Kelce’s “honest mistake” and defend his intentions





Jason Kelce, one of the NFL ’s most beloved figures, recently found himself in an unexpected online storm after addressing a series of fake quotes falsely attributed to him. While his intention was to set the record straight, fans quickly noticed that his clarification included an embarrassing slip, one that sparked a new wave of reactions on social media.The controversy began when a fabricated quote started circulating online, claiming Kelce had commented on Bad Bunny’s upcoming 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. The viral fake quote read: “If Bad Bunny is a bad fit for the Super Bowl, then maybe the people making these comments are a bad fit for America’s future.”Kelce swiftly took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify, writing, “I normally don’t comment on things like this, but I feel I need to address that there are several accounts posting fake quotes and attributing them to me on this platform right now.”He went on to thank the social platform’s community feature for helping identify misinformation: “I appreciate @X putting community notes on several, and I will not address the other accounts specifically, because I do not want to amplify their engagement. But please know, unless you hear something directly from me via one of my platforms, it is not real.”However, sharp-eyed users were quick to correct Kelce, noting that community notes are not issued by X itself but rather by users who volunteer to fact-check content.Fans pointed out the irony of Kelce unintentionally spreading misinformation while calling it out, turning the clarification into an even bigger talking point.Despite the blunder, fans rallied around the retired Eagles legend. “At least he’s trying to fight fake news — can’t say that about many athletes,” one fan commented. Another joked, “Jason just community-noted himself, and I kinda love that energy.”Others saw humor in the situation, posting memes about how quickly misinformation spreads, even among those trying to stop it. Still, most agreed Kelce’s response reflected his integrity and transparency.As one fan summed it up: “Jason may have misspoken, but at least he’s showing accountability. That’s more than most public figures do.”Also Read: “Any referee that you see on Sunday is..."": Cam Newton’s no-nonsense take on fixing bad officiating could change how the NFL runs games forever With Kelce now working as an ESPN analyst, this episode reminds fans that even the most respected voices in sports can find themselves tangled in the messy web of online misinformation.","Nfl star jason kelce inadvertently sparked a new online buzz after correcting fake quotes attributed to him.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Sony PlayStation Network experienced a temporary outage earlier today, affecting thousands of users across the United States. Reports on DownDetector, a platform that tracks online service disruptions, indicated that over 11,000 users faced issues, primarily related to server connectivity. Users in the United States received ‘service busy’ message while accessing the platform. Problems were also detected with logging in and in carrying out PNS-related social media activities.Now, according to PlayStation Network Service Status, all services have now been restored. “All services are up and running,” the status page reads, including account management, gaming and social and PlayStation Store.As of now, there is no official statement from Sony about what caused the outage.The outage, which lasted for roughly an hour, impacted users in major cities including New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Tampa. Many players reported problems logging in and using PlayStation Network’s social features during the downtime.Expressing frustration, one user wrote in the comment section of Downdetector: “Is it even worth it? Is it even worth it to wake up, eat, go to work, eat, sleep, repeat, for the rest of our lives? There's gotta be more to life than this. Surely we aren't supposed to be here to work to make other people rich”.Sony has since restored the network, and users can now access their accounts, play games, and use online services as normal.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined.

Real-world application matters more than technological supremacy







Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US-China artificial intelligence competition, arguing that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. ""When it comes to AI, there's no such thing as winning the race. It's a long marathon,"" Tsai said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, with recordings posted Wednesday. He emphasised that the AI race isn't about who builds the biggest or most powerful model — it's about who can deploy AI faster.Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models. He argued that ""every week there's a model that's leading, but then the next week another model overtakes them,"" making model superiority a fleeting achievement.The contrasting strategies between the two nations highlight fundamental differences in AI development philosophy. US tech companies have been spending billions, with Meta expecting to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure through 2028, while OpenAI and Oracle announced plans for a $500 billion data center project.Meanwhile, China's AI play focuses on lean, efficient models — cheaper, lighter, and easier to deploy. DeepSeek's R1 model, which disrupted the AI industry and US stock market earlier this year, rivals top competitors but was built at a fraction of the cost.Tsai highlighted China as an example of faster adoption, noting companies are embracing open-source and smaller models optimised for real-world use on mobile devices and laptops.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar concerns about America's adoption pace. Huang said China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology,"" with the country aiming for 70% AI adoption by 2027.""I'm not saying China technologically is winning in the model war, but in terms of the actual application and also people benefiting from AI, it has made a lot of development,"" Tsai stated.Instead of trying to outbuild leading players like OpenAI, China focuses on rolling out AI across everyday tech at breakneck speed, which could prove just as crucial as model quality in determining overall AI competitiveness.","China's lean approach versus america's massive spending strategy highlights fundamental differences in ai development philosophy.

The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy, particularly in technology, healthcare, and academia, helping to fill key skill gaps and drive innovation. Recently, the Trump administration has signalled sweeping reforms beyond the previously proposed $100,000 mandatory fee, which has raised significant concerns among current H-1B holders, prospective applicants, and industry stakeholders. According to a note from the US Department of Homeland Security titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program,” the administration is considering multiple changes, including revising eligibility for cap exemptions, increasing oversight of employers with prior violations, and tightening regulation of third-party job placements, as widely reported. These proposals are expected to be formally published in December this year, potentially reshaping application processes, affecting international talent mobility, and impacting US competitiveness in the global workforce landscape.Weeks before the proposed rule changes, President Donald Trump announced that employers would be required to pay a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This declaration caused immediate panic among the Indian diaspora and other foreign workers on H-1B visas.Many visa holders and their families, who were temporarily outside the US for work or travel, scrambled to return within 24 hours to avoid being stranded or denied entry. The situation eased slightly when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the fee would be a one-time charge applicable only to new petitions and not an annual cost. Despite this clarification, the proposed restrictions continue to generate concern among employers and employees alike, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on foreign talent.H-1B visa holders are not limited to tech roles; roughly a third work in essential sectors such as healthcare, education, religious services, and academia, as highlighted in a recent lawsuit challenging the reforms. Tech companies, in particular, fear that the reforms could disrupt hiring practices, limit access to high-skilled talent, and make the US less competitive on a global scale.Several prominent tech leaders began their US careers under the H-1B visa system, demonstrating its crucial role in fostering innovation and economic growth.Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, India, moved to the US in the early 1990s. He secured an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft, where he rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2014. Nadella has consistently highlighted the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, emphasizing that many of Microsoft's most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through the H-1B program.Sundar Pichai, originally from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, moved to the US for higher studies. After completing his education, he transitioned to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai has emphasized that immigration has been instrumental in America's technological leadership and Google's success, and he has publicly advocated for policies that expand opportunities for skilled immigrants.Aravind Srinivas, born in Chennai, India, moved to the US for higher education and later transitioned to an H-1B visa. He is the founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, a company specializing in generative AI. Despite challenges posed by immigration policies, Srinivas underscores that the US remains a meritocratic environment where talent and innovation are recognized. He emphasizes that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the increase in H-1B visa fees but finding trustworthy mentors and investors.Jayshree Ullal, originally from London and New Delhi, moved to the US at 16 to pursue higher education. She began her career on an H-1B visa and rose through several top tech companies to become CEO of Arista Networks. Ullal has been a vocal advocate for the H-1B visa program, emphasizing its importance in attracting global talent to the US She has also highlighted the challenges of the US immigration process, noting the long wait times for permanent residence approvals.Arvind Krishna, hailing from Dehradun, India, moved to the US in the 1990s on an H-1B visa. He steadily advanced to become CEO of IBM. Krishna has consistently advocated for the US to remain an international talent hub, stressing that global collaboration and access to foreign talent are essential for innovation and economic competitiveness.The H-1B visa programme has historically enabled the United States to attract some of the world’s brightest minds, driving innovation and economic expansion across multiple sectors. As proposed reforms take shape, leaders like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Aravind Srinivas, Jayshree Ullal, and Arvind Krishna illustrate the tangible benefits of such a programme. Any policy changes must strike a careful balance between national interests, global competitiveness, and the livelihoods of millions of skilled workers who contribute to the US economy.","The h-1b visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the united states’ economy.

What’s really going on in the Katy Perry-Trudeau love story? Source reveals duo ‘are definitely into each other’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-really-going-on-in-the-katy-perry-trudeau-love-story-source-reveals-duo-are-definitely-into-each-other/articleshow/124583312.cms,"A 'supersized attraction'







Pop star Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’s rumoured romance seems to be hitting all the right notes, with sources saying the duo is “definitely into each other.”A Canadian insider told PEOPLE that the pair are “quite taken with each other” and share a mutual respect along with an intellectual bond. “In addition to the attraction, they are both smart and love to talk about serious issues,” the source said.The romance is said to have started in July 2025, when Perry, 40, and Trudeau, 53, were first spotted together in Montreal for a stroll, drinks, and dinner. This came a month after Perry’s split from actor Orlando Bloom and two years after Trudeau ended his 18-year marriage to Sophie Grégoire. Two nights after their initial outing, Trudeau attended Perry’s Montreal concert.A source close to the singer said that when Perry first went out with Trudeau, she was not looking to date, but the pair stayed in touch. “They have many shared interests and a lot to talk about, but Katy was navigating too many things to even think about dating then,” the insider revealed. Trudeau reportedly pursued the connection actively, even flying to California to see Perry during a tour break. “They have an easy connection.She finds him attractive. He’s been very respectful,” the source said.The pair's recent yacht photos, released by the Daily Mail, have gone viral. The images, taken aboard Perry’s 24-metre yacht off Santa Barbara, show the duo engaging in visible PDA. The images, even though blurry, reveal hugging, kissing, and intimate gestures, including Trudeau placing a hand on Perry's bottom.According to a source close to Trudeau, the couple have been taking things slowly due to their busy schedules. Perry is on her Lifetimes World Tour, which continues through December, while Trudeau has family obligations in Canada. “They have stayed in touch since the middle of summer but haven’t been able to spend that much time together, due mainly to her schedule,” the source said.“Justin thinks she is terrific. It has had time to develop on a friend and intellectual level as well as supersized attraction. The romance has merit,” the insider added.Perry appeared to acknowledge the dating rumours during a London tour stop when a fan held up a sign saying, “I heard you're single.” She replied, “You heard I was single? That's interesting.” Neither Perry nor Trudeau has publicly commented on the status of their relationship.Perry shares a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove, with Bloom, and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand. Trudeau shares three children—Xavier, 18, Ella-Grace, 16, and Hadrien, 11—with ex-wife Grégoire.","A canadian insider told people that the pair are “quite taken with each other’ the romance is said to have started in july 2025, when perry, 40, and trudeau, 53, were first spotted together in montreal.

Told students I was more likely to be elected Pope than win Nobel: Mokyr





Stockholm: Three researchers who probed the process of business innovation won the Nobel Prize in economics Monday for explaining how new products and inventions promote economic growth and human welfare, even as they leave older companies in the dust. Their work was credited with helping economists better understand how ideas and technology succeed by disrupting established ways - a process as old as steam locomotives replacing horse-drawn wagons and as contemporary as e-commerce shuttering shopping malls.Joel Mokyr, 79, is at Northwestern University; Philippe Aghion, 69, works at College de France and London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt, 79, is at Brown University.The winners were credited with better explaining and quantifying ""creative destruction"", a key concept in economics that refers to the process in which beneficial new innovations replace - and thus destroy - older technologies and businesses. Examples of creative destruction include e-commerce disrupting retail, streaming services replacing videocassette and DVD rentals and internet advertising undermining newspaper advertising.agenciesThe concept is usually associated with economist Joseph Schumpeter, who outlined it in his 1942 book 'Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'. Schumpeter called the concept ""the essential fact about capitalism"". The Nobel committee said Mokyr ""demonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why"".Aghion and Howitt studied the mechanisms behind sustained growth, including in a 1992 article that offered a complex mathematical model for creative destruction that added new aspects not included in earlier models. ""The laureates' work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underlie creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,"" said John Hassler, chair of the committee for the prize in economic sciences.Mokyr has long been known as an optimist about recent technological innovation. About a decade ago, many economists argued that inventions such as smartphones or even the internet had less of an economic impact than previous developments such as the airplane or the car. Mokyr responded that as new services were either cheap or free, their impact wasn't evident in economic data, but they provided enormous benefits.Mokyr said he was shocked to win the prize. "" I had no clue that anything like this was going to happen,"" he said. His students had asked him about the possibility he would win the Nobel, he said. ""I told them that I was more likely to be elected Pope than to win the Nobel prize in economics.""","Joel mokyr, philippe aghion and peter howitt won the nobel prize in economics.

From Flat Lines to Hockey Sticks



Mokyr: The Marriage of “Know-How” and “Know-Why”



Aghion & Howitt: Growth Through Creative Destruction



Why It Matters



eight





“We’re a planet of six billion ninnies living in a civilisation built by a few thousand savants,” Scott Adams once said — and beneath thecreator's misanthropy is a disarmingly accurate description of how the modern world works. Most of us don’t invent, build, or discover anything of world-changing importance. We live inside systems we didn’t design, using tools we don’t understand, and benefitting daily from the work of people whose names we’ll never know. And yet, we’re quick to criticise those same systems — science, technology, capitalism — that lifted us from the brink of subsistence to a level of prosperity our ancestors couldn’t imagine.It’s precisely this paradox that the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences asks us to confront. It’s also the most controversial of the Nobel family because, strictly speaking, it isn’t a Nobel at all. Alfred Nobel never mentioned economics in his will; the prize was added in 1968 by Sweden’s central bank — a late addition to the family tree. Think of it as Cousin Greg from Succession: the awkward relative who wasn’t invited to dinner but now shows up every Christmas and insists he’s always been part of the family.And yet, this gate-crashing prize may be the most consequential of them all, because economics isn’t just about money. It’s about the deep, often invisible mechanisms that explain how human civilisation stopped crawling and started sprinting.For most of recorded history, humanity went nowhere fast. A peasant in medieval Europe lived much the same life as a farmer in ancient Mesopotamia. Empires rose and fell, plagues came and went, and the occasional invention — a plough here, a printing press there — might briefly improve life. But those improvements rarely built on one another. Progress was sporadic and short-lived. The line of human prosperity was basically flat.Then, about two centuries ago, everything changed. Wealth began to grow exponentially. Populations soared. Cities expanded. Medicine worked. Steam, electricity, combustion and, eventually, computing transformed every corner of life. And instead of slowing down, progress began to accelerate. The question is: why?This year’s Nobel laureates — Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt — offer complementary answers to that question. Together, their work explains why humanity’s growth engine roared to life — and what keeps it running today.Joel Mokyr, an economic historian, argues that the Industrial Revolution wasn’t just about machines — it was about knowledge. Before the 18th century, most human innovation was based on know-how: practical skills, techniques, and tricks. People knew how to do things but not why they worked. Without that deeper understanding, invention couldn’t build on itself. Progress happened in bursts but couldn’t compound.The Enlightenment changed that. Science and technology stopped being separate worlds and started reinforcing each other. Scientific discoveries explained why things worked, which allowed engineers to design better tools and machines. Those tools, in turn, raised new scientific questions. Mokyr calls this cycle “useful knowledge” — a feedback loop between theory and practice that transformed invention from a series of lucky accidents into a self-sustaining system.But knowledge alone wasn’t enough. It needed skilled people to turn ideas into reality — artisans, mechanics, and engineers — and it needed societies willing to embrace disruption. Britain was uniquely placed for this. It had a pool of skilled craftsmen and institutions flexible enough to allow new industries to rise, even when they destroyed old ones. Where older systems punished change, Britain began to reward it — and progress exploded.If Mokyr explains how growth begins, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt explain how it continues. Their core idea is creative destruction — Joseph Schumpeter’s famous term for capitalism’s brutal but productive cycle. In a dynamic economy, new technologies don’t complement the old; they replace them. A company invents a better product, dethrones the market leader, and is itself dethroned by the next innovator. Industries collapse, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge.Beneath the smooth line of GDP growth lies this constant churn — a storm of destruction that fuels creation. It’s not a flaw; it’s the engine. The promise of profit drives firms to innovate, knowing they’ll eventually be replaced. The fear of obsolescence drives them to run faster. And the result is relentless progress.Creative destruction is not without pain. It produces winners and losers. It can move too quickly — wasting resources on marginal improvements — or too slowly, when monopolies choke competition. But without it, economies stagnate. Aghion and Howitt’s work helps explain how societies can manage that balance: encouraging innovation without letting it spiral out of control.The core lesson from this year’s Nobel is deceptively simple: sustained prosperity isn’t natural. It’s engineered. It depends on the marriage of science and technology, on societies that embrace change rather than fear it, and on markets that reward innovation while punishing complacency. It’s why we complain about slow Wi-Fi instead of famine. It’s why we debate the ethics of artificial intelligence instead of the inevitability of plague. And it’s why most of us have never known the grinding poverty, insecurity, and vulnerability that were once the default condition of human life.Yet this system is fragile. It can be undone by monopolies, political short-sightedness, or cultural resistance to change. It can be slowed by hostility to science, censorship, or the temptation to cling to the familiar. If that happens, the line flattens again. Stagnation returns. And the miracle of modernity — the miracle we take for granted — begins to fade.Scott Adams was right: civilisation is the work of a few thousand savants. But those savants are not lone geniuses; they are products of a system built over centuries — a system that turns knowledge into invention, invention into industry, and industry into prosperity. Our job is not to sneer at it but to sustain it. Because Cousin Greg, for all his awkwardness, is the reason we’re here. And without him — without economics — the story of howplus billion ninnies ended up living in a civilisation of unimaginable abundance would make no sense at all.","Joel mokyr, an economic historian, argues that the industrial revolution wasn’t just about machines — it was about knowledge. Philippe aghion and peter howitt explain how growth continues. The core lesson from this year’s nobel is deceptively simple: sustained prosperity isn’t natural.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124528296,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The rise of fast furniture

Forests under pressure

Gen Z's secondhand surge





Every item of furniture in Daniel Santos' Berlin apartment comes with a story. There's the desk that took him deep into the city's former Soviet suburbs, the bed frame he hauled with the help of five housemates, and the nearly century-old dresser he brought back to life with glue and nails.Santos says it's ""crazy"" to think the pale-yellow antique he bought from a grandson parting with his family's heirlooms ""has survived until now.""""Actually a few days ago, I sent him pictures of it in my room, and he was happy to see that it was living on,"" he said.Santos is part of a younger generation of decor scavengers, increasingly aware of furniture's massive carbon footprint and therefore happy to shop secondhand. They don't want to buy things that will be dumped a little further down the line.Globally, researchers estimate at least 51 million tons of furniture are consumed every year with more than 95% of it discarded. That high buy-to-landfill ratio is partially a consequence of ""fast furniture,"" a cousin of""fast fashion"" — cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability.On the rise in recent years, fast furniture's ever-changing styles encourage people to toss furnishings before the end of their natural lifecycle.One study found that British consumers redecorate their homes every one to five years. In a push to ""to stay in style, they turn to inexpensive and disposable furniture that can easily be replaced when their decor changes,"" the authors wrote.And items are often not made to be recyclable. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs — all fused with laminates, resin and glues — which makes them very hard to separate and repurpose.In the United States alone, 12.1 million tons of furniture waste was generated in 2018 with less than 0.5% of it recycled. That's an almost sixfold increase over 1960 levels.Chicago furniture designer CoCo Ree Lemery says the explosion in fast furniture is partially driven by cheap new materials.IKEA's ubiquitous Billy bookcase is a case in point. When it first appeared in the IKEA catalog in 1979, it was made with a wood veneer finish. Since then, it has been redesigned with contact paper, making it cheaper than the original but harder to repair. Today, the company claims to sell a new Billy bookcase every five seconds.Lemery says the influence of fast-fashion brands on home decor design has been another key factor pushing the uptake of cheap furniture.Spanish fast-fashion giant Zara launched its home division in 2003, followed by Swedish rival H&M in 2009. They both helped normalize quick-turn seasonal trends such as rustic wood tables for fall or velvet chairs for winter in home goods stores.Buying trends shows a greater emphasis on cheap, trendy furniture, Lemery said. ""So, a lot of designers and manufacturers and large companies are in fact following that data, despite it not being good for the long run.""As demand for cheap furniture has increased, it's placed pressure on the supply chain and resources.IKEA is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested for industrial purposes each year, the company said.Environmental group Greenpeace has accused the company of felling ancient forests in areas of Romania's Carpathian Mountains that it says should be protected for their high biodiversity value.The furniture giant told DW it had reviewed the Greenpeace report and could confirm that ""the wood used in IKEA products from these forests fully complies with applicable laws."" And with standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) — a global nonprofit that certifies timber production.""Wood from protected old-growth forests is strictly prohibited in our supply chain,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""Nevertheless, we have asked FSC Romania to consider the potential need for further protection following our review.""Flat-pack giants and fast-fashion retailers may be losing sway with first-time furniture buyers.According to research from e-commerce comparison website Capital One Shopping, over a billion people visit the Facebook Marketplace digital classified service every month. An estimated 491 million buy something there. Meanwhile, a trend report from social media platform Pinterest recently said searches for ""secondhand kitchens"" have skyrocketed by 1,012% and ""secondhand decor"" by 283%, with Gen Z users making up half of the site's base.Deana McDonagh, professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says younger consumers are turning to secondhand shopping for a number of reasons: sustainability, frequent moves, tight budgets, limited transport, and also the emotional connection they form with an acquired piece.""With this old furniture, these old chairs, you have to invest in refreshing it,"" McDonagh said, which draws it into a person's story.Santos can relate to that, insisting he wouldn't dream of dumping the dresser he fixed up.Sustainability advocates say reuse is one of the clearest antidotes to fast furniture's environmental toll.""The more that you can source inside your bubble, the better off you're making the world,"" Lemery said","""fast furniture"" is cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs. Ikea is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124508005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
