""So, Prada is selling what are essentially Kolhapuri chappals for Rs 1.2 lakh a pair,"" he said on X.Pointing out that local handicrafts and artisans should be promoted through cultural entrepreneurship, he said: ""We need to invest in skilling, branding, design innovation and global market access for these artisans.

On Saturday, he kicked off the scientific phase of the mission by starting on a cutting-edge biology study investigating muscle loss in microgravity, Axiom Space confirmed.“The crew is now fully immersed in their mission aboard the ISS, wrapping up their second day on orbit with a schedule full of scientific research and international outreach. They have transitioned smoothly from arrival protocols to hands-on research,” the firm said.Shux’s experiment — Myogenesis — was conducted inside the Life Sciences Glovebox. It will investigate the biological pathways behind skeletal muscle degradation in microgravity, one of the most critical challenges facing long-duration spaceflight. The findings could help develop targeted therapies for astronauts on future Moon or Mars missions and for patients on Earth suffering from muscular degenerative diseases.Although Indian-built payloads have flown and delivered data for decades, this is the first time an Indian has directly performed experiments on the ISS.

Mahindra believes this transition offers India a unique opportunity to emerge as a new centre of gravity in what he called ""Globalisation 2.0"".""India, too, will face challenges,"" Mahindra said, noting the evolving nature of global trade marked by shifting alliances, reduced dependence on China-centric supply chains, and diminishing dominance of the US market. He said the world is moving toward a ""multi-polar, regional, and domestically driven"" model of globalisation, in which India is well-positioned to thrive.""Ironically, the US shift toward de-globalisation may lead to a new avatar of globalisation… I believe India is well-positioned to emerge as one of the new centres of gravity,"" Mahindra asserted.He underscored India’s advantages, including its stable democracy, reputation as a reliable partner, and a strong, apolitical military. However, Mahindra cautioned that the future remains uncertain. ""Whether it be a country or a business, the winners will be the ones who can successfully navigate uncertainty and ambiguity—the ones who are resilient.""Referring to geopolitical volatility, Mahindra acknowledged that India faces risks, especially with “our provocative neighbour”, Pakistan. ""I am optimistic that we can demonstrate the limits to our tolerance without impeding our path to economic ascendance,"" he added.He pointed out that US-China decoupling, while uncertain, is likely to continue, impacting trade flows. ""International trade has already slowed amidst heightened uncertainty and dampened investor confidence,"" he said. Industries relying on global supply chains—such as electronics and consumer goods—are particularly vulnerable due to rising input costs, he warned.Mahindra stressed that India must rethink its trade dependencies and diversify sourcing. He predicted increased localisation, re-engineered supply chains, and the formation of new trade networks globally. India’s trade deficit, sectoral vulnerabilities, and rising competition must be addressed strategically.""The challenge will be to minimise the adverse effects, akin to how Lord Shiva confined the poison to his throat without letting it spread,"" Mahindra said, invoking the mythological reference of Samudra Manthan. But he urged India not to merely mitigate risks but seize this shift as a growth opportunity.""Instead, we can proactively view this as an opportunity to enable some 'Amrit' to emerge,"" he said. Mahindra emphasised that private enterprise must lead this economic transformation with speed and agility.India could benefit from China's adversarial stance, which may open up new opportunities in supply chains. Mahindra said India must focus on innovation, R&D, and manufacturing to capture market share from global competitors. ""Restrictions on China and high tariffs for other competing countries could open new markets for Indian goods,"" he said.To make the most of the moment, Mahindra warned, India must act swiftly. ""Speed and agility are essential, as countries like the Philippines and Vietnam are already touting themselves as future manufacturing hubs. We must act swiftly and strategically to secure our share of the Amrit.""","Anand mahindra believes this transition offers india a unique opportunity to emerge as a new centre of gravity.

Was KayDianna Garza punished for exposing DCC secrets?

KayDianna Garza, a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader (DCC) and a key figure in Netflix's ""America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders"" Season 2, recently concluded her tenure with the squad. Her withdrawal followed a challenging period where she became the first leader after veteran Chandi Dayle's resignation due to a rule violation during a team trip to the Bahamas.KayDianna Garza, a fourth-year DCC member for the 2024-2025 NFL season, initially joined in 2021 to ‘validate her own abilities,’ stating, ""All my life people believed that I was a great performer and dancer, but I never believed that myself. Trying out for DCC was my way of showing myself what everyone else saw in me!"" She especially valued the emphasis on ‘sisterhood’ and giving back.The ""Bahamas incident"" significantly disrupted the DCC. Chandi Dayle allegedly violated policy by sharing the team's hotel with an unknown man. Dayle explained, ""I was just kind of crumbling down and I was like, 'Dang, I feel like I have no one here to talk to, so it's nice to have someone to confide in.' I broke a DCC rule and had time with my friend. It was probably the wrong place and time to do that, but selfishly, I had to do it for me because I feel like I was just losing it."" Judy Trammell, DCC's head choreographer, validated Dayle's ""leave of absence,"" leading to Garza's promotion.Assuming leadership brought personal setbacks for KayDianna Garza. A TikTok Live, where she briefly mentioned Dayle's situation and hinted at a video to ""talk about the whole thing,"" went viral, resulting in her suspension for ""being a bully and harassing.""Feeling the situation unbearable and unsupported, she decided to take herself out of the organization and respect herself. Garza stated, ""I definitely didn't feel supported, I felt like I was just a body. It was as if Chandi got the perks of being a first leader and I got the responsibility part of it."" Kelli Kelli Finglass verified Garza's exit was ""her choice.”On April 27, 2025, Garza announced her departure on Instagram: ""After prayerful consideration, I have made the decision to step away from my role with the Dallas Cowboys organization. While this was not the ending I had envisioned, it is one I felt led to make for myself, in full faith and peace. I'm deeply grateful for four unforgettable seasons—filled with growth, meaningful friendships, and memories that will stay with me forever. ""KayDianna Garza added, ""Though this door has closed, I trust fully in God's plan and the new doors he is preparing to open. I do not view this as a setback, but as a divine setup for what's next.

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.",Authors accuse microsoft of copyright infringement.

70% of Indian teens spend 7 hours online: ISKCON monk warns of mental health fallout

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.","Sundar pichai's iit batchmate gauranga das who turned'monk' looks younger than him; his reason: 'you deal with google, i deal with god' 70% of indian teens spend 7 hours online: iskcon monk warns of mental health fallout.

Pop star meets rising QB: Viral burger outing fuels unlikely romance buzz

College football just collided with pop stardom—and it’s not because of a touchdown. Sabrina Carpenter , the chart-topping singer currently dominating headlines for her bold performances and empowering messages, is now at the center of a budding dating rumor with Oregon quarterback Luke Moga. The pair were recently spotted sharing a casual meal in Eugene, Oregon, and it didn’t take long for the photo to explode across social media.The unexpected pairing— Sabrina Carpenter in her pink pop prime and Luke Moga, a redshirt freshman who has yet to take a college snap—has sent fans into a frenzy. While neither party has confirmed anything romantic, the internet is doing what it does best: fueling the speculation with memes, jokes, and full-blown shipping. And it wasn’t just fans who chimed in.Cleveland Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel, who previously played at Oregon, threw fuel on the fire with a playful Instagram story after the viral burger date. Sharing the image, he wrote: “Hard launch bro! Happy for you guys.” The cheeky remark instantly sparked even more buzz, with Ducks fans declaring Moga “QB1”—not just on the field, but in the dating game too.Gabriel’s comment may have been in jest, but it amplified the attention Moga is receiving both as a potential starter and as a rising social media personality.For a quarterback who hasn’t even made his collegiate debut, being linked to Sabrina Carpenter is the kind of PR that can elevate a brand overnight.Moga is far from just a viral sensation. The dual-threat quarterback threw for nearly 1,900 yards and 23 touchdowns in his senior year of high school, while rushing for over 650 yards and 12 touchdowns. Oregon head coach Dan Lanning has praised the depth in his quarterback room, and now with Moga gaining national attention, that spotlight only intensifies.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Whether it’s a real romance or a media-driven moment, one thing is clear: Luke Moga is suddenly a name fans—and maybe even rivals—won’t forget.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.s. jaishankar launches passport seva 2.0 in india.

Investment will continue, with or without Microsoft: Softbank CEO

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, the Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.The software giant recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Masayoshi Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son said OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He reportedly aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","Softbank ceo masayoshi son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (ai) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion japanese yen (around $33.2 billion) son said he believes openai, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122111217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22694,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘It's not too late to change course’: Bill Gates

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), he warned that this could result in an additional 8 million child deaths by 2024. Gates cited a Lancet study on the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. “It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday. To give some context for 8 million: That's how many children live in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio combined,” Gates said.In the post, he writes “When the United States and other governments suddenly cut their aid budgets, I know for a fact that more children will die.”He said he has worked in the global health space for over 25 years and has seen how important aid is in saving lives. “Over the past 25 years—the same span of time I spent leading Microsoft—I have immersed myself in global health: building knowledge, deepening expertise, and working to save lives from deadly diseases and preventable causes. During that time, I have built teams of world-class scientists and public health experts at the Gates Foundation , studied health systems across continents, and worked in close partnership with national and local leaders to strengthen the delivery of lifesaving care,” he writes.“Global health aid saves lives. And when that aid is withdrawn—abruptly and without a plan—lives are lost,” Gates warned. “At this point, I know as much about improving health in poor countries as I do about software,” he further stated.Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that U.S. cuts to global health aid are already causing problems. He pointed out that important programs like tuberculosis testing and malaria prevention are slowing down, and life-saving medicines are getting delayed.Gates recently visited Nigeria and Ethiopia and said he saw for himself how healthcare services there are being affected by the funding cuts.Still, Gates said there is time to fix the situation. “It’s not too late to change course,” he wrote on X. He urged the U.S. Congress to restore funding for major programs such as PEPFAR (the U.S. plan for AIDS relief) and the Global Fund.",Microsoft founder and former ceo bill gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of us government cutting funding for global health.

Intel’s top strategy executive, Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah , is reportedly departing the company. This marks the latest leadership change since Lip-Bu Tan assumed leadership of the US-based chipmaker in March. This exit follows Intel's recent announcement of layoff plans. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Yeboah-Amankwah, who has served as Intel's chief strategy officer since 2020, will leave on June 30. The publication cited two individuals familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously to report this development. His responsibilities included overseeing growth initiatives, strategic partnerships, and equity investments for Intel.“We are grateful for Saf’s contributions to Intel and wish him the best,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.As per the Reuters report, some of Yeboah-Amankwah's strategic functions will now be handled by Sachin Katti, who was recently promoted to chief technology and AI officer at Intel. Moreover, Intel Capital, the company's venture arm, will now report directly to Lip-Bu Tan, two sources have confirmed to Reuters on the matter.Last week, Intel reportedly announced the dates for upcoming job cuts, confirming that layoffs would begin on July 15. According to a report by CRN, the company is starting the layoffs with 107 workers connected to its headquarters in Santa Clara, California.The move was part of a broader cost-cutting and restructuring initiative introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan in April this year to help improve the company’s performance.As per the report, Intel filed a notice under California’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The company stated in the filing that affected employees would either receive a 60-day notice or a four-week notice accompanied by nine weeks of pay and benefits.In a statement to the publication, an Intel spokesperson said: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organisational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution.”","Safroadu yeboah-amankwah has served as intel's chief strategy officer since 2020.

After a chastening crackdown that wiped billions off their value and forced top executives out of the public eye, China's technology giants are back in favour and on the front foot, making deals and snapping up assets.At the top of the pile are Alibaba Group and Tencent , two huge players that used to compete for acquisitions until their wings were clipped by Chinese authorities concerned about their wide and powerful reach. Nowadays, with China's economy struggling to pick up much growth momentum and tensions with the US and others rumbling on, the govt's stance has shifted, especially with regard to key areas such as AI and tech more broadly.Tencent's music platform agreed to buy podcasting startup Ximalaya this month, a step forward in its bid to be China's Spotify. That followed a Tencent subsidiary snapping up a nearly 10% stake in SM Entertainment, a rare Chinese investment into a South Korean company in recent years.In April, Ant Group -- of Alibaba pioneer Jack Ma, who disappeared from view in 2020 after criticising regulators - became controlling shareholder of Bright Smart Securities.

What Customers Should Do Next







Emirates NBD has addressed recent customer concerns regarding international money transfer fees, assuring that its popular DirectRemit service will continue to offer free transfers to six major remittance destinations, including India, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and the UK.Following an email notification sent to customers on Friday, which stated that from September 1, 2025, a transfer fee of Dh26.25 (inclusive of VAT) would apply to all international transfers via the bank’s digital platforms, many customers expressed worry about the end of zero-fee remittances.In a clarification statement sent in response to media reports, the bank said: “To clarify: Emirates NBD will not be charging Dh26 for remittances to key corridors such as India, Pakistan, Egypt, and the Philippines. These corridors will remain free of charge for our customers. The Dh26 fee applies only to non-core corridors, in line with Central Bank regulations.”Further emphasizing the commitment to its customers, the spokesperson said: “Emirates NBD remains committed to offering seamless and cost-effective banking solutions for our valued customers. As part of this commitment, Emirates NBD DirectRemit Transfers to India, Pakistan, Egypt, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and the UK will continue to be offered free of charge to all Emirates NBD customers.”The Dh26.25 fee will only apply to international transfers sent to countries outside the bank’s designated zero-fee corridors, and only when transfers are initiated via online, mobile banking, or the ENBD X digital channels. Transfers within the six core countries will continue to have no charge, provided the transfer amount meets the minimum threshold of Dh100.The bank is also expanding its DirectRemit service to over 30 additional countries, allowing customers to benefit from near real-time transfers. The spokesperson added:“Customers will no longer be charged any correspondent bank fees and will just be charged a nominal transfer fee of up to Dh26.25 (inclusive of VAT). All other international transfers will also incur a nominal fee of up to Dh26.25. These charges will be effective from September 1, 2025.”Additionally, Emirates NBD’s Private Banking, Priority Banking, and Personal Banking Beyond customers will continue to enjoy free DirectRemit and international transfers as usual.DirectRemit is a digital money transfer service enabling Emirates NBD customers to send money quickly, within 60 seconds, to India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and the UK. This ease and speed have made it a preferred choice for many expatriates in the UAE.O utside of Emirates NBD, there are other apps such as Botim, Careem Pay, e& money, and Taptap Send, which offer free or minimal fees for money transfers from the UAE. Some of these apps require no registration fees, no minimum balance, and no bank account—only an active UAE mobile number, a debit or credit card, or online banking access.These apps not only facilitate global and local money transfers but also support bill payments, merchant payments, and transfers directly to mobile wallets.The UAE ranks as the third-largest sender of remittances worldwide, after the US and Saudi Arabia. Last year, Indian expatriates sent $21.6 billion to India from the UAE, representing 19.2% of the country’s total dollar inflows, making the UAE the second-largest source of global remittance to India after the US.Filipino workers in the UAE remitted approximately $1.52 billion in 2024, contributing to the Philippines’ record $38.34 billion in total overseas remittances for that year, as reported by Statista and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Philippine Central Bank). Major sources of these remittances include the US, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the UAE.Emirates NBD is preparing to send electronic direct mails (EDMs) to customers affected by the fee changes and plans to release a formal press statement to further clarify the details.Customers are encouraged to check the list of eligible zero-fee corridors on their Emirates NBD app or online platform before initiating transfers to confirm whether their intended destination qualifies for free remittance.","Emirates nbd confirmed that its directremit transfers to india, uk, philippines, pakistan, egypt, and sri lanka will remain free of charge despite the upcoming dh26.25 fee for other countries.

While global attention often lingers on freight disruptions and shipping capacity, a more transformational shift is quietly unfolding between India and the United Arab Emirates. The two economies are not simply moving more goods—they are reimagining the infrastructure that enables it. At the center of this transformation is the India–Dubai corridor—where bilateral investments, joint digital systems, and co-developed logistics hubs are setting a new benchmark for regional trade cooperation.From deep-sea ports in Gujarat to dry port ecosystems in Maharashtra, and from Dubai’s electric vehicle–equipped logistics hubs to shared cargo visibility platforms, a next-generation trade corridor is taking shape. This is not just about improving trade. It is about engineering interdependence through concrete, code, and coordinated policy.In January 2025, DP World confirmed a $2.5 billionglobal investment package, with a significant share allocated to Indian logistics partnerships and multimodal corridors connecting the subcontinent to the UAE. “This US$ $2.5 billion commitment reflects our confidence in long-term trade growth and our determination to build the infrastructure needed to keep the world connected,” H.E. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World, had then emphasised.The Tuna Tekra terminal in Gujarat, developed in partnership with Adani Ports, is a flagship project. The facility includes a 1.1-kilometre berth, advanced handling equipment, and direct rail access to India’s Western Dedicated Freight Corridor. It is already being positioned as a key node for cargo headed toward the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.“Gujarat’s port infrastructure is no longer just for maritime throughput—it’s becoming a base for integrated, value-added logistics,” said an official at India’s Ministry of Ports.On the other side of the Arabian Sea, Jebel Ali Port continues to evolve. With over 1,000 Indian companiesoperating out of its Free Zone, and increasing warehousing demand from Indian exporters of electronics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, Dubai’s role is shifting from a gateway to a collaborative hub. This deepening integration between Indian exporters and Dubai’s multimodal logistics network is now being reinforced by a shared emphasis on sustainability and innovation—marking a new phase in the bilateral trade journey.Sustainability is no longer a talking point—it is a design principle. At JNPT, India’s busiest container port, a $131 millionmodernisation initiative funded by the Asian Development Bank is installing electric cranes, upgrading yards, and integrating solar energy into port operations.“Enhancing trade infrastructure is no longer about volume alone. It’s about climate resilience, smart energy, and urban integration,” said Ashok Lavasa, Vice-President for Private Sector Operations and Public–Private Partnerships – Asian Development Bank (ADB)Across the Gulf, DP World’s Jebel Ali Port is deploying AI-enabled route planning for electric terminal vehicles. The model draws on lessons from the company’s Callao port in Peru, where EV deployment saved 2,400 tonnesof CO₂ in just over a year.India’s Jalna Dry Port in Maharashtra is another vital node in the corridor. Once operational, it will process up to 10 million TEUs annually, directly linking central India’s industries to global export lanes via JNPT and Tuna Tekra.“India’s freight corridors and dry port ecosystems are starting to mirror the integrated logistics we’ve built in Dubai—tailored for domestic scale and rural access,” said a DP World infrastructure planner involved in Indian operations.Dubai is responding in kind.
