NEW DELHI: Cyber-attacks emanating from Pakistan have further increased, with the website of an Indian defence PSU being defaced while Pakistani hackers also claiming to have gained access to ""sensitive"" data from the Indian Military Engineering Services (MES) and think-tank Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).The hacker group called ""Pakistan Cyber Force"" has allegedly compromised personal information of defence personnel in MES and MP-IDSA, including their login credentials.""In addition to this data breach , the hacker group also defaced the official website of defence PSU Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (AVNL) with images of the Pakistan flag and the Al Khalid tank,"" a source said on Monday.As a precautionary measure, the AVNL website has been taken offline for ""a thorough and deliberate audit"" to assess the extent of any potential damage and its integrity.

REAL ID deadline hits May 7: TSA to enforce new airport rules



How and where to get a REAL ID



In-person applications

REAL ID applications must typically be completed in person. Applicants must bring:

Proof of identity (e.g., birth certificate or passport)

Proof of Social Security number

Two proofs of residency (e.g., utility bill, lease agreement)

As the May 7, 2025, deadline for REAL ID enforcement approaches, millions of Americans are rushing to obtain compliant identification cards. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon require travelers to present a REAL ID or other federally accepted identification at airport security checkpoints. However, this urgency has triggered a sharp rise in online scams designed to exploit consumers. From fake websites to phishing texts and misleading social media posts, fraudsters are targeting those who may be unfamiliar with the application process or anxious about the impending deadline. These fraudulent schemes aim to steal personal and financial data under the guise of providing expedited REAL ID services.Cybercriminals have launched a variety of fake websites that mimic state DMV portals. These sites request sensitive personal data under the pretense of processing REAL ID applications. Some also charge illegitimate processing fees or redirect users to malicious links.Spoofed emails often accompany these scams. They may contain official-looking logos and language to appear legitimate, asking recipients to “verify” their identity or “complete” their application with a payment of around $35 for so-called “expedited” processing.Phishing text messages have also emerged, with messages instructing users to click on links to apply for or confirm their REAL ID. These messages typically contain shortened URLs and pressure language like “Immediate Action Required.”On social media platforms, scammers have posted advertisements or comments promoting fake REAL ID services. Some link directly to phishing websites, while others encourage users to call fake customer support lines.Consumers should be aware of several red flags when navigating REAL ID applications:If you receive a suspicious message or visit a questionable website:To apply for a REAL ID, individuals should go directly to their state DMV's official website. Each site has a dedicated section for REAL ID information, application instructions, documentation checklists, and online scheduling tools.In the event that personal data has been compromised, individuals are encouraged to place a credit freeze with the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. This prevents any new credit accounts from being opened in their name.Anyone who believes their identity has been stolen should visit identitytheft.gov. This federal resource walks users through the steps of creating a recovery plan and filing reports with the appropriate agencies.Regularly checking bank and credit card statements can help detect fraudulent activity early. Setting up transaction alerts is also recommended.The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It establishes minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. A REAL ID-compliant card will be required to:REAL IDs are marked with a star at the top of the card. They are issued by state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMVs), but adhere to federal guidelines set by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).After multiple postponements, the TSA will begin enforcing the REAL ID requirement on May 7, 2025. Travelers who do not have a REAL ID or another form of approved identification (such as a U.S. passport) will not be permitted to pass through airport security checkpoints for domestic travel.Due to this imminent enforcement date, DMVs across the country have experienced a surge in applications. In Virginia, for example, the Department of Motor Vehicles reported that REAL ID cards accounted for 61% of all active licenses as of April 2025. A total of 166,816 REAL ID cards were issued in Virginia that month alone—a 60% increase compared to March 2025.Many DMVs offer walk-in service as well as online appointment booking. Some also provide virtual ticketing systems where users can reserve a spot in line remotely.","The may 7, 2025, deadline for real id enforcement approaches.

15-time Pro Bowler, Tom Brady, shared that Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman, Rodney Harrison, and Wes Welker weren’t all high picks

channel co-host, Mike Majlak, asked 7-time Super Bowl Champion, Tom Brady , “We are talking about going late in the draft. Elephant in the room. Shedeur Sanders . What happened, Tom? Why, why, why did he go so late in the draft?” The 47-year-old FOX Sports broadcaster took a moment of silence before answering that question. He went monosyllabic for a moment and then took a deep breath and said, “That’s a good question.” An X user commented, “Tip toed all around that question.”But that’s not all that the 5-time Super Bowl MVP said. Tom Brady gave a lengthy explanation to that tricky question, only because he could connect with Shedeur Sanders. Only because - he, too, was a late pick! 199th overall pick - 6th round! Drafted by the New England Patriots. Let’s hear about his ordeal and what he advised the 144th pick and rookie quarterback for the Cleveland Browns , Shedeur Sanders.Before going straight to Shedeur Sanders, Tom Brady said, “That’s the problem with media - everyone can just say whatever the f*ck they want and get away with it. It’s kind of unfortunate, coz there actually used to be a lot of integrity in media, and there’s way less now because everyone needs crazy voices to get heard, and it actually, probably hurts a lot of relationships, which is not the goal of broadcasting. It should be to develop, and cultivate, and solve problems, and rather than critiques, I want people to offer solutions all the time.”Bringing his focus to Shedeur Sanders, Tom Brady said, ""So, nobody knows - I actually texted Shedeur coz I have known him very well. I said, “Dude, whatever happens, wherever you go, that’s your first day. Day 2 matters more than the draft.”I was 199! So, who could speak on it better than me? Like, what does that really mean? Use it as motivation. You’re going to get your chances. Go take advantage of it. Wherever you end up going, it’s about your performance. Like, what do you do when you get there? Because you’re gonna get there.”Brady shared, “I was around some of the best players who were undrafted free agents - Rodney Harrison wasn’t a high pick. Julian Edelman wasn’t a high pick. Wes Welker wasn’t a high pick. Danny Amendola - all those guys were phenomenal players.So, what’s it matter? Other than some overhyped day where a lot of people are selling stories and saying, “Alright, this is the big day and this is the draft.”It’s an important day, and it’s fun. I love watching it and seeing it. But, I have also been there on Day 2, and they gotta show up and learn a playbook, learn to be a part of a locker room. There’s a lot of growth that needs to happen.”",Tom brady advised cleveland browns rookie quarterback shedeur sanders that day 2 matters more than the draft.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

""It's a comprehensive package with good commitment on investments, mobility (easier visas) and lowering costs, helping companies make more aggressive bids (for contracts),"" said an official.Easier access for Indian business visitors and professionals was a key demand from the Indian side in return for lowering import duties on products of interest to the UK, led by Scotch and automobiles. Besides, govt has agreed to open procurement for British companies, something that it did for the UAE under the trade and economic agreement.Market access for govt procurement will, however, be limited to non-sensitive central level entities, and there is no commitment to allow companies from the UK to participate in state or local bodies' contracts.While the environment chapter has commitments from India, govt officials said the agreement factors in the different development status of both sides and their national priorities. In the case of labour, however, there is only a provision for cooperation and an institutional mechanism for discussing issues related to skill development, capacity building, and information sharing with carve-outs for state govts and local bodies. ""These chapters do not have a dispute settlement mechanism,"" explained an officer.The UK has, however, not agreed to offer any concessions under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, with India having the right to retaliate.","Indian tech and management professionals, engineers, and r&d advisors will be among the beneficiaries of an easier visa regime under the trade deal with the uk. This includes 1,800 annual visas for musicians, chefs, and yoga instructors. The uk has also offered significant commitments for digitally delivered services for indian suppliers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120980161,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Shares of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, plunged more than 5% on Wednesday following revelations from a federal antitrust trial and developments tied to cybersecurity and energy infrastructure.As of 12:17 p.m., Alphabet Inc.'s Class C stock was trading at $151.41, marking a sharp decline of $13.79 or 8.35% for the day.At the heart of the market reaction was testimony by Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, who told a Washington court that Google’s search traffic on Apple products declined last month. Cue attributed the drop to growing competition from AI-powered search alternatives such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, signalling a potential shift in user behaviour away from traditional search engines.""That has never happened in 20 years,"" legal news outlet MLex quoted him as saying.Cue was giving testimony in a trial in which US Judge Amit Mehta will determine how Google must address his landmark ruling last year that it operates an illegal monopoly in online search.The Apple executive's remarks saw Google's market capitalization wiped of $140 billion since the close of trading on Wall Street on Tuesday.The marathon court case has revealed that Google pays Apple tens of billions of dollars every year in a revenue sharing agreement in which Google's search engine is set as the default on Apple's Safari browser.Markets were also rattled by Cue's comment that ""over the coming year we will add other (AI) choices to the search engine choice in the browser, because I think those products are getting better and better,"" he said, according to MLex.Meanwhile, Google disclosed it has identified a new strain of malware dubbed “LOSTKEYS,” linked to the Russia-based hacking group Cold River. According to Wesley Shields of the Google Threat Intelligence Group, the malware is capable of stealing files and transmitting system information to attackers. Shields noted that LOSTKEYS represents a new advancement in Cold River’s arsenal.Cold River, which has ties to Russia’s Federal Security Service, has been associated with numerous cyber campaigns targeting high-profile Western individuals and organizations, including NATO governments, NGOs, former intelligence officers, and individuals with connections to Ukraine. Recent activity from the group was observed as recently as January, March, and April 2025. A notable past operation included the targeting of US nuclear research labs in 2022 and the leak of private emails from former British intelligence chief Richard Dearlove.Meanwhile, Google announced a major partnership with nuclear developer Elementl Power to construct three advanced nuclear power plants in the United States. Each facility is expected to produce at least 600 megawatts of electricity—enough to power a large-scale data center—as tech companies scramble to meet the surging energy demands brought on by the generative AI boom.Google will provide early-stage capital for the projects, which will be developed in collaboration with utility and regulatory partners to secure appropriate locations. Amanda Peterson Corio, Google's Global Head of Data Center Energy, said the initiative reinforces the company’s goal of strengthening the energy grid. She emphasized that advanced nuclear energy offers “reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy” crucial for supporting AI and innovation.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that electricity usage by data centres will more than double by 2030, posing significant challenges to power infrastructure—challenges this partnership seeks to address.","Alphabet inc.'s class c stock was trading at $151.41, marking a sharp decline of $13.79 or 8.35% for the day.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol.
