NEW DELHI: India's exports to China have increased 37% to $14.2 billion during April-Dec, govt told Rajya Sabha Friday, with shipments during the last month of 2025 jumping 67% to over $2 billion.Imports during the first nine months were up 13.5% to nearly $96 billion, latest data from the commerce department showed.In Parliament, junior minister for commerce and industry Jitin Prasada said that most of the goods imported from China are capital goods, intermediate goods and raw materials.Replying to a question, he said that during the previous financial year, 2024-25, sectors such as fertilisers (61.4%), chemicals (19.7%), iron and steel (10.3%) and man-made yarn (9.5%) have seen lower imports from China in 2024-25.""In 2024-25, a decline in imports from China was observed across several sectors compared to the previous year,"" Prasada said, responding to a question on India's trade balance with China.He also said active pharmaceutical ingredients, auto components, electronic parts and assemblies and mobile phone parts are imported and then used for making finished products.""These goods are imported for meeting the demand of fast expanding sectors like electronics, pharma, telecom and power in India.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in maharashtra for chhatrapati shivaji maharaj jayanti.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

6. How do the changes impact different industries?

7. Which sector is expected to make the highest provisions?

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for q3fy26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

There also seems to be an overall focus on female streamers and their struggle for visibility and recognition in such an ever-growing field.Currently, Emiru resumes her usual streaming activities and remains active with her association with her fans through Twitch as well as other platforms. Though her comments have not generated any major controversy, these have encouraged debate among her fans regarding the activities associated with copying as well as credit in the virtual streaming scene.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by wednesday’s (february 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of january.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.","Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its amazon fresh supermarket chain.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google ceo sundar pichai and nvidia ceo jensen huang dismiss market panic over ai plugins, calling it overblown.

How Roman Reigns and Galina Becker built their massive fortune

Inside the Roman Reigns Anoaʻi family assets and lifestyle

Leati Joseph Anoaʻi, better known as Roman Reigns, and his partner, Galina Becker, are now among the richest couples in professional wrestling. Reigns has gone from WWE prospect to the top man in the ring in ten years, a role that creates lucrative paychecks and international fame. Becker, an ex-college athlete and fitness model, has kept her own presence outside of the ring as well.Collectively, the duo has slowly accumulated a well-documented pot of gold that the media believes is worth up to $23 million in 2026. That figure reflects income from wrestling contracts, endorsements, business interests, and personal investments. Celebrity net worth figures are always debatable, and the combined bankability of Roman Reigns and Galina Becker is a testament to how wisely and proactively the two have handled opportunities beyond the ring.Roman Reigns has been a part of the WWE franchise for quite a long time, and that forms the basis of the household wealth. He is one of the most compensated performers in the company, meaning he has a guaranteed annual earnings plus match bonuses, merchandise royalties, and premium event payouts. Year after year, main event appearances in WrestleMania and other big shows where he fought have bolstered his income. His rise to mainstream fame has also uncovered new avenues, such as sponsorships, appearances in media, or even acting possibilities, which all add to his value.Taking the financial lead, if with less headline, is still the dark horse in Galina Becker. Becker, a former track and field athlete, has experience in fitness modeling and brand partnerships. Taelor has worked with lifestyle and wellness brands and has engaged in small side hustles that create independent income. Becker has also kept her own career, one of the factors that has given the couple's finances some stability, unlike many of the partners of celebrities. With a little top-tier athlete pay and business income on the side, the family has learned to have income streams available in case disaster strikes on any one front.More than the annual income, the couple’s portfolio includes hard assets and long-term brand equity. The family spends most of their time in Florida at their luxury home, planned for seclusion and comfort. They have plenty of luxury cars, travel, and personal investments in their portfolio, but the biggest asset is still Roman, a worldwide entertainment brand that will only continue to appreciate in value.Part of that reputation also comes from their Anoaʻi wrestling legacy. Roman Reigns is part of one of the most storied families in wrestling history, and that lineage adds to endorsement and merchandise appeal.

The exchange had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the accidental distribution this week.Bithumb said in a statement to CNBC.The crypto exchange reportedly had planned to distribute small cash rewards of 2,000 Korean won ($1.40) or more to each user as part of a promotional event, but winners instead received at least 2,000 bitcoins each.The company also admitted that the error briefly causedin bitcoin prices on the platform as some recipients sold the tokens, adding that it brought the situation under control within five minutes.Bithumb’s charts showed the token's price fell 17% to 81.1 million won on the platform after the incident.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is moving forward with a Schengen-style unified tourist visa that will allow travellers to enter all six GCC member countries including Saudi Arabia , the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman, with a single permit. While official launch details are still being finalised and pilot phases are expected later in 2026, governments and travel experts say that the entire application will be completed online through a dedicated portal, streamlining what used to be six separate visa requests into one digital process.Once the system goes live, here is how applicants can expect to apply and what documents will likely be required.Before you even begin the online application, gather the essential paperwork that most unified visa systems, including those described in official plans, will require:Other supporting documents (e.g., invitation letters, business letters) may be requested depending on your nationality or purpose of travel but the core list above forms the baseline expected for unified tourist visa applications.When the unified GCC visa formally launches (likely late 2026 with pilot tests first before full rollout), authorities will open a central online portal where applicants submit their form and upload documents.While names and domain specifics of the platform have not yet been finalised publicly, it will function similarly to other e-visa systems with clear instructions and progress tracking.Once on the portal:This consolidated form replaces separate visa applications previously needed for each GCC country under current rules.Visa authorities are reportedly considering a fee in the US $100 to $150 range (roughly AED 367 to AED 550) for the unified visa, which will be competitive with existing single-country tourist permits while offering freer multi-nation travel once approved. Payment usually occurs at the end of the application process via secure online methods (credit card or international payment gateways). Ensure that your card supports international transactions.After submission and successful verification:Print the visa (or save it on your phone) for presentation at immigration checkpoints upon arrival in the Gulf region.The GCC Unified Visa 2026 aims to dramatically simplify travel across the Gulf by allowing travellers to enter and move freely between the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman with a single online application and one set of documents instead of six.Though the final official rollout details including exact fees, validity periods and launch date are still being finalised, preparation now will help you be ready to apply smoothly when the system opens.","Gcc is moving forward with a schengen-style unified tourist visa.

UAE: Sheikh Hamdan inaugurates driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sheikh-hamdan-inaugurates-driverless-rt6-taxi-operations-in-dubai/articleshow/127971112.cms,"Sheikh Hamdan launched driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026/Image: Dubai Media Office





Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Sheikh hamdan launched driverless rt6 taxi operations in dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026.

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into china's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128024592,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1235780,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

A movement built on hope and action





From idea to regional platform





Recognition and lasting impact









The UAE will host the closing ceremony of the sixth edition of Arab Hope Makers on February 15 at Dubai’s Coca-Cola Arena, in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. The ceremony will honour leading humanitarian initiatives from across the Arab world and announce a winner who will receive an AED1 million award.Arab Hope Makers has grown into the region’s largest humanitarian initiative, celebrating individuals and organisations that devote their time, effort and resources to improving lives. The initiative focuses on voluntary, non-profit efforts that address real challenges, from alleviating suffering to strengthening social, educational, cultural and economic environments.Since its launch in 2017, the initiative has attracted more than 335,000 Hope Makers across the Arab world. The sixth edition alone received 15,802 nominations, reflecting continued public engagement and a growing culture of giving and community service.The initiative was first announced in 2017 through a creative message shared by Sheikh Mohammed on his official social media accounts, offering a role titled Hope Maker with a reward of AED1 million.The response exceeded expectations, drawing over 65,000 submissions from individuals, volunteer groups and humanitarian organisations, far above the original target of 20,000.Over the years, the initiative has evolved beyond a single award into a platform that highlights impactful humanitarian ideas and supports their expansion. It also led to the launch of the Hope Makers Academy, a AED50 million programme designed to strengthen Arab humanitarian work. The academy supports promising projects by transferring global expertise and offering specialised leadership and executive training in collaboration with leading experts and institutions.Each edition concludes with a public ceremony that honours finalists and announces the top Hope Maker. Last year’s event was attended by 12,000 people, including humanitarian and cultural leaders. The fifth edition saw Ahmed Zainoun from Morocco named the top Hope Maker for his initiative to treat children with xeroderma pigmentosum, known as Children of the Moon. Two other finalists were also awarded AED1 million each, bringing the total prize value to AED3 million.Speaking about the initiative, Sheikh Mohammed has described hope as a driving force that fuels determination and progress. In a message shared on X, he said that optimism spreads across people and institutions, and that planting the seeds of hope leads to generations committed to serving their communities and believing in achievement.Mohammad Al Gergawi, Secretary General of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, has said the initiative reflects a vision that places generosity and giving at the heart of Arab society. By spotlighting inspiring philanthropy and innovative humanitarian action, he noted, Arab Hope Makers has empowered hundreds of thousands of people with the confidence and insight to transform community and volunteer work.As the sixth edition draws to a close in Dubai, Arab Hope Makers continues to position hope not as an abstract idea, but as practical action that reshapes lives and communities across the region.","Sheikh mohammed will honour the sixth arab hope makers winner with a dh1 million prize.
