NEW DELHI: Government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth, PM Narendra Modi said on Saturday while virtually distributing 51,000 appointment letters for central government jobs, with this over 10 lakh recruitment letters have been issued through Rozgar melas since October 2022.Addressing the new recruits, PM Modi said the world acknowledges that India has two limitless strengths, one in demography and the other in democracy, the largest youth population and the world's biggest democracy.""This power of youth is both the greatest asset and the strongest guarantee for Bharat's bright future. Our government is working day and night to turn this strength into a formula for prosperity.""Modi said every individual deserves the opportunity to move ahead and it's the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand. ""And you, my friends, are young. I have great faith in you. I have high expectations from you. Wherever you're assigned, you must always put the citizens first. Helping them, easing their difficulties-that alone will push the nation forward rapidly.""Modi said besides giving permanent government jobs, his administration is also focusing on creating new employment opportunities in the private sector.Referring to the recent Cabinet decision on the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, he said the government will provide Rs 15,000 to a youth getting their first job in the private sector, which means the first month's salary of such employees will be borne by the government.For this, Rs 1 lakh crore has been allocated, he said.Highlighting a recently released report of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Modi said it found more than 90 crore citizens in India have been brought under the umbrella of welfare schemes over the last decade, which is essentially an expansion of social security. He also spoke about the achievement of nearly 25 crore people rising out of poverty by ""defeating poverty with their strength and courage"".The PM said global institutions like the World Bank are openly praising India for this achievement and it's now being ranked among the top countries in the world in terms of equality. ""This means inequality is decreasing rapidly, and we are moving toward greater equality. The world is now taking note of this transformation,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi said government should never be a hurdle and should always be a facilitator of growth.

MUMBAI: The preliminary report of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the June 12 Air India flight 171 crash in Ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the Boeing-787's fuel control switch which indicates a potential equipment malfunction, but deemed it was not an unsafe condition.The AAIB report mentioned that the fuel switches of engine one and two of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft were cut off within a gap of one second and later turned on before the crash.Capt Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots' Association of India, said: ""The AAIB report refers to a serviceability bulletin concerning the fuel control switch gates, which indicates a potential equipment malfunction. The tone and direction of the investigation suggest a bias toward pilot error. ALPA categorically rejects this presumption and insists on a fair, fact-based inquiry.""What is the possible technical issue? The AAIB report refers to the 'Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33' issued by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in Dec 2018. The bulletin is about the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. The bulletin was issued after reports came in from operators of Boeing 737s that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged.The said fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models, including the B787, the aircraft that crashed.The FAA recommended: ""Inspect the locking feature of the fuel control switch to ensure its engagement. While the airplane is on the ground, check whether the fuel control switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting up the switch. If the switch can be moved without lifting it up, the locking feature has been disengaged and the switch should be replaced at the earliest opportunity.""The AAIB report said: ""The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant an airworthiness directive (AD) by FAA. As per information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory.""",Preliminary report of aircraft accident investigation bureau (aaib) into the june 12 air india flight 171 crash in ahmedabad refers to a serviceability bulletin on the boeing-787's fuel control switch.

Friendship on ice: Taylor Swift and Blake Lively ’s once-close bond crumbles

Blake Lively reportedly blames Justin Baldoni—and has a new strategy

It seems not even Taylor Swift ’s most cherished friendships are safe from Hollywood drama. According to insiders, the pop icon has gone radio silent on her longtime best friend Blake Lively—and the catalyst may be actor-director Justin Baldoni. But with Swift’s focus shifting more toward Travis Kelce and her carefully curated inner circle, fans are questioning if the rift is beyond repair...For years, Blake Lively was part of Taylor Swift’s elite inner circle—frequently appearing in behind-the-scenes snaps, attending birthday parties, and even lending her children’s names to Swift’s music. But sources say the two haven't been on speaking terms since Lively’s connection to Baldoni’s It Ends With Us legal drama unexpectedly dragged Swift into the spotlight.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out,” one insider revealed. “There is no recovering from this. Their friendship is done.”Fans quickly noticed the silence when Blake Lively failed to like or acknowledge Taylor Swift’s celebratory post about reclaiming her music rights—a moment typically met with enthusiastic support from her tight-knit group. Swift, known for being fiercely loyal, apparently took Blake’s perceived alignment with Baldoni personally.Behind the scenes, Blake Lively is said to be frustrated that her public image took a hit due to Baldoni’s legal team’s aggressive tactics. “Blake’s image took a huge hit with all the mud that Justin and his legal team threw at her, she lost her best friend,” a source explained.And now, with Swift's world increasingly dominated by her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce, it’s clear who has her attention these days. The tight end has become a steady presence in Swift’s whirlwind life, traveling across continents to be by her side. Some insiders believe Swift has re-centered her personal world, pushing out friendships that no longer serve or align with her evolving brand.Still, Blake Lively reportedly isn’t staying quiet. “She’s also looking to build up more high-profile bonds so she can show Taylor she is still a Hollywood heavyweight—and part of that is bitter,” another source added.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s masters win went viral with Jack Antonoff and her cat Meredith—but Travis Kelce quietly made it unforgettable As Swift gears up for another leg of the Eras Tour and Kelce preps for his next NFL season, one thing is certain: there may no longer be space in their storybook romance for past dragons.","Taylor swift and blake lively's friendship appears to have fractured.

Meet the Poker tycoon hosting the star-studded Yacht parties with Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara



While gossip columns have been buzzing with speculation about a rumored romance between Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara, a much more intriguing story has quietly emerged behind the glittering backdrop of luxury yacht parties. The true star of this summer’s most talked-about celebrity gatherings is a man far from the Hollywood spotlight—billionaire entrepreneur Mark Scheinberg.As reported by TMZ, these lavish yacht parties, which have drawn A-listers from across sports, entertainment, and the influencer world, are being orchestrated by none other than Scheinberg, the Israeli-Canadian businessman best known for co-founding PokerStars. “Our sources say it's Israeli-Canadian businessman billionaire Mark Scheinberg's personal floating palace -- and he’s the one treating his famous friends to sun, surf, champagne . .. and some sexy fun,” the outlet revealed.For those unfamiliar with the name, Mark Scheinberg launched PokerStars with his father in 2001. The platform quickly dominated the online poker industry, turning into a global behemoth and eventually selling for a staggering $4.9 billion in 2014.Not one to rest on his laurels, Scheinberg shifted focus to hospitality, founding Mohari Hospitality, which invests in ultra-luxurious properties around the world.Today, he lives on the Isle of Man and boasts an estimated net worth of $5.6 to $6 billion. But Scheinberg’s fortune isn’t just fueling wild parties. Through the Scheinberg Relief Fund, his family has been actively supporting global charities and wildlife preservation efforts.Still, it’s his newfound role as the unofficial “host of the summer” that has raised eyebrows—and curiosity. His opulent private yacht has become the center of some of the most exclusive gatherings of the season. From NFL stars like Brady to Hollywood elites like Vergara, his guest list reads like a who’s who of celebrity culture.But Scheinberg isn’t handling these social affairs solo. Assisting him is longtime friend Doug Chabbott, who helps coordinate the guest lists. However, TMZ noted, “One source claims not every celebrity has said yes to their invitation. They've been turned down by some stars who thought it was odd being they didn't know Mark or Doug.”As for Sofia Vergara, while some speculated a budding romance, insiders insist, “Doug’s been linked to her in the past, but we’re told it’s all just friendly fun and nothing romantic.”So while the headlines focused on Tom Brady and Vergara, the real story is the billionaire poker mogul turning heads with his secretive, star-studded floating paradise—proof that sometimes, the most fascinating people are the ones you’ve never heard of.Also Read: ""At the end of the day..."": Patrick Mahomes does not mind being snubbed at NFL top 100, his main goal is something else","Poker tycoon mark scheinberg is the man behind the star-studded yacht parties.

Terry Bradshaw slams Steelers for trading Kenny Pickett, ignoring offensive line, and failing their first-round QB

Terry Bradshaw’s unapologetic critique of the Pittsburgh Steelers’ direction

NFL legend Terry Bradshaw isn’t exactly known for pulling punches, and this offseason he’s at it again—taking aim squarely at his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bradshaw believes the organization badly mishandled young quarterback Kenny Pickett, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, calling the decision to give up on him after just two seasons a prime example of systemic failure. In recent podcasts and interviews, he’s aired his frustration about Pittsburgh’s roster decisions, their treatment of Pickett, and even floated some biting takes about rumored replacements like Aaron Rodgers . When Bradshaw talks about quarterbacks, everyone listens—even if it ruffles some feathers.On a recent podcast this week (July 2025), Terry Bradshaw didn’t mince words describing how Pittsburgh jettisoned Kenny Pickett after just two seasons.“A first-rounder, got rid of him after two years,” Bradshaw said. “And they're still looking for a quarterback. They didn't even do anything to build around him.”That’s not the first time he’s sounded the alarm. Earlier this year, speaking with ESPN, Bradshaw made clear he thought the trade was a massive blunder.“I liked Kenny Pickett,” he said. “I liked him at Pitt. I know him. I know what he's like.”Bradshaw argues Pittsburgh never gave Pickett a real shot to succeed.“When they got him to Pittsburgh, they didn't protect him, they didn't get him an offensive line,” Bradshaw explained. “They wanted to run the football, but they didn't have an offensive line that could protect, and they didn't have weapons. He had no wide receivers to speak of.”He points out the irony that the Steelers finally invested in the offensive line after shipping Pickett to Philadelphia.“They throw a kid in there for two years, and you've got an offense that doesn't fit and doesn't work, and they can't run because their offensive line's not even good enough for a run-blocking team,” Bradshaw said. “Now, they're saying Kenny Pickett is a failure. He wasn't a failure. The Steelers were a failure.”When Pickett left Pittsburgh, he’d posted a 14-10 record as a starter, with 4,474 yards, 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Meanwhile, backup Mason Rudolph stepped in and delivered a three-game win streak that secured a playoff spot—prompting the Steelers to move on from their former first-rounder.Pickett will now compete for the starting job with the Cleveland Browns this season, while Rudolph’s future in Pittsburgh remains uncertain.Bradshaw also didn’t hold back on another rumor swirling around Pittsburgh this offseason: the idea they’d sign Aaron Rodgers to be their next starter. He dismissed the idea as a “joke.” As for Bradshaw’s opinions? Love them or hate them, they’re hard to ignore. When Terry Bradshaw talks quarterbacks, he doesn’t sugarcoat it—and the Steelers might be wise to listen next time.Also Read: Jaylen Warren’s bold offseason overhaul could make him the Pittsburgh Steelers’ surprise RB1 in 2025","Terry bradshaw believes the pittsburgh steelers mishandled young quarterback kenny pickett.

In a bold and aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore). Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:Industry insiders say this is only the beginning. Meta is reportedly in talks with several more prominent figures in AI research and robotics, indicating further expansions to the Superintelligence Lab.

Surrey mayor Brenda Locke was slammed after she issued a message following the recent firing at Indian celebrity Kapil Sharma's recently opened cafe in her area, for which Harjit Singh Laddi, an operative of the banned Babbar Khalsa International, claimed responsibility. The message cracked down on social media platforms for circulating the video of the incident.""A recent shooting at a local business was brazenly filmed and posted online by an individual claiming responsibility. This act was meant not only to harm its direct victim but to terrorize our whole community,"" the mayor said.""It is intolerable that legitimate news content is blocked on some social media platforms while videos glorifying violent crime circulate freely.""""That’s why I am calling on Meta, X, TikTok, and other social platforms to stop allowing violent criminals to weaponize your networks against the people of Surrey.""""I felt the community's fear first-hand last night while visiting Kap’s Cafe and nearby businesses and speaking with employees and customers who now worry about their safety.""""We will not let criminals dictate how we live or work. I am confident that, together, we will keep Surrey safe, resilient, and unafraid,"" the message said.The post on social media came under intense criticism as users told her to tackle the gangster issue and not blame X for failing to maintain law and order.""Weird take!! Focus on the crime, not the videos. The damage is done,"" one wrote.""Mirror, mirror on the wall. Isn't she the dumbest of em all?

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","Youtube will ban channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N nvidia finished trading on july 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion.

A post on X went viral as it revealed how H-1B visa program is not just a scam happening with US workers but also an exploration of foreign workers who would do anything to stay in the US. H1-B visa programs allow US companies to hire skilled employees from foreign countries and it has remained a contentious issue as the US job market is shrinking though companies are not reducing H-1B hiring.The person in the viral post claimed that he had an H-1B peer from India, who was a nice and competent person who was getting burnt out under the work pressure at the US company where they were working.
