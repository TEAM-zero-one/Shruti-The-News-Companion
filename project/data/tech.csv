Jameis Winston closing in on Giants deal— what it means for Aaron Rodgers and the NFC East race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jameis-winston-closing-in-on-giants-deal-what-it-means-for-aaron-rodgers-and-the-nfc-east-race/articleshow/119326798.cms,"Credit: Imagn Images

Jameis Winston joins the New York Giants: What it means for the Quarterback room



What Winston brings to the Giants



What this means for Aaron Rodgers and the Giants



The New York Giants have made a significant move at the quarterback position, though it may not be the one many anticipated. The team has secured the services of veteran quarterback Jameis Winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million, as reported by NFL Media. Winston himself confirmed the signing on social media, signaling a fresh chapter in his career with Big Blue. However, the signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the Giants' long-term plans at quarterback and how this impacts their potential pursuit of Aaron Rodgers.While adding Winston provides the Giants with much-needed experience under center, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks. NFL Media has indicated that New York remains open to acquiring additional talent, whether through free agency—where Rodgers is still available—or via the upcoming NFL Draft, where Shedeur Sanders is a strong candidate for the No. 3 overall pick.If the Giants do decide to draft a quarterback, Winston could serve as a transitional figure, helping to mentor a rookie and providing a stabilizing presence as they adjust to the NFL. This signing also reflects the Giants' ongoing search for a veteran signal-caller after missing out on other targets, such as Matthew Stafford, who opted to stay with the Los Angeles Rams.Despite Winston’s experience, his contract suggests that he is not necessarily being viewed as the long-term solution. At $8 million over two years, the financial commitment is relatively modest, positioning him more as a bridge quarterback rather than the definitive starter. Before this signing, Tommy DeVito was the only quarterback on the Giants’ roster, highlighting the team’s urgent need for additional depth at the position.Winston, 31, brings a wealth of experience to the Giants' locker room. Having entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in 2015 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he has started 87 regular-season games throughout his career. His career statistics include 24,225 passing yards, 154 touchdowns, and 111 interceptions, with an 86.4 passer rating. Last season, Winston made seven starts for the Cleveland Browns, where he completed 61.1% of his passes for 2,121 yards, throwing 13 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.His experience as a starter makes him a viable short-term option for the Giants, particularly if they draft a young quarterback. While he may not possess the same ceiling as elite quarterbacks, his presence ensures the team has a competent signal-caller who can step in and lead the offense if needed.The timing of Winston’s signing is particularly interesting, as it coincided with Aaron Rodgers’ visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Giants have long been rumored as a potential destination for Rodgers, and some speculated that bringing in Winston might signal a shift away from those plans. However, according to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Winston’s signing does not affect the Giants' pursuit of Rodgers. ""Winston is nothing more than a veteran for the QB room,"" Breer reported, emphasizing that the team’s interest in Rodgers remains unchanged.Rodgers, who remains the highest-profile quarterback on the free-agent market, left his visit with the Steelers without a deal. That leaves open the possibility that New York could still make a push for him. If the Giants were to sign Rodgers, it would likely alter their draft strategy, making it less urgent to select a quarterback early.Alternatively, if the Giants opt not to sign Rodgers, Winston could hold the starting job temporarily while a rookie quarterback develops. This approach aligns with how other teams have managed young signal-callers, easing them into the starting role rather than throwing them into the fire immediately.The signing of Jameis Winston provides the New York Giants with a veteran presence at quarterback, but it does not offer a definitive answer to the team’s long-term plans. While Winston is a capable starter with extensive experience, his arrival does not rule out the possibility of adding another quarterback, either through free agency or the draft.Also Read: ""Because I caught it early, we were able to treat it”: Erin Andrews encourages regular doctor visits after cervical cancer battle With Rodgers still available and the Giants holding the No. 3 pick in the upcoming draft, the quarterback landscape in New York remains fluid. Whether Winston ultimately becomes the starter or serves as a mentor for a young quarterback, his presence ensures that the Giants are better prepared at the position heading into the 2025 season. However, until Rodgers makes a decision or the Giants finalize their draft-day plans, the question remains: who will be leading the team under center when the season kicks off?","The new york giants have signed veteran quarterback jameis winston on a two-year deal worth $8 million. The signing raises more questions than answers, particularly regarding the giants' long-term plans at quarterback. While adding winston provides the giants with much-needed experience, it does not necessarily take them out of the running for other quarterbacks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119326774,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Although he wasn't responsible for introducing her to Prince Harry , he facilitated their relationship by arranging private meetings at Soho House and coordinating a visit to Babington House in Somerset.Their close relationship was evident through his attendance at her royal wedding and her previous blog posts on The Tig, where she referred to him as ""my loving, supportive, and endlessly fun friend"". Despite other friends such as Abigail Spencer and Delfina Blaquier appearing in With Love, Meghan, Anderson was conspicuously absent. Their last public sighting together was at a friend's baby shower in December.The Daily Mail reported that Anderson's absence from the show is attributed to his extensive business travel commitments.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.

MUMBAI: Sebi chief Tuhin Kanta Pandey said Saturday there was no need to change taxation laws for foreign portfolio investors as India has delivered double-digit returns in dollar terms and policy certainty is essential. Pandey emphasised Sebi's focus on trust, transparency, and technology while highlighting the need for balanced regulation. He said Sebi would continue taking action against corporates for misleading disclosures, as flagged by its surveillance systems.In a chat with a news channel, the Sebi chief said the regulator has evolved under successive leadership and benefits from a strong institutional framework. ""I believe we have one of the best capital market infrastructures in the world.

India's startup count to double by 2030: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-startup-count-to-double-by-2030-study/articleshow/119318697.cms,"BENGALURU: India's startup ecosystem is set for rapid expansion, with the number of startups projected to double from 120,000 in 2023 to 240,000 by 2030, according to a new report by executive search firm Longhouse, shared exclusively with TOI.This growth is expected to drive a surge in high-value enterprises, with the number of unicorns-startups valued at over $1 billion-rising from 120 currently to 280 by the end of the decade. The expansion is also poised to have a significant impact on employment, with startups contributing to both direct and indirect job creation across key sectors..The report added the startup ecosystem is projected to create 50 million jobs by 2030, with startups driving a surge in both direct employment and the gig economy. Of these, 4-5 million will be direct white-collar jobs, another 9-10 million in the gig economy, and 35-40 million indirect jobs across sectors. ""A significant portion of these jobs will emerge from newer startups rather than just expansion in existing companies. As India moves from 120 unicorns today to an expected 280 by 2030, most of the employment growth will come from companies that are scaling up rapidly in emerging sectors like AI, SaaS, clean tech, and fintech,"" Rohit Srivastava, senior partner, Longhouse said.The report also highlighted a fundamental shift in the startup founder demographic. Between 2020 and 2024, 40% of unicorn founders had 10-15 years of prior work experience, up from 26% in the 2008-2013 period. Additionally, 55% of unicorn founders held leadership roles before launching their ventures, underscoring the increasing role of domain expertise and industry networks in creating a successful business.The share of unicorn founders with over 20 years of experience also peaked at 30% in recent years, signalling a move towards seasoned entrepreneurs replacing the younger, early-stage founders who once dominated India's startup boom.""Founders today are entering entrepreneurship with deeper industry expertise. The days of fresh-out-of-college unicorn builder are giving way to more seasoned cohort,"" Srivastava added.The study pointed to key industry trends shaping the future of startup landscape. While fintech and enterprise tech continue to dominate the list, AI-led innovation, deeptech, and sustainability-focused startups are gaining investor interest. AI is expected to drive growth across sectors, not only through new startups but also by transforming existing businesses. SaaS is emerging as a strong contender, with more Indian startups scaling into global markets.""AI is both job creator and disruptor. While automation may replace certain routine jobs, it is opening new opportunities in AI development, enterprise transformation, and specialised services.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Ben & jerry's accuses its parent company, unilever, of unlawfully removing its ceo.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline indigo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Google parent Alphabet agreed to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent.Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision.Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.The Wiz takeover is by far the largest M&A deal to be announced this year. Deal hungry companies and their advisers had initially predicted that US President Donald Trump’s policies would create better conditions for buying and selling, supercharging an M&A market that just got back on its feet after a lull. Instead, his tariff threats and geopolitical tensions have spooked markets and kept dealmakers in wait-and-see mode.Google framed the Wiz ac quisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of Artificial Intelligence.“AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call with investors. “Organisations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds.”","Wiz will join the google cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said.

Solana meme coins , once the stars of 2024, have seen their market caps decline in recent months. However, one standout project is defying the trend. Solaxy ’s crypto presale is rapidly approaching the $30 million mark, undeterred by the broader market downturn.Unlike typical meme coins, Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem with its ambitious layer-2 scaling solution .The Solana meme coin market has been quiet for a while now. The tokens that captured massive attention in 2024 are losing value.BONK, for example, has seen a steep 45% drop on the monthly chart. From one of last year’s hottest tokens, it is at risk of being another forgetful meme coin.But it’s not just the Solana meme coin market that is suffering. Significant members of the market like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen a sharp decline. The overall crypto market is in a downtrend, with Bitcoin slipping under $90,000. On top of that, Solana’s frequent congestion issues are driving users and developers away. While the network was a hot hub for meme coins in 2024, its rising transaction fees and slow processing times are making it less attractive for new projects. Solaxy brings real utility to the Solana network. It is developing Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution.The project’s goal is to address the blockchain’s congestion issues head-on by processing transactions off-chain. After that, they are batched for final verification.The mechanism could significantly reduce the strain on Solana’s mainnet by lowering transaction fees and expediting processing speeds.Even during peak trading hours, Solaxy could help keep the network frictionless.Beyond scalability, Solaxy has bigger ambitions. According to its white paper, the project plans to introduce cross-chain functionality between Solana and Ethereum.In other words, it is not just another scaling tool. It has the potential to bridge major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking opportunities in NFTs , gaming, and DeFi.Solaxy’s growing popularity indicates that investors are ready to back innovative projects despite the bearish market. Influential crypto voices like Austin Hilton have taken notice of the project, highlighting its core features.Even as the broader market struggles, Solaxy is gaining strong momentum.Solaxy is currently priced at just $0.001648, while Solana is selling for $130. The price difference presents a significant upside for early investors.While Solana has a $65 billion market cap, Solaxy’s starting valuation leaves substantial room for potential growth. The presale price is a major attraction for early investors.The incentives don’t stop there. Early adopters can benefit from Solaxy’s passive rewards program. It allows investors to earn by locking their tokens. Solaxy’s current annual percentage yield (APY) stands at around 150%, presenting an opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. More than 6.5 billion tokens have been locked into the protocol so far. With 25% of the supply set aside for community rewards, the team shows commitment to stability. The strategy could reduce early-stage sell-offs and lay a robust path for growth.Security is another factor working in Solaxy’s favour. A thorough audit by Coinsult has verified that the project has no vulnerabilities. The full audit report is available on Solaxy’s website. The transparency offers reassurance to investors.With the $30 million milestone close, the window of opportunity to join the crypto presale is closing fast. Investors can join the presale using either cryptocurrencies or bank cards.To streamline the process, Solaxy has partnered with Best Wallet. The presale is also compatible with popular Web3 wallets like MetaMask. Participation is simple for both seasoned and first-time investors.A clear roadmap is laid out for the project’s journey ahead, with 30% of funds allocated to project development and 25% going to community rewards. 15% will be used for marketing initiatives, while 10% will be allocated for liquidity. And 20% will be held in the treasury.Solaxy is building a large community on social media platforms too, with its official X (Twitter) account already amassing 70,000 followers.Name: SolaxyEmail: Help@solaxy.com*You must be at least 18 years old to access this site.","Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the solana ecosystem.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
