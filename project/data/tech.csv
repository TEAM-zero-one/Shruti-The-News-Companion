When Carnatic vocalist Bombay Jayashri Ramnath suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2023, the singer was unable to sit, stand, or move. Involuntary neck and jaw tremors made even speech, an uphill task, forget singing. Traditional physiotherapy, with its repetitive routines, felt painful, monotonous and dispiriting. Recovery seemed distant, and she shut herself from social circles. Then came Jerry — not a real person, but a lively, animated coach inside a virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation program.In one of the games, “Save the Jerry”, set on a sunlit beach, the avatar nudged her to stand up and walk. Through immersive sessions, each small motion made Jerry dance and cheer, turning therapy into play. Other games targeted different challenges — like restoring neck mobility, controlling her left shoulder, or helping her relax and reduce involuntary movements. They were set in storylines featuring forests and snowy mountains, where she rescued birds and gathered fruit for penguins, or prayed peacefully at a temple.“I looked forward to these sessions. Recovery became less about gruelling effort. It was about play, progress, and hope,” said the 60-year-old singer, who has sung in multiple languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, and English.A year later, in Dec 2024, Jayashri, the fourth generation of artistes in her family and trained by legends like Lalgudi Jayaraman and T R Balamani, stood on stage once again, this time to receive the Music Academy’s Sangita Kalanidhi award. “I haven’t done a fullfledged concert yet. But I’ve begun recording again. It may not be this Dec, but I plan to restart my kutcheries (Carnatic concerts) soon,” she said.After undergoing brain surgery in the UK, Jayashri returned to India for therapy. She chose to continue most of her physiotherapy at home. The immersive VR program tapped into neuroplasticity, helping her brain rebuild damaged motor pathways through visual and emotional feedback. “It was slow, but I gradually regained strength, coordination, and confidence. These sessions even encouraged me to perform better in speech therapy, too,” she said.While her therapy included the usual mix of physiotherapy and speech exercises, her therapists gradually increased the time spent on digitally prescribed routines to match her progress. Her physiotherapist, Raja from ReWin, a company using digital therapeutics to enhance rehabilitation, said that unlike conventional physiotherapy, the system integrates a wearable motion sensor that tracks joint movement with precision, eliminating human error.“It also gives us quick, repeatable measurements to monitor progress. Combining this technology with immersive VR creates a powerful tool for lower-limb and gait rehabilitation, allowing patients to visualise and experience leg movements for strengthening neuromuscular pathways,” he added.Physiotherapists point to research showing that engaging in virtual tasks stimulates dopamine release, enhancing motivation and speeding up neural recovery. Dopamine plays a key role in motor memory formation and motivation pathways, which means patients train more effectively and recover faster from neurological injuries. VR and gaming-style immersive tasks activate dopamine-driven reward circuits, improving motor and cognitive outcomes.Digital exercises also allow room for creativity. In one instance, a 66-year-old woman with a frozen shoulder was taken on a virtual journey to the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi. Her therapy involved reaching out to offer digital flowers and rotating her hands during a virtual aarti. These movements were designed to mirror the stretches she needed for recovery, without drawing her attention to the pain. After just one session, she said she felt so much better.“Places of worship are very popular with my patients with Parkinson’s and dementia,” said senior orthopaedic surgeon Dr Thineshchandar Andiappan. “It helps them regain a wide range of hand movements.”Digital exercise prescriptions also ensure continuity of care through remote monitoring, progress tracking and consistent engagement. This is why hospitals and rehabilitation centres are increasingly integrating them into postsurgical routines. Dr Andiappan began briefly using the system a year ago, but has steadily increased its use.“Now patients do about half an hour of digital exercises along with traditional ones. Earlier, it was just 15 minutes of digital and 45 minutes of traditional,” he said. The digital format, he added, improves adherence, affordability and accessibility. “Quality of life improves for most patients. The sensors alert them when movements are incorrect or the range is insufficient. They can correct themselves in real time. ”At least two govt hospitals in Chennai — the Government Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and the National Institute of Ageing — now combine traditional and digital therapy. “We cannot replace traditional exercises. They supplement traditional exercises well. We track patient movement range and make timely corrections, improving outcomes,” said physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist Dr P Thirunavukkarasu. In the private sector, several companies are offering portable, interactive systems for home use, complete with real-time feedback and guided routines — bringing a new dimension to rehabilitation outside the clinic.| Bio-engineers and physiotherapists, using inputs from doctors.

Cardi B Turns Her Umbilical Cord Into GOLD!

Stefon Diggs’ girlfriend Cardi B commemorates fourth baby’s birth with unique heart-shaped gold jewelry

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins. The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules. The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the attraction of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.",The grammy-winning rapper entrusted mommy made encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

Why Russell Wilson is the friend who wants all the tea



Ciara, Kelly Rowland & Lala Anthony: Red Flags, Signature Scents & Friendship | Level Up Radio

For Ciara and her circle of close friends, group chats are never dull, especially when Russell Wilson decides to show up in the middle of the discussion. The Giants quarterback often finds himself at the center of their conversations, not because he tries to lead them, but because he cannot resist joining in. On the latest episode of Apple Music’s Level Up Radio, Ciara sat with Kelly Rowland and La La Anthony and the trio let listeners in on what really happens behind the scenes. Their stories painted a lively picture of Wilson, who often slips into the chat with genuine curiosity and a sense of humor that keeps everyone entertained.The women shared lighthearted moments that revealed the quarterback’s playful and thoughtful side. Even as Wilson works through a difficult stretch in his NFL journey, it is clear that his role within Ciara’s trusted circle is as strong as ever. Their conversations showed how he blends fun with honest advice, something all three women value.Kelly Rowland set the tone by declaring, “Russ is nosy,” a comment that caused the group to burst into laughter. La La Anthony quickly backed her up, adding, “He’s all in my business.” According to them, Wilson will not hesitate to jump into a discussion with a direct question that catches everyone off guard. Rowland joked, “He will come in the middle of the conversation and [Ciara] is like, ‘Russ Russ Russ,’ and he just outright asks.Even with all the teasing, their remarks came from a place of affection. Anthony said she values Wilson’s honesty, especially when she needs guidance. “I love his input because sometimes you do need the male perspective. And he’s another one, he will check me,” she said. “He’ll be like, ‘Sis, this is what you’re doing wrong.’”Ciara agreed and explained how the dynamic works for all of them. “We always hold the girls down… Y’all have your own thing with Russ, so my point is if there is something that is love-related, not deep, I’ll be like, ‘Baby, we gotta check on our friends,’” she said. Anthony added that Ciara creates the space for boundaries, saying, “For me, you give me the space to share with him whatever I choose or whatever I don’t choose to share with him. ”Their bond continues even while Wilson navigates the ups and downs of his 14th NFL season. After being benched earlier this year, he remained committed to the team, saying, “I’m not done. I’ve got so much belief in myself and know what I can be capable of.” He followed that with another clear message of loyalty. “I want to be here. I love this organization. I love the guys in the locker room. I’m not giving up on us in this season,” he said.Through uncertainty, one thing stays steady. He is still the guy in the group chat who wants the tea, offers the truth, and brings everyone closer with his presence.Also Read: Brandon Aiyuk’s 49ers future hits shocking crossroads as contract concerns and injury fears spark exit whispers","Ciara reveals russell wilson’s surprising habit of getting ‘nosy’ and digging for gossip around her famous friends.

Fans long envisioned Swift as the music-powered mutant, citing her stage presence and pop icon status. While Carpenter offers a fresh take, Swift's connection to Dazzler remains a captivating 'what if' for many.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Taylor Swift’s name refuses to leave the Dazzler conversation





Pop culture fans are buzzing again and this time, Taylor Swift is right at the center of the conversation. Fresh reports suggesting Sabrina Carpenter has met with Marvel Studios about joining the MCU as Dazzler have reopened a debate that has been simmering for years: should Swift have been the one to bring the glittering, music-powered mutant to life?With Marvel’s long-anticipated X-Men reboot finally gaining shape, the resurfaced rumors feel less like idle chatter and more like a missed opportunity for Swifties who believed their superstar was destined for the role. Carpenter’s rising momentum makes her a natural fit, but the fascination with Swift as Dazzler remains unmatched, fueled by her global visibility, magnetic stage presence, and long-rumored connection to the character.Even as Sabrina Carpenter earns attention for reportedly stepping into Marvel’s orbit, Taylor Swift’s shadow looms large. The idea of Swift playing Dazzler became a fan obsession years ago, especially after Easter egg–hungry Marvel watchers connected her iconic pop persona to Alison Blaire’s disco-era flair.Swift has long embodied the kind of larger-than-life musical identity that made Dazzler more than just another mutant, she’s an entertainer first, a reluctant hero second. That duality mirrors Swift’s own evolution from country singer to global phenomenon, someone who commands stadiums yet fiercely protects her creative autonomy.The speculation only intensified after Swift appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine fan theories, with many convinced she would make a surprise MCU cameo.Although it never materialized, it showed how deeply fans associated the character with her. Dazzler’s signature ability, turning sound into shimmering bursts of light, felt almost too on-the-nose for Swift, whose concerts are already a choreographed explosion of music, color, and emotion.Carpenter, meanwhile, represents a newer generation of pop stardom, and her growing influence aligns neatly with Marvel’s push to refresh the X-Men for a modern audience. Her charm and performance style would certainly bring a youthful electricity to Alison Blaire. But Swift’s potential casting would have carried a sense of pop-culture inevitability, the merging of two massive fandoms at a pivotal moment in Marvel’s rebuilding era.If Carpenter does land the role, it will mark a major milestone in her career. Yet for many fans, the conversation will always return to Swift, because some MCU “what ifs” are simply too dazzling to forget.Also Read: “She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce","Pop culture is abuzz as sabrina carpenter reportedly meets with marvel for the dazzler role, reigniting debate over taylor swift's potential casting.

Cloud computing shift offers blueprint for Microsoft's AI transformation





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella fears repeating old mistakes





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes the company needs to completely rethink its business model for the artificial intelligence era, turning to an executive who influenced Microsoft's cloud computing transformation 15 years ago to help navigate what he describes as a critical platform shift that could determine the tech giant's survival. Nadella appointed Rolf Harms as an advisor on AI economics, the same executive whose 2010 white paper ""Economics of the Cloud"" helped force a cultural reckoning at Microsoft and paved the way for its cloud success. In an early November memo to top Microsoft executives obtained by Business Insider, Nadella wrote that the company needs to ""rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company — just as we once did with the cloud"".""This platform shift is all about building a new AI factory and family of Copilots and agents that drive diffusion and usage across the full stack,"" Nadella wrote in the memo. The move comes as AI companies face mounting questions over whether massive infrastructure investments will pay off. Microsoft took its foot off the AI spending pedal earlier this year, helping to stoke these concerns, though the company has recently doubled down through major new deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.Harms' 2010 white paper was considered a watershed moment in cloud computing, helping make the case for Microsoft's investments by showing why customers would eventually use large-scale cloud services to save money despite concerns about security and availability. At the time, people at Microsoft complained to Harms that he was ""throwing bombshells into their org,"" to which he responded: ""they're already there, I'm just helping you find them"".In a July 2025 letter to employees, Nadella acknowledged the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of thriving by objective measures while undergoing layoffs, calling it ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value"". He emphasized the need to meet changing customer needs by maintaining current business while creating new categories with new business models.The urgency reflects deeper concerns about Microsoft's long-term survival. At a September town hall, Nadella told employees he is ""haunted"" by Digital Equipment Corporation, which once ruled minicomputers but disappeared after making strategic errors. The Verge reported that Nadella warned ""some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward"".Harms will continue reporting to Cloud + AI boss Scott Guthrie while working closely with Nadella and top executives, advising them on adapting to AI's new economics, from infrastructure to platform technology and applications. In his annual letter, Nadella reframed Microsoft's mission from building a ""software factory"" to becoming an ""intelligence engine"" that empowers everyone to create their own tools.Microsoft declined to comment when asked about the memo.Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed the company is shifting from charging ""per user"" to ""per agent"" as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast"", Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said: “Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work. The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella appointed rolf harms as an advisor on ai economics.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock, drawing parallels to chip manufacturer Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Replaying to the question of a user on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk gave an answer on Telsa’s meteoric rise. A user on X recently asked the Tesla CEO that when will Tesla experience its own ‘Nvidia moment’. Replying to the user, Musk said that the company’s breakthrough moment will come with unsupervised self-driving at scale and, even more significantly, with the mass production of its Optimus humanoid robot.Elon Musk stressed on the fact that valuation of Tesla will witness a shift once its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology achieves widespread deployment without any human intervention. He also defended Tesla’s relativity modest AI training spend. Musk noted that the company’s vehicles can generate vast amount of real-world driving data which is used to refine the system.Former Tesla AI chief Andrej Karpathy recently praised the FSD system, describing a drive in his HW4 Model X as “basically flawless” and likening it to riding a magnetic levitation train.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Optimus the humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus is Tesla’s future growth engine. He feels that Optimus will represent more than 80% of Tesla’s long-term value. Along with this, he also made some sweeping predictions about the potential of Optimus. Musk said that Optimus could:* Help countries like Japan address labor shortages* “Eliminate poverty” and enable universal income* Even serve as an “incredible surgeon”, providing advanced medical care universallyMusk has gone so far as to call Optimus an “infinite money glitch”, underscoring his belief in its transformative economic impact.The comments made by Musk comes at a time when Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market value overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has projected $500 billion in revenue, calling it unprecedented visibility for a technology company.

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”",Jensen huang’s talks about transformative shifts driving ai growth. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of ai infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125456676,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41264,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
"Verizon layoffs: America’s largest telecom company to cut 13,000 jobs, what CEO Dan Schulman said in internal memo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-americas-largest-telecom-company-to-cut-13000-jobs-what-ceo-dan-schulman-said-in-internal-memo/articleshow/125465746.cms,"Verizon layoffs 2025

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Warren Buffett’s $4.3 billion Alphabet investment signals a direct challenge to Nvidia’s lead in AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warren-buffetts-4-3-billion-alphabet-investment-signals-a-direct-challenge-to-nvidias-lead-in-ai-chips/articleshow/125506567.cms,"Google’s AI chips may be shifting the balance of power

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A shifting competitive dynamic, but not a dethroning

Google trains and serves Gemini models on TPU infrastructure.

Google Cloud is offering Ironwood TPUs to customers as part of its cloud platform.

Companies such as Anthropic have announced plans to use up to one million Google TPUs, citing performance and cost considerations.

What Buffett’s investment likely signals

Implications for the AI chip race





When Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, most observers initially viewed it as another major addition to Warren Buffett’s long-term portfolio. Yet the timing and strategic context suggest the investment could be more than a routine allocation. The world’s most influential value investor has chosen to back Alphabet at a moment when the company is strengthening its control over the hardware that underpins advanced AI systems.For nearly a decade, Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU, describing it as designed for demanding AI workloads, including large-scale model training and high-volume inference. This announcement was made publicly on Google Cloud’s official blog, where the company highlighted lower costs and improved performance for AI developers.Most AI labs still rely heavily on Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs.These GPUs remain the industry’s gold standard, but they are extremely expensive and often in short supply. This has created bottlenecks for AI companies that depend entirely on Nvidia for compute capacity.Google is in a unique position. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match without years of hardware investment. Analysts and industry researchers have suggested that TPU-based training may offer meaningful cost advantages compared to traditional GPU-heavy infrastructure, although exact ratios vary and are not always publicly disclosed.Buffett’s investment therefore can be understood not as a claim that Alphabet has overtaken Nvidia, but as confidence in Alphabet’s vertically integrated approach to AI. By controlling more of the stack, Alphabet potentially insulates itself from the price swings, supply constraints and dependence that characterise the GPU market.Nvidia remains the clear leader in AI chips and maintains a robust ecosystem of developers, tools and software support. Google’s TPUs represent a serious alternative in some workloads, but not a full replacement for GPUs across all use cases.The publicly available evidence shows:These developments suggest that the AI compute market may become more competitive. However, they do not confirm that Nvidia’s dominance is definitively weakened. Instead, they indicate that Alphabet is emerging as a strong hardware contender in a market previously dominated by a single supplier.Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosed stake in Alphabet was valued at approximately US$4.3 billion at the time of the filing. The filing does not state Berkshire’s motives. However, investors and analysts widely agree that Buffett’s approval of such a large position indicates confidence in Alphabet’s long-term strategy, including its growing emphasis on efficient AI infrastructure.Buffett has consistently favoured companies with durable advantages or “moats.” Alphabet’s traditional moats have included Search, YouTube and Android. In the AI era, Google’s control over its own chip design and cloud hardware may represent an additional moat that differentiates it from rivals.This does not imply that Google is attempting to dismantle Nvidia’s leadership. Instead, it suggests that Alphabet is building the capability to operate more independently in an AI-driven future, and that this capability may strengthen its competitiveness in cloud computing and AI services.The next phase of AI is likely to be shaped by which companies can train and deploy models most efficiently. If Google Cloud attracts more third-party training due to cost, performance and availability, it could gradually shift cloud market dynamics. Nvidia will remain central to the ecosystem, but Google’s TPU ecosystem adds a new dimension to the competition.Buffett’s investment amplifies the narrative that companies with deeper control over hardware, software and data will hold significant advantages in the years ahead. Alphabet is signalling that it intends to be such a company.The takeaway is clear: this is not the end of Nvidia’s dominance, but it may be the beginning of a more competitive era in AI hardware.",Berkshire hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in alphabet.

Google has officially launched Nano Banana Pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular AI image generator. Powered by the newly introduced Gemini 3 model, this latest version brings enhanced reasoning, improved world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering. The update reflects a significant advancement in Google’s AI ecosystem, building on the success of the earlier Nano Banana tool that became a viral sensation on social media. Users can now generate higher-resolution images, adjust lighting, focus, and camera angles, and integrate real-time information from Google Search. Nano Banana Pro also supports multilingual text and consistent character visualisation, making it ideal for professional creators. The rollout coincides with rapid momentum across Google’s AI products and strong user growth on Gemini-powered platforms.Nano Banana Pro is based on the Gemini 3 Pro architecture, offering stronger reasoning capabilities, improved world knowledge, and more precise text rendering. The announcement of Gemini 3 earlier this week also led to a noticeable increase in Alphabet’s stock, reflecting growing market interest in Google’s expanding AI technologies.Josh Woodward, Vice President at Google Labs and Gemini, shared with CNBC that the new version far surpasses the original Nano Banana release from August. Internal testers have leveraged the tool for tasks such as transforming code snippets and resumes into polished infographics. Woodward added that users are discovering innovative ways to visualise information that previously resisted visual representation.The first Nano Banana tool, built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, became a viral sensation on social media, with users creating hyperrealistic mini figurines. This original version brought millions of new sign-ups to the Gemini app within days, highlighting the public appetite for creative AI tools.One of the standout upgrades in Nano Banana Pro is its enhanced text generation capabilities. The tool can retain original text within images, create new text in diverse styles, and even translate content across multiple languages. These improvements are particularly useful for graphic designers, marketers, and content creators, who can now use AI to produce posters, mockups, and other marketing visuals with highly accurate text.Nano Banana Pro supports image generation at 2K and 4K resolution, a significant increase from the original model’s 1024×1024 output. Users can now adjust camera angles, lighting, depth of field, focus, and colour grading, giving professionals creative control similar to tools like MidJourney. These upgrades make it possible to generate images that meet professional standards for clarity, composition, and artistic effect.A new feature allows Nano Banana Pro to connect with Google Search, enabling images to be generated from live information. For example, users can generate visuals for a recipe, create educational flashcards, or produce graphics based on current data. This integration expands the tool’s versatility beyond static prompts, making it ideal for dynamic content creation.The Pro version can blend up to fourteen objects or use six high-fidelity photos in a single composition. It also maintains consistent appearances for up to five people, which is particularly useful for creating storyboards, presentations, or character sequences. This feature ensures visual continuity across projects, enhancing workflow efficiency for professional creators.Google is rolling out Nano Banana Pro through multiple channels:While Nano Banana Pro produces higher-quality images, Google notes that it is more resource-intensive and slower than the original Nano Banana.To ensure responsible use, Google is expanding SynthID, its AI watermarking system, across Nano Banana Pro. All images generated or edited include invisible identifiers, allowing users to verify whether a visual was created using Google AI and helping combat misinformation or misuse. Free and Pro-tier users will also see a visible sparkle watermark on generated images. Ultra subscribers have the option to remove visible watermarks, providing a clean canvas for professional projects, creative presentations, and other commercial or personal uses while maintaining accountability.Using Nano Banana Pro is straightforward:Free users are limited in the number of generations before the app switches back to the original Nano Banana model.The original Nano Banana runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash, while Nano Banana Pro is powered by Gemini 3. This gives the Pro version stronger reasoning, better world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering, enabling more complex and precise image generation.Original Nano Banana supports lower resolutions (around 1024×1024), whereas Pro can generate images at 2K and 4K. The Pro version also allows advanced adjustments like lighting, depth of field, focus, color grading, and camera angles, giving creators near-professional control.Pro has enhanced text handling, can retain or generate text in images, and supports multiple languages features limited or absent in the original.Nano Banana Pro can pull real-time information from Google Search to create dynamic visuals, while the original only works with static prompts.Pro can blend up to 14 objects or 6 high-fidelity photos and maintain consistent appearances for up to 5 characters, making it ideal for storyboards or presentations. The original lacks this level of compositional control.Pro includes SynthID AI watermarking for responsible use, visible sparkles for free/pro users, and optional removal for Ultra subscribers. The original had simpler watermarking or none.Pro is available on Gemini App, NotebookLM, Google Workspace, Search AI Mode, Flow, and via Gemini API, while the original was mainly limited to the Gemini App.Google’s Nano Banana Pro represents a major leap in AI image generation, combining the advanced reasoning of Gemini 3 with professional-grade visual tools. From higher-resolution images and multilingual text capabilities to real-time search integration and multi-image blending, the Pro version offers creators unprecedented flexibility. As the tool rolls out globally, it is poised to redefine the way professionals and enthusiasts alike generate and visualise content.","Google has officially launched nano banana pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular ai image generator.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting.

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

One Big Beautiful Bill

How it will affect Indians?





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced adjustments to certain H.R. 1 immigration-related fees for fiscal year (FY) 2026, reflecting inflation from July 2024 through July 2025.The new fees will take effect on January 1, 2026. Applicants submitting benefit requests postmarked on or after this date must include the updated fee.The fee increases were published in a Federal Register notice on July 22, according to the USCIS. Beginning in FY 2026 and continuing for each subsequent fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will adjust some H.R. 1 immigration-related fees for inflation, as specified in the legislation.Certain fees will remain unchanged in FY 2026. If there is any change, USCIS will publish future notices regarding inflationary adjustments for the immigration parole fee.Applicants are advised to review the updated fee schedule carefully to ensure they submit the correct payment with any benefit requests postmarked on or after January 1, 2026.The legal basis for the recent visa fee hikes stems from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025.The legislation consolidated multiple federal laws and introduced new rules across government agencies, including immigration. For visas, it established minimum fees for FY 2025 and mandated that future annual adjustments be linked to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The bill also introduced a “visa integrity fee” for non-immigrant visa applicants and raised fees on remittances, affecting immigrants sending money abroad.The fee increases will affect Indian applicants along with all other foreign nationals applying for US immigration benefits. Indians filing for asylum, Employment Authorization Documents, Temporary Protected Status, or other immigration-related benefits covered under H.R. 1 will need to pay the updated fees for any applications postmarked on or after January 1, 2026. The “visa integrity fee” for non-immigrant visa applicants and higher remittance fees will also impact Indians applying for visas or sending money abroad, meaning students, workers, and immigrants could face slightly higher costs for applications and transfers.",The us citizenship and immigration services (uscis) has announced adjustments to certain h.r. 1 immigration-related fees for fiscal year (fy) 2026.

This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.
