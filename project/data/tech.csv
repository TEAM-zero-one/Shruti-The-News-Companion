Govt: Refined consumption data helped defy the odds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-refined-consumption-data-helped-defy-the-odds/articleshow/121702338.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's updated consumption data significantly influenced World Bank's global benchmark and improved methods captured more actual spending, leading to a more realistic poverty line and lower poverty rate despite an increase in the threshold, govt said on Saturday.World Bank has announced a revision to global poverty estimates, raising the international poverty line from $2.15/day (2017 PPP) to $3.00/day (2021 PPP).

Viral Dubai chocolate gets desi spin. India can’t get knafeh of it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/viral-dubai-chocolate-gets-desi-spin-india-cant-get-knafeh-of-it/articleshow/121697009.cms,"Kochi-based Paul And Mike were one of the first to launch their own take

Sometimes, a global trend finds its sweetest home far from where it began. Ashmeet Singh Dua didn’t think a viral chocolate bar with a pistachio filling from Dubai would define his five-year-old Hyderabad-based dessert brand but the kunafa pistachio chocolate bar he introduced in Sept last year did just that. “It’s become our brand identity. In Hyderabad, people already love kunafa, so this was a hit the moment we launched it,” says the chef and founder of Xocolatl.If you haven’t heard of Dubai chocolate, you probably don’t have a sweet tooth. Inspired by the traditional Middle Eastern dessert knafeh (also called kunafa), it’s become such a craze that global pistachio prices started climbing and every chocolate brand launched its own versions. Indian brands too have put their spin on it.Dua’s take on the bar uses imported kataifi pastry for the crunch, house-roasted pistachio paste and a creamy filling. He’s got a range of flavours as well: nutella, lotus biscoff, salted caramel. “We’ve had celebrities try it and it’s our best-selling product even today. Unlike other dessert fads, this one’s here to stay,” he says.At Manam Chocolate, the award-winning craft chocolate brand from Hyderabad, the Dubai chocolate bar gets a layered, decadent spin.Called ‘The Kunafa Stack’, it brings together their house-made custard, tart bursts of fresh mulberries, pistachio cake crumbs with toasted granola and chopped dates. It’s topped with crisp pistachio kataifi and a scoop of house-made gelato, and a final flourish comes with a warm pour of molten Manam chocolate.Ruby Islam, head chef at Manam Chocolate, says The Kunafa Stack was launched during Ramzan this year. “I always look forward to creating unique experiences. But it’s also important to hear what people are asking for. When the Dubai Kunafa chocolate went viral, people started asking us if we had something with crunchy pistachio and milk chocolate.” The brand is opening a New Delhi outlet this month, where this version will be available.Mumbai’s French pastry shop Le15 Patisserie has also tapped into the Dubai chocolate trend. Founder Pooja Dhingra, aka the macaron queen, tried the famed bar in Dubai earlier this year and immediately understood the hype. “It was bold, sweet, crunchy and satisfying. But I knew I wanted to reimagine it through the lens of French pastry. A tart felt like the perfect format,” says Dhingra. Her kunafa chocolate pistachio tart, launched last month, features a buttery chocolate tart shell filled with pistachio cream, toasted kunafa and dark chocolate ganache topped with a pistachio macaron. Dhingra admits that viral trends come with their own set of expectations. “Trends push you to stay current and experiment, which is fun and keeps the creative energy high. But there is a pressure to constantly be ‘new’ and sometimes, that can feel more reactive than intentional,” she says.Kochi-based Paul And Mike’s bar has a golden kataifi pastry and a pistachio-rich filling. Founder and business head Vikas Temani says openness to global trends isn’t just philosophy — it’s now an operational reality. “What virality has done is really compress the product innovation cycle. We wanted to be the first among reputed Indian chocolate brands to launch this, so we did it real quick in terms of R&D and sourcing. That also gave us a window of no competition,” he says.As kataifi pastry is hard to find, home bakers in India have substituted the ingredients with what’s locally available. Some have used roasted sevaiya noodles to recreate that signature crunch. Arun Viswanathan of Chitra’m Craft Chocolates in Coimbatore didn’t want to replicate the trending Kunafa chocolate. Instead, he used a base of nool peni — a South Indian festive sweet made with fine strands of deep-fried dough, resembling delicate vermicelli, layered with ghee and powdered sugar — and cheekily named his bar Dubai Return, almost saying we’ve been there and come back with something of our own. The nool peni is layered with pistachio, saffron, rose and a touch of gulkand (rose petal preserve). “Nool peni has a flaky, crisp texture that reminds me of kunafa. So, I thought, why not reimagine the Dubai bar with it? Our Dubai Return is familiar, yet it surprises you,” says Viswanathan, who did his chocolate training in Belgium.Poetry by Love and Cheesecake, a cafe chain in Delhi, gave the trend a seasonal spin last month with their Chocolate Mango Kunafa Cheesecake. “We’ve never done anything like this before,” says chef Amit Sharma. “But after the Dubai chocolate went viral, people got curious—now we’re seeing repeat orders and planning more Kunafa experiments.”","Dubai chocolate with a pistachio filling has become a global craze. Every chocolate brand in india has launched their own version of the chocolate. Some have substituted the ingredients with what’s locally available. Manam chocolate, paul and mike and le15 patisserie are some of the brands that have tapped into the trend.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121697020,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-597587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Despite World Bank raising threshold, India achieves big dip in extreme poverty",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/despite-world-bank-raising-threshold-india-achieves-big-dip-in-extreme-poverty/articleshow/121700912.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade after the World Bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data in its June upgrade of the methodology.Based on the update, the latest World Bank data showed that the extreme poverty rate had declined from 27.1% in 2011-12 to 5.3% in 2022-23. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23. This would mean that nearly 270 million were lifted out of extreme poverty during the same period.In a blog, the World Bank said that the international poverty line for low-income countries has been raised to $3 per person per day from the existing $2.15 per person per day, and for lower middle-income countries it's changed from $3.65 to $4.20 per day and for upper middle-income countries it went up from $6.85 to $8.40.Given India's inflation rate, between 2017 and 2021, a revised extreme poverty line of $3 would constitute a 15% higher threshold than $2.15 expressed in 2021 prices and result in a 5.3% poverty rate in 2022-23. A new LMIC line of $4.20 would imply a 5% lower threshold for poverty than $3.65 adjusted in 2021 prices and yield a poverty rate of 23.9%, according to the World Bank.Using the new poverty line for low middle income countries (LMIC), which is at $4.20 per day per person, India's poverty rate fell to 23.9% in 2022-23 from 57.7% in 2011-12.The number of people in extreme poverty was down from 732.48 million in 2011-12 to 342.32 million in 2022-23, according to the data available on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform.Free and subsidised food transfers supported poverty reduction, and the rural-urban poverty gap narrowed. The five most populous states account for 54% of the extremely poor, it had said.According to the poverty and equity brief published by World Bank in April, extreme poverty (living on less than $2.15 per day) fell from 16.2% in 2011- 12 to 2.3% in 2022-23, lifting 171 million people above this line. Rural extreme poverty dropped from 18.4% to 2.8% , and urban from 10.7% to 1.1% , narrowing the rural-urban gap from 7.7 to 1.7 percentage points-a 16% annual decline.The poverty report had also said India has transitioned into the lower-middle-income category. Using the $3.65 per day LMIC poverty line, poverty fell from 61.8% to 28.1%, lifting 378 million people out of poverty. Rural poverty dropped from 69% to 32.5%, and urban poverty from 43.5% to 17.2%, reducing the rural-urban gap from 25 to 15 percentage points with a 7% annual decline, the April report had said.The updated World Bank data is expected to come as a shot in the arm for the govt and bolster its record of handling the economy and pursuing policies to push inclusive growth and lift millions out of poverty.Last year, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subhramanyam had indicated that the poverty level could be less than 5% based on preliminary estimates on the household consumption expenditure (HCES) data released by the statistics office.World Bank has said that in recent years, the scope and quality of information provided by household surveys has improved enormously, particularly in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, offering a clearer view into people's welfare and day-to-day lives.Several research papers have also indicated the reduction in extreme poverty over the last decade thanks to robust growth. A survey released last year estimated poverty to have declined to 8.5% from 21% in 2011-12 and pointed out that chronic poverty has come down but there is a significant proportion of people who can slip back into poverty due to ""accident of life"".World Bank, which introduced the international poverty line (IPL) in 1990, has undertaken several updates to include changing prices and costs, and the latest update was undertaken on June 5.The first update to IPL happened in 2001, with subsequent revisions in 2008, 2015, 2022, and more recently this month. This latest update, which also applies to the poverty lines for middle-income countries, follows the release last year of a new set of PPPs based on prices collected in 2021 by the International Comparison Programme.It also reflects changes in national poverty lines, which is a big reason for the increase, especially for the line that tracks extreme poverty, according to the World Bank.",India's extreme poverty rate has fallen sharply over the past decade. World bank updated its international poverty line definition and included updated data. The number of people living in extreme poverty also fell sharply during this period from 344.47 million in 2011-12 to 75.24 million in 2022-23.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121700951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-965504,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Dassault ties up with Tata to make Rafale fuselage in Hyderabad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dassault-ties-up-with-tata-to-make-rafale-fuselage-in-hyderabad/articleshow/121660357.cms,"Hyderabad unit to manufacture 'key structural sections' of Rafale

NEW DELHI: French aerospace major Dassault Aviation has tied up with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) to manufacture fuselage of Rafale fighters at Hyderabad, as part of the overall Rs 63,887 crore (almost ₹7 billion) deal inked by India in April to acquire 26 maritime variants of the omni-role jets.The inter-governmental deal, under which the 26 Rafale-M jets will be delivered in the 2028-2030 timeframe, had included the setting up of a production facility for fuselages as well as MRO facilities for aircraft engines, sensors and weapons in India.With the IAF first inducting 36 Rafales for Rs 59,000 crore and then the 26 Rafale-M jets for the Navy, the French fighter is the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Under the four production transfer agreements between Dassault Aviation and TASL, the Hyderabad facility will manufacture ""key structural sections"" of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section for India and global markets.""The first fuselage sections are expected to roll out in FY 2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month,"" a joint Dassault-TASL statement said on Thursday.""For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France. This is a decisive step in strengthening our supply chain in India. Thanks to the expansion of our local partners, including TASL, this supply chain will contribute to the successful ramp-up of the Rafale and, with our support, will meet our quality and competitiveness requirements,"" Dassault chairman Eric Trappier said.TASL CEO Sukaran Singh, in turn, said, ""This partnership marks a significant step in India's aerospace journey. It also reflects the remarkable progress India has made in establishing a modern, robust aerospace manufacturing ecosystem that can support global platforms.""

Is Xavier Legette's steamy kiss with GloRilla a PR stunt or a real love story in the making?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-xavier-legettes-steamy-kiss-with-glorilla-a-pr-stunt-or-a-real-love-story-in-the-making/articleshow/121687455.cms,"Xavier Legette is rumored to be dating Grammy-nominated rapper GloRilla (Getty Images)

What’s really going on between Xavier Legette and GloRilla after that passionate on-screen kiss?



GloRilla – Typa (Official Music Video)





NFL wide receiver Xavier Legette is used to making headlines with his performance on the field, but lately, it's his off-field moves that have fans buzzing. The Carolina Panthers’ rising star has stirred up major attention after appearing as rapper GloRilla’s love interest in her latest music video “Typa. ” From their sultry bedroom scenes to the chemistry they radiated on camera, fans are left wondering—are these two simply collaborators, or is there something more?Xavier Legette, known for his Southern charm, viral accent, and unapologetically bold style, isn’t new to the social media spotlight. But this time, it's not about his unique personality or his love for raccoons—yes, really—it’s about the steamy visuals shared with the Grammy-nominated rapper. Featured on the cover art of “Typa,” Legette is seen getting extremely close with GloRilla, setting the tone for a music video that’s intimate, eye-catching, and loaded with relationship rumors.In the video, which dropped Friday morning, the 24-year-old NFL wideout and the “Tomorrow” hitmaker take their roles beyond surface-level flirtation. At one point, GloRilla, clad in white lingerie, shares a passionate kiss with a shirtless Legette in what looks like a heated bedroom rendezvous.This scene—arguably the most talked-about part—has viewers speculating whether the duo's chemistry is strictly professional or crossing into something personal.Adding more intrigue to the storyline is R&B icon Keyshia Cole, who makes a cameo during a mid-video conversation with GloRilla. Given that “Typa” samples Cole’s classic track “Love,” her presence adds nostalgic weight and another layer of authenticity to the video. But for many, it’s Legette and GloRilla who have stolen the show.What has added fuel to the romantic speculation is the fact that neither GloRilla nor Legette has publicly addressed the nature of their relationship. Legette, who just wrapped a stellar rookie season with 49 receptions, nearly 500 receiving yards, and four touchdowns, has kept his personal life under wraps since his 2024 draft into the NFL. Similarly, GloRilla has rarely let fans in on her private affairs—until now.“The lyrics of ‘Typa’ talk about her love for a country man with, uh, other features (just listen for yourself),” which makes Legette a fitting choice for the role. Whether this is a savvy PR move blending music and sports for mutual clout, or the beginning of something genuine, remains to be seen. Either way, it’s one of the most talked-about crossovers of the year.So, is it all a calculated move or the spark of something real?

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, saudi arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its worldwide developers conference (wwdc) on monday, june 9.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s success secret revealed by his biographer: He is powered by fear of failing and that’s why he never slows down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-success-secret-revealed-by-his-biographer-he-is-powered-by-fear-of-failing-and-thats-why-he-never-slows-down/articleshow/121675759.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",N nvidia ceo jensen huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

Lucy Guo's OnlyFans' Rival Passes Controversy

A New Era for Women in Business

The world now has a new youngest self-made woman billionaire and she is a techie. Carnegie Mellon University dropout Lucy Guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon Taylor Swift , according to a recent Forbes report. Guo’s meteoric rise in the tech industry has positioned her as a trailblazer, highlighting the growing influence of women in entrepreneurship.Taylor Swift, previously recognized as the youngest self-made billionaire, has been dethroned by 30-year-old Lucy Guo. Swift, known for her chart-topping hits like Love Story and her business acumen in the music industry, held the title due to her massive earnings from music, tours, and endorsements. However, Guo’s innovative contributions to the tech world have now eclipsed Swift’s financial milestone.Lucy Guo’s ascent to billionaire status is largely attributed to her 5% stake in Scale AI , a data annotation firm she co-founded in 2016 with business partner Alexandr Wang. The company specializes in providing labeled data to train artificial intelligence applications, serving major clients in industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and e-commerce. Forbes estimates Guo’s net worth at $1.3 billion, driven by Scale AI’s soaring valuation.Guo is optimistic about the evolving landscape of entrepreneurship. In an interview with Forbes, she stated, “I think we’re about to see a lot more entrepreneurs be women and valuations grow at a tremendous rate. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else took the title next year, but it’s really exciting to see.” Her confidence reflects a broader trend of increasing diversity in the tech and business sectors.Despite her billionaire status, Guo maintains a surprisingly modest lifestyle. “I still live a very frugal lifestyle,” she shared with Forbes. “For lunch, I get ‘buy one get one free’ all the time or, like, the 50%-off deals. But the one day I decide I need a private jet, maybe I’ll sell some shares, but at the moment I’m very happy flying commercial.” This grounded approach sets her apart in a world often associated with extravagant spending.Addressing her new title, Guo expressed admiration for Taylor Swift, noting, “She has always struck me as someone that’s very pro-woman and wants other people to win. I am a huge fan of her; I think she’s an icon.” Guo’s comments highlight a mutual respect between the two, despite their competition for the billionaire title.Beyond Scale AI, Guo has ventured into other entrepreneurial pursuits, including co-founding Passes, a platform positioned as a rival to OnlyFans. Passes aims to empower content creators by offering a subscription-based model. However, the platform faced scrutiny earlier this year when a content creator filed a lawsuit alleging that Passes distributed sexually abusive material involving her while she was underage. The controversy has raised questions about the platform’s content moderation practices, though Guo has not publicly commented on the issue.Guo’s achievement marks a significant moment for women in tech and entrepreneurship. Her success with Scale AI and her forward-thinking approach to business underscore the potential for women to lead in high-growth industries. As Guo herself predicts, the coming years may see even more women breaking barriers and claiming top spots in the billionaire rankings.With her wealth, influence, and innovative mindset, Lucy Guo is poised to continue shaping the tech industry. Whether through Scale AI, Passes, or new ventures, her journey as a self-made billionaire is just beginning. As she told Forbes, the rapid pace of change in entrepreneurship means the title of youngest billionaire may soon pass to another visionary—potentially another woman pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.","Lucy guo has claimed the title of the world’s youngest self-made billionaire, surpassing pop icon taylor swift, according to a recent forbes report.

“

How the biodiesel is made: From waste to fuel

Lower Carbon Emissions : Because the oil originates from plants, its carbon output is largely offset by the carbon those plants absorbed, contributing to a near carbon-neutral cycle.





: Because the oil originates from plants, its carbon output is largely offset by the carbon those plants absorbed, contributing to a near carbon-neutral cycle. Less Air Pollution: It significantly reduces sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter—key urban pollutants.





Waste Management: It repurposes a major waste stream that would otherwise contaminate water or soil.





Economic & environmental gains with nationwide impact

Supply Volume Constraints: Collecting enough used oil consistently is a logistical challenge.





Infrastructure: Expanding processing capabilities requires investment.





Vehicle Compatibility: Not all engines are optimized for high biodiesel blends.





LuLu’s broader green vision

Plastic Waste Reduction: Over 90% reduction in plastic bag usage across stores, replaced by reusable alternatives.





Reverse Vending Machines: Installed in stores to encourage customers to recycle plastic bottles and cans, rewarding participation.





Green Logistics: Use of energy-efficient, green chiller vehicles for transporting fresh food, maintaining both food safety and emission reduction.





Eco Packaging: Rollout of biodegradable and reusable packaging.





Energy Efficiency: Adoption of energy effecient lighting and refrigeration across stores.



Community Outreach: Programs that promote environmental education and responsible consumption among customers and employees.





A model for UAE’s renewable future





LuLu Group, one of the UAE’s largest retail chains, has begun powering its delivery fleet with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected across its stores. This move is part of the company’s broader sustainability strategy and supports the UAE’s national vision of net-zero emissions by 2050.The initiative is the result of a strategic partnership with UAE-based clean energy company Neutral Fuels, which processes the used cooking oil into biodiesel. This low-emission fuel is now powering an increasing share of LuLu’s delivery trucks, directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions on UAE roads.In a statement, LuLu Group said,This proves that practical, everyday actions can lead to measurable environmental benefits without compromising efficiency or service.”The process begins with collecting used cooking oil from LuLu’s in-store kitchens, restaurants, food courts, and catering partners. The oil is filtered to remove food residues and then sent to processing plants where it undergoes transesterification, a chemical reaction involving methanol and a catalyst. This reaction produces two byproducts: biodiesel, and glycerin.Unlike conventional diesel, biodiesel made through this method is biodegradable and emits fewer harmful pollutants.According to LuLu, their fleet mostly uses blends of biodiesel to balance fuel performance and emissions reduction.The advantages are clear:Beyond the environmental benefits, the program has economic implications. By building a biodiesel supply chain, collection, cleaning, processing, and distribution, LuLu helps generate local green jobs. It also reduces reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to the UAE’s energy security.LuLu’s fleet plays a crucial logistics role across the UAE, transporting goods daily in dense urban areas. Switching to biodiesel has directly cut emissions in these high-traffic zones, making a noticeable difference in air quality and environmental impact.However, the path hasn’t been without hurdles:LuLu is addressing these issues by investing in research, building strategic partnerships, and ensuring quality standards are rigorously met before the fuel is used.Biodiesel is just one pillar of LuLu’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) efforts. Other key initiatives include:These programs reflect LuLu’s long-term commitment to environmental stewardship and community awareness.The UAE government has placed sustainability at the core of its Vision 2030 and 2050 Net Zero Strategy. Biodiesel from used cooking oil aligns with national priorities by enabling a circular economy and reducing emissions from key sectors like transport and retail.As the infrastructure for biodiesel grows and public awareness improves, other companies may follow LuLu’s lead. The LuLu-Neutral Fuels model is not just a corporate initiative, it’s a proof of concept for how sustainability and business efficiency can work hand in hand.",Lulu group has begun powering its delivery fleet with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected across its stores.
