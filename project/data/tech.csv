FASTag-based Annual Pass Benefits

Nitin Gadkari Vows US-Level Roads in 2 Years as India’s Highway Network Hits Global Milestone

FASTag-based Annual Pass announced! Road Transport and Highway Minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday announced the rollout of FasTag-based annual pass for users. The FASTag-based Annual Pass will cost users Rs 3,000, and will be effective from August 15, 2025. This pass, specifically created for private non-commercial vehicles including cars, jeeps, and vans, remains valid for either one year post-activation or 200 trips, depending on which milestone is reached first.The Annual Pass will facilitate efficient and economical travel on National Highways across India. Users will soon be able to activate and renew their passes through a dedicated section on the Rajmarg Yatra App and the official portals of NHAI and MoRTH, Gadkari said.Gadkari announced that the new FASTag-based Annual Pass will significantly benefit commuters by reducing costs and enabling seamless travel without halting at toll plazas.The scheme allows travellers to access 200 National Highway toll plazas for Rs 3,000 annually, a substantial reduction from the previous approximate cost of Rs 10,000.Speaking about the initiative, Nitin Gadkari said, ""The decision made by the government will provide great relief to the public.It will enable people to travel on a very large scale. Earlier, people had to pay a toll of at least Rs 10,000. Now, the new pass costs only Rs 3000, allowing for a validity of 200 trips annually. One trip means crossing one toll.""The minister highlighted that the revised system results in approximately Rs 15 per toll crossing, which is considerably lower than current rates, potentially saving frequent highway users up to Rs 7,000 annually.This initiative offers a solution to the ongoing issues regarding toll plazas within 60 km distances and streamlines toll payments into one affordable transaction. The Annual Pass is designed to enhance the travel experience for numerous private vehicle owners by reducing queuing time, alleviating traffic congestion, and minimising disagreements at toll collection points.Also Read | FASTag annual pass: How to purchase, validity, cost, trip limit & more - Top 15 FAQs answered In closed tolling highways such as Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, a single trip includes both entry and exit points, whilst on open tolling routes like Delhi-Chandigarh, each toll plaza crossing constitutes a separate trip. For closed tolling routes, toll collection occurs exclusively at exit points.Vehicle owners can recharge their accounts multiple times once they have utilised their 200-trip allocation. FASTag functions as a reloadable prepaid device that enables smooth passage of vehicles through toll booths using RFID technology. The system facilitates automatic withdrawal of toll fees from a connected prepaid account.Currently, commuters who frequently pass through a specific toll plaza can obtain monthly passes by submitting address verification and relevant documentation. These passes cost Rs 340 monthly, totalling Rs 4,080 annually.The Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had earlier this year indicated that his ministry is developing plans for car owner passes. Ministry officials consider this as a comprehensive solution to address various challenges, including public opposition to toll plazas within city limits, toll stations positioned closer than 60 km apart, and incidents of aggression at collection points.Statistics indicate that of the total Rs 55,000 crore toll revenue in 2023-24, private cars contributed only Rs 8,000 crore. Analysis of toll transactions reveals that whilst private cars account for 53% of total passages, they generate just 21% of the revenue.Additionally, private vehicles constitute about 60% of traffic between 6 am to 10 pm, whereas commercial vehicles maintain steady movement throughout the day and night periods.","The fastag-based annual pass will facilitate efficient and economical travel on national highways across india.

Brandon Aiyuk could be the star Patrick Mahomes needs

Patrick Mahomes has been waiting for a big-play receiver

The Kansas City Chiefs might be planning something big before the 2025 NFL season begins. On June 16, 2025, reports started coming out that the team could go after San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. He’s looking for a long-term deal, possibly worth $23 million per year. Such a move could potentially create a lot of avenues for the Kansas City Chiefs' offense and give quarterback Patrick Mahomes another powerful weapon. Nothing is done yet, but each day is bringing this closer. Fans are enjoying what will emerge next.Brandon Aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the San Francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns in his statistically best season as a professional. Brandon Aiyuk is fast, trustworthy, and consistently finds ways to beat defenders — in other words, he's the type of option Patrick Mahomes could use more of. The Kansas City Chiefs have not had a true top wide receiver since Tyreek Hill left town. If this deal goes through, it could reshape the AFC landscape and make the Chiefs even tougher to stop in the postseason.On June 16, 2025, Brandon Aiyuk posted a short video on TikTok saying, “They don’t want me back,” referring to the 49ers.That same day, ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on NFL Live, “If Brandon Aiyuk is truly available, the Chiefs will absolutely be in the mix.”Brandon Aiyuk is in the final year of his rookie contract, with a $14 million option. He wants a raise — close to $23 million a year. If the Kansas City Chiefs want to help Patrick Mahomes even more, this could be their chance. According to The Athletic, the team still has around $25 million in cap space. That gives them enough room to make the deal work if they want to.This offseason, Patrick Mahomes has been training in Missouri with a young group of wide receivers. Most of them are still learning, and while they’ve shown potential, none of them have the star power that Brandon Aiyuk brings.A player like Brandon Aiyuk could alleviate pressure on Patrick Mahomes, and make the Kansas City Chiefs’ offense much more dynamic. Training camp will start towards the end of July 2025. If a deal ever occurs before that, the team could go into the season with a brand new weapon ready to go.Adding Aiyuk could elevate the Chiefs’ offense with improved playmaking, balance, and versatility—bringing more explosiveness, precision, and leadership to the field. It wouldn’t just be a roster upgrade; it could reshape their entire offensive identity and Super Bowl path.Also Read: San Francisco 49ers GM John Lynch Breaks Silence On Brandon Aiyuk’s Return After ACL And MCL Tear Against Kansas City Chiefs","Brandon aiyuk, 26, was a big part of the san francisco 49ers' offense, compiling a 2023 season where he notched 75 catches, 1,342 yards, and 7 touchdowns.

Iran has reportedly went for a near-total Internet Blackout Tuesday (June 17) as conflict with Israel deepened. According to a report by NBC News, the drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran’s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. The report quotes Kentinc and Netblocks, the two companies that track global internet connectivity. According to NBC News, quoting these companies, Iran’s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians’ ability to access and share information with the outside world.The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks (VPNs) used to access foreign sites. Data published by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, reportedly said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.Iran’s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. In 2019, the country implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, reportedly said that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. He further said that app stores of Google and Apple -- Google Play Store and App Store -- had been blocked in Iran.A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran.What is not blocked in IranThe report said that Iran’s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran. As internet services are restricted in the country, some people have called for Elon Musk’s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in, the way it has in many parts of the world.","Iran has reportedly went for a near-total internet blackout tuesday (june 17) as conflict with israel deepened.

In a historic milestone in commercial space travel, SpaceX concluded its 500th mission with the Falcon family of rockets. The occasion was celebrated with the launch of 26 Starlink satellites from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base at 9:54 p.m. EDT on June 12, 2025. The mission not only represents technological excellence and reliability but also accentuates the transformation of a company that started its journey a little over a decade ago in a small garage.While the world witnessed Falcon rocket B1081 mark its 15th flight and come back successfully to a droneship off the coast of Southern California, the space community celebrated not just a launch, it was remembering SpaceX's evolution into a world leader in reusable space technology. With more than 7,600 satellites orbiting Earth and a frenetic mission cadence, SpaceX is redefining the playbook for space access, connectivity, and sustainability.As the aerospace community basked in the glow of the 500th Falcon mission, SpaceX founder Elon Musk commemorated the event with a nostalgic post on X. Posting a photo taken in 2006 of himself amidst early rocket parts in a humble garage, Musk captioned the photo:The photo was originally shot by Hans Koenigsmann, one of the original engineers at SpaceX, who posted:This photo was a powerful reminder of the company's humble roots. From a spare, garage-dwelling group of engineers pursuing the vision of space accessibility at a reasonable price, the company has grown into a company that has launched more space missions per year than any previous company in history.The June 12 launch was one of the regular missions for SpaceX's continuous Starlink program, an international satellite broadband internet initiative to provide high-speed broadband connectivity to remote and underserved communities across the globe. The 26 satellites launched on this mission contributed to the constellation of more than 7,600 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), further cementing Starlink's status as the largest satellite network ever constructed.Within an hour of the release, SpaceX verified successful deployment of the satellites. A congratulatory tweet from the company's official X (formerly Twitter) handle read:The 500-mission milestone demonstrates not just operational effectiveness, but also the scalability and reliability of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, which are the backbone of SpaceX's fleet.One of the main features of the mission was the utilization of Falcon 9 booster B1081, which flew for the 15th time. Having lofted the satellites to orbit, the booster successfully landed on autonomous droneship Of Course I Still Love You deployed in the Pacific Ocean.This recovery keeps SpaceX's high booster reuse rate trend going. While B1081's 15 flights are impressive, the single Falcon 9 booster flight record is currently 28, a record Musk will break in the near term. The company has consistently demonstrated the viability of its reusable approach, with reused boosters becoming a standard part of almost every launch.To date in 2025, SpaceX has launched 72 Falcon 9s, with 54 aimed at building out Starlink. Numerous satellites contain direct-to-cell functionality, enabling cell phones to get messages and limited internet services even without standard cellular systems.The path to 500 Falcon missions has not been without a few setbacks. SpaceX experienced several launch failures in its early life, including the first three failed Falcon 1 launches between 2006-2008. Success on the fourth Falcon 1 mission preserved the company from financial ruin.SpaceX has changed very quickly since then:With a mix of both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy missions, SpaceX has attained a mission cadence superior to national space agencies and private rivals alike.At the heart of SpaceX's success is its groundbreaking emphasis on reusability. Expendable, single-use rockets were the norm previously, making access to space expensive. By being able to recover and reuse Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy boosters, and fairings, SpaceX has reduced the cost of launch and boosted turnaround speed.The price of a Falcon 9 launch is estimated at less than $30 million much less than in the past launch vendors. This reduced cost facilitates high-frequency missions, deployment flexibility, and increased access to space-based services by governments and corporations.With more than 7,600 active satellites and growing, Starlink is a major player in the international internet scene. It is currently operational in over 70 nations with further rollout planned across the globe in 2025.Notably, new releases have also had direct-to-cell features, enabling certain smartphones to access satellites to provide fundamental services such as text messages and emergency notifications, perfect for far-flung regions and areas struck by disaster. SpaceX has teamed up with carriers in the United States such as T-Mobile, Australia's Optus, and Canada's Rogers for these types of services, essentially making itself a complementary telecom player. This shift could reshape traditional telecom models, especially in underserved rural and remote markets. As coverage expands, Starlink may become a global safety net for connectivity in times of crisis.As the Falcon family sets records, SpaceX is already looking toward the next frontier. The Starship program dedicated to deep space travel, lunar landing, and eventual colonization of Mars is the next chapter in SpaceX's quest.Starship-Super Heavy, the completely reusable system, successfully tested an orbital back in 2025, and the subsequent key test flight should happen later this year. Starship has been chosen by NASA to fly on its Artemis III mission returning humans to the Moon, solidifying SpaceX's position in future human space travel.In the meantime, the Falcon program remains the backbone of global launches, particularly for Starlink growth, commercial payloads, and crew flights to the International Space Station (ISS).SpaceX's 500th Falcon mission marks more than company success. It marks a disruption of the conventional aerospace model, compelling legacy participants such as Arianespace, ULA, and Roscosmos to evolve or be left behind. The company's reach now touches on:","Elon musk posts throwback to spacex’s garage days after the 500th falcon rocket launch.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.",N nvidia ceo jensen huang expressed sharp disagreement with anthropic ceo dario amodei ’s predictions about ai-driven job automation during a press briefing.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Reid Hoffman said, ""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Reid Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote in the post.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman believes young people should not fear ai.

Why Trump’s America-made T1 Mobile is a far-fetched reality



President Donald Trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, Trump Mobile, just weeks after threatening Apple and Samsung with steep tariffs unless they move production to the United States. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his ""America First"" manufacturing rhetoric while offering consumers a domestic alternative to foreign-made devices.Donald Trump's flagship device, the T1 Phone 8002 (Gold version), carries a $499 price tag and can be reserved with a $100 down payment for September delivery. The phone is marketed as ""designed and built in the USA,"" positioning it as the patriotic choice Trump has been demanding from major manufacturers.The launch comes after Trump's May threat to impose ""at least 25 percent"" tariffs on iPhones and similar devices manufactured overseas. He specifically targeted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating that iPhones sold in America must be manufactured domestically, not in India or elsewhere. Trump extended the tariff threat to ""Samsung and anybody that makes that product,"" as he told White House reporters, with implementation potentially beginning at the end of June. The timing appears designed to capitalize on his broader commitment to reshoring technology manufacturing.The T1 Phone 8002 boasts some impressive hardware for its price, including a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, 256GB storage, 12GB RAM, and a 5,000mAh battery. The device features three rear cameras led by a 50MP main sensor, Android 15, and notably includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rarity among modern smartphones.However, the Trump Mobile website doesn't tell much about the smartphone, and displays what appears to be heavily manipulated product images. No processor is listed despite a dedicated section on the specifications page, a critical omission for any smartphone launch.Industry observers note that the September delivery timeline seems optimistic given the typical 12-18 month development cycle for new smartphones. The Trump Mobile venture requires customers to place $100 deposits for pre-orders, with the remainder due upon delivery.Trump's assertion that the phone is manufactured domestically contradicts industry consensus about smartphone production capabilities in the United States. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that domestic iPhone production faces significant infrastructure and supply chain challenges.Currently, virtually no smartphone manufacturers, including those based in the US, produce their devices on American soil. The complex supply chains and specialized manufacturing capabilities required for modern smartphones remain concentrated in Asia, particularly China, despite ongoing efforts by companies like Apple to diversify production to countries like India.","Donald trump has unveiled his own smartphone brand, trump mobile.

Arun Srinivas responsibilities as Meta’s India head

What makes Arun Srinivas’ appointment crucial

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has appointed Arun Srinivas as its new managing director and head for India, effective July 1, 2025. A marketing veteran Srinivas will succeed Sandhya Devanathan, who has taken on an expanded role overseeing both India and Southeast Asia. Srinivas will continue to report directly to Devanathan in his new capacity.Commenting on Srinivas’s elevation, Sandhya Devanathan, Vice President (India and South East Asia), Meta, said, “As India continues to be at the forefront of economic growth and innovation, we are excited to have Arun at the helm of our efforts in this critical market. Meta in India is leading the way in AI adoption, WhatsApp, and Reels, and Arun’s impressive track record of building high-performing teams, driving product innovation, and fostering strong partnerships makes him the ideal leader to drive Meta’s continued investment in the country. He will continue to work closely with me as we scale the business in India.”Srinivas currently serves as Director and Head of Ads Business for Meta India, where he has led strategic initiatives across AI, Reels, and Messaging, working closely with top advertisers and agency partners. He joined Meta in September 2020, initially heading the Global Business Group in India. Under his leadership, Meta India's advertising revenue reportedly saw a significant increase in the last fiscal year.Arun Srinivas has nearly three decades of extensive experience across diverse sectors, including fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), technology, mobility, and private equity.Srinivas started his career as a product manager at Reebok in 1996.

AI Godfather’s urgent warning: Want job security? Learn plumbing

A personal warning from the AI Godfather

Office jobs face AI pressure, says ‘Godfather of AI’

Growing inequality could be the real problem

A future that’s still unwritten

In a world moving quickly toward automation, one of the creators of modern artificial intelligence is raising serious concerns about what happens next. Geoffrey Hinton , the British-Canadian computer scientist often called the “Godfather of AI,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk—and which ones might survive.Hinton, who helped lay the foundation for AI systems that now power everything from chatbots to medical tools, left his role at Google in 2023. Since then, he’s been speaking more freely about the risks of the technology he helped create. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett, Hinton discussed the future of work in a world shaped by powerful machines. And in a surprising turn, he said there’s one career path that may be safer than most: plumbing.While talking about the risks of AI, Hinton made a simple point: machines are good at thinking, not at fixing pipes. “It’s going to be a long time before [AI is] as good at physical manipulation as us,” he said. “A good bet would be to be a plumber.”Plumbing is hard to automate. It involves manual skill, real-world judgment, and problem-solving in unpredictable settings. A plumber might need to crawl under a sink, deal with unusual water pressure, or fix something without a manual. These aren’t tasks AI systems are built to handle.According to Hinton, jobs that rely on hands-on skills are less likely to be taken over by AI anytime soon. While machines can handle large amounts of data and even draft documents, they still can’t climb ladders or tighten valves. That gives trade jobs—especially ones like plumbing, electrical work, and carpentry—an edge in the AI era.Now 77, Hinton didn’t try to hide how conflicted he feels. He admitted that he’s still processing the full consequences of his work. “Intellectually, you can see the threat,” he said. “But it’s very hard to come to terms with it emotionally.”He said he worries about the future his children and grandchildren might face. In the interview, he painted a picture that was both realistic and unsettling. He talked about a world where AI systems could eventually control power plants and critical infrastructure. If these systems become fully independent, they may not need people at all.“If AI ever decided to take over,” he warned, “it would need people for a while to run the power stations—until it designed better analog machines… There are so many ways it could get rid of people, all of which would, of course, be very nasty.”Hinton didn’t say this will happen. But he made it clear that it could. And in his view, that’s reason enough to take it seriously.While plumbers may be safe for now, Hinton believes many office jobs won’t be. He pointed to legal assistants and paralegals as some of the first roles being reshaped by AI.These jobs often involve reviewing contracts, analyzing documents, or summarizing information—all tasks that large language models can already handle. With AI tools now able to draft legal text and even predict case outcomes, the need for human support roles in law firms could shrink.Hinton wasn’t trying to be dramatic. He was simply stating what the data shows. “In a society which shared out things fairly, everybody should be better off,” he said. “But if you can replace lots of people by AIs, then the people who get replaced will be worse off.”In other words, the shift may boost productivity, but it might not help everyone equally.Beyond the risks of job loss, Hinton pointed to a deeper issue: inequality. As companies adopt AI, many workers may be pushed out, while only a small group—those who own or run these companies—stand to benefit.If not managed carefully, this could lead to a wider gap between rich and poor. People in manual jobs may still find work, but others—especially those in mid-level white-collar roles—may struggle to adapt.And while AI might create new jobs, Hinton warned that the pace of change could be too fast for many to keep up.Hinton’s message wasn’t meant to scare people. It was meant to make them think. He didn’t claim to know how the future will unfold. But he said it’s time to have an honest conversation about what’s coming.For now, the most valuable skills may not be digital ones—but physical ones. Fixing a leak, rewiring a switchboard, or installing a water heater might be harder to replace than people think.And that’s something worth remembering.","Geoffrey hinton, the “godfather of ai,” has made a rare public statement about what kinds of jobs are most at risk.

AI spending drives cost-cutting measures

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily targeting its sales division, with the cuts expected to be announced in early July as the company continues restructuring amid massive AI investments, according to people familiar with the matter.The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.Microsoft's layoffs reflect the broader challenge facing tech companies balancing AI investments with operational efficiency. The company has allocated roughly $80 billion for data center spending this fiscal year while executives have pledged to Wall Street to control costs in other areas.CEO Satya Nadella recently described earlier cuts as a ""realignment"" rather than performance-based decisions, telling employees at an internal town hall that ""this was not about people failing. It was about repositioning for what comes next.""The timing follows a pattern for Microsoft, which often announces organizational changes near the end of its fiscal year. The company previously eliminated 10,000 positions in January 2023 after pandemic-driven hiring, and made additional cuts to its videogame division following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.Microsoft declined to comment on the planned layoffs, with the final number of cuts still being determined according to sources familiar with the matter.","Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs, with the cuts expected to be announced in early july.
