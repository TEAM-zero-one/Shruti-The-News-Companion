India's natural gas consumption to rise 60% by 2030 under 'Good to Go' scenario,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-natural-gas-consumption-to-rise-60-by-2030-under-good-to-go-scenario/articleshow/120171022.cms,"India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030, pushed by growing demand in the city gas distribution (CGD) sector and increased use across transport, cooking, and industry.A new study by the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PNGRB) revealed that daily gas consumption are likely to rise from 188 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in 2023–24 to 297 mmscmd by 2030 under the “Good-to-Go” scenario.This scenario assumed moderate economic growth and policy progress in line with current trends and government commitments. Looking further ahead, demand is projected to reach 496 mmscmd by 2040 under the same scenario.However, under a more optimistic “Good-to-Best” outlook, factoring in favourable policies, faster development, and greater investments, consumption could jump to 365 mmscmd by 2030 and hit 630 mmscmd by 2040.The CGD sector, which includeds supplying compressed natural gas (CNG) to vehicles and piped natural gas to homes and businesses, is set to be the biggest driver of demand. It is expected to account for 50 mmscmd of the 110 mmscmd incremental demand by 2030 and 129 mmscmd of the 198 mmscmd increase between 2030 and 2040 in the moderate growth scenario.“The CGD sector is expected to be the primary growth driver, with consumption projected to grow 2.5 to 3.5 times by 2030 and 6 to 7 times,” the study noted.India is targeting a rise in the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030, up from the current 6–6.5 per cent, as part of its efforts to shift towards cleaner energy and meet net-zero emission goals by 2070.So far, the PNGRB has awarded city gas licences covering 307 geographical areas (GAs), extending gas infrastructure to most parts of the country.Refineries and the petrochemical sector are also expected to see a rise in gas usage, helped by a growing focus on petrochemical integration. This sector is projected to account for an additional 21 mmscmd of gas demand by 2030, and another 10 mmscmd by 2040.While growth in power generation and fertiliser usage is expected to be moderate, given existing high consumption levels, the transition towards cleaner energy is expected to keep gas relevant in both sectors.India currently imports around half of its gas needs, a reliance that is set to increase as demand outpaces domestic production. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports are projected to more than double by 2030.The study highlights the potential of LNG in reducing diesel usage in long-haul transport, noting, “LNG as a long-haul transportation fuel could be a game changer, with the potential to play a pivotal role in replacing diesel. LNG trucking is projected to gain momentum post 2030, with the potential to emulate China’s success in reducing diesel dependency,” PTI quoted.With global LNG supply expected to increase, the report suggests this could present India with an opportunity for long-term supply deals at more competitive prices.However, the PNGRB warned that several risks remain. “Achieving India’s projected natural gas targets for 2030 and 2040 will require a continued commitment from entities towards infrastructure expansion, favourable LNG pricing, and conducive policies,” the study said. “However, geopolitics, policy uncertainty, and volatility in gas prices cannot be ignored.”From 2015-16 to 2023-24, India’s natural gas consumption rose by 45 per cent, from 131 mmscmd to 188 mmscmd. While power sector demand contracted slightly due to sensitivity to price changes, CGD usage more than doubled, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12 per cent. The fertiliser sector saw 3.4% annual growth, while the refinery sector posted 1.8 per cent.","India’s natural gas consumption is expected to climb by nearly 60 per cent by 2030. The city gas distribution (cgd) sector is set to be the biggest driver of demand. Cgd usage more than doubled, with a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of 12 per cent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120171083,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93762,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. She stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.",Kayla nicole opened up on her new podcast the pre-game.

Tom Brady and Tiger Woods support wild project that brings iconic dire wolf back from extinction



In an achievement that sounds more like a storyline from Jurassic Park than real life, Colossal Biosciences has pulled off a remarkable scientific feat—resurrecting the dire wolf , a species believed to have vanished over 10,000 years ago. Known for their legendary size and strength, these creatures once roamed North America and were popularized in pop culture by HBO's Game of Thrones . Today, they are living and breathing again, thanks to the audacious vision of Colossal Biosciences.The Dallas-based biotechnology firm, founded by Ben Lamm, has emerged as a trailblazer in de-extinction science . But Lamm is clear about their mission. “We’re not a foundation, we’re not a nonprofit, we are not an academic think tank. We are trying to actually develop products and build technologies,” he told ABC News. This is a company driven not only by innovation but by the desire to reshape the future of genetics.The dire wolf resurrection was accomplished through cutting-edge genetic engineering. The team, led by Colossal’s chief scientist Beth Shapiro, extracted viable DNA from ancient fossils—a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull. These fragments were essential for sequencing the dire wolf genome. With DNA from close relatives like the gray wolf serving as a biological base, scientists rewrote the genetic code and created embryos that were implanted into domestic dog surrogates.In October, Romulus and Remus—the first male dire wolves—were born. They were followed by Khaleesi, a female named after the famed Game of Thrones character, in January. ""I had all the confidence that this was going to work,"" Shapiro said, underlining the precision and optimism that fueled this historic moment.Backing this revolutionary project are some of the world’s biggest names. From NFL legend Tom Brady to golf icon Tiger Woods, and even Hollywood stars like Paris Hilton and director Peter Jackson, Colossal’s investor roster reads like a who's who of global influence. Brady, a member of the company's cultural advisory board, shared his pride on Instagram: ""So proud of the team for the hard work, passion, and countless hours that have gone into this project!!!""The dire wolf isn’t the only animal Colossal is reviving. Earlier this year, they unveiled the “woolly mouse,” a genetically modified mouse with thick fur reminiscent of the woolly mammoth—another species the company hopes to bring back by 2028. Red wolves, currently critically endangered, were also successfully cloned by the team.With goals to restore extinct creatures like the dodo bird and Tasmanian tiger on the horizon, Colossal Biosciences is turning science fiction into science fact. As CEO Ben Lamm put it: ""This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works.""And as it turns out, the rebirth of the dire wolf may only be the beginning of a new era—where extinction is no longer forever.Also Read: NFL star Puka Nacua already has post-retirement plans—overseas basketball might be his next move","Dallas-based biotechnology firm colossal biosciences has pulled off a remarkable scientific feat.

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Trump tariffs put pause on startups' IPO plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-tariffs-put-pause-on-startups-ipo-plans/articleshow/120186751.cms,"MUMBAI: The market downturn triggered by Trump tariffs have not only upset startups' IPO plans - pushing timelines by at least one to two quarters - the subdued sentiment has also spilled over to private markets where deals are stuck over valuation concerns.Investors are sitting on enough capital and big private equity (PE) funds are scouting for startup investments, but the correction in public markets have led them to renegotiate valuations, delaying closure of sizable deals, fund managers, investment bankers and consultants told TOI. This means that startups in need of funding will have to settle for lower valuations and those who are raising pre-IPO capital will have to make peace with flat valuations. Even as the US has announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for countries barring China, uncertainty about the global macro environment persists, leading to investor caution.""On an average, funds are yet to deploy 25%-30% of the capital they have raised earlier and also new funds are being raised. But valuations are being negotiated for deals that are in the works. If public markets continue to remain subdued, the first leg of discussions will keep getting delayed.Companies that are in need of urgent capital will have to compromise on valuation multiples,"" said Mehekka Oberoi, fund manager at IIFL Fintech Fund. Investors are back on the table but pricing is a concern, said Amit Ramchandani, CEO and head of investment banking at Motilal Oswal Financial.Had valuations not been an issue, the flow of big funding deals ($100 million and beyond) would have been higher given that private markets are more attractive at this juncture, said Amit Nawka, partner at PwC. ""The market is ripe for growth deals but the question is when will public markets recover? Because public markets have taken a beating, valuations to enter large private deals will be questioned,"" Nawka said. Over the past few months, PE players like KKR and Kedaara Capital have become active in the startup space-earlier this week fintech Juspay bagged $60 million in funding led by Kedaara Capital while KKR bought stake in Rebel Foods through a secondary transaction in Dec. ""While overall India remains attractive for investors and startups, some tempering of valuations could be expected in select mid to growth stage deals and the stringent evaluation by investors will continue,"" said Aditya Shukla, partner at Bain & Company.From a broader perspective, the private markets currently look better and overall funding (including big deals) should pick up pace in the months to come, investors said. ""The IPO window is shut for now and listing activity is poised to be significantly lower this year. Rational valuations in private markets should fuel funding in the unlisted space,"" said Shapath Parikh, co-founder at White Whale Partners.","Investors are sitting on enough capital and big private equity (pe) funds are scouting for startup investments.

Kelce brothers slam NFL’s Hawk-Eye deal: First-down tech or corporate PR play?



Brandon Graham on Retirement, Rookie Jason Stories, Art of Trash Talking & The Brady Sack | EP 133

The NFL ’s decision to ditch the traditional chain crew and usher in Sony’s Hawk-Eye technology for measuring first downs has sparked mixed reactions—but none quite as raw or revealing as those shared by Jason and Travis Kelce . On their latest New Heights podcast episode, the Kelce brothers dug into the controversial change, and things got hilariously heated—especially when the conversation veered into what this move might really be about.The new tech, which is set to debut in the 2025 season, promises enhanced precision using a camera-based virtual measurement system, something sports like tennis and cricket have relied on for years. But according to the Kelces, the timing and branding of the change raise more questions than answers—especially in the wake of one specific moment from last season.That infamous play happened during the AFC Championship Game between the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs. With a crucial fourth-and-1 at Kansas City’s 41-yard line, Josh Allen went for a quarterback sneak. While replays appeared to show Allen’s body across the line, the placement of the ball—buried deep in a pile of players—led to differing opinions from officials. The call on the field stood: no first down. Buffalo turned it over, and the Chiefs capitalized with a touchdown on the next drive.That moment still haunts Bills fans—and Jason Kelce believes it’s the very reason the NFL introduced this new tech. “Everyone is jumping to the conclusion, the Bills game against you guys. Where it looked like Josh Allen was ahead of the first down marker,” Jason said. His younger brother, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, pushed back hard: “I don’t think it looked like it. You could only assume that where the ball was in his arm, that it may have, but you couldn’t tell exactly.”Jason, undeterred, insisted, “All I’m saying is that this rule is here, by and large, because of that play.” Travis, in classic fashion, wasn’t buying the official explanation and dropped a theory that had Jason spiraling into laughter and disbelief: “I think this is just a big Sony endorsement. I think everybody’s going to be talking about Sony hawk-eye virtual measurement system, and this is just a big plug for Sony.”Jason’s agreement was unexpectedly blunt. “You’re 1000 percent right,” he said. “There’s no f--ing way it would be called the Sony Hawk-Eye system unless Sony paid out the ass.” His frustration wasn’t about the tech, but how the NFL was selling it. “Just say it’s a virtual measuring system. Don’t f--ing sell me Sony.”While the league claims the upgrade is all about improving “accuracy, consistency and efficiency,” the Kelce brothers made one thing clear—this move feels more like a brand deal than a response to officiating controversy. And with the NFL already facing fan suspicions of being overly scripted, attaching a corporate label to an in-game decision system only fans the flames.“Sorry, NFL, didn’t mean to blow your cover,” Travis quipped with a smirk, perfectly summing up the skepticism many fans now share.Also Read: Top NFL draft prospect Isaiah Bond turns himself in to police on shocking sexual assault warrant","Kelce brothers slam nfl’s hawk-eye deal: first-down tech or corporate pr play?

Prada to buy Versace for nearly $1.4billion to form an Italian fashion powerhouse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prada-to-buy-versace-for-nearly-1-4billion-to-form-an-italian-fashion-powerhouse/articleshow/120184520.cms,"On Thursday, in the biggest luxury deal of the year, Prada announced it was buying Versace for 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from Capri Holdings, a beleaguered New York group that at one point styled itself as the American answer to the great fashion groups of France.The deal is a sign of faith in the continued value of Made in Italy at a time when financial markets are in chaos because of Trump's policies. And it marks the end of Capri's attempt to create an American luxury group to rival LVMH and Kering, while signaling an attempt by Prada to create an Italian competitor to the powerhouses.Versace will join Prada and Miu Miu, as well as Luna Rossa, America's Cup sailing team, and pastry brand Marchesi as part of Prada Group, creating a ""best in class"" mosaic of Italian savoir-faire. It also gives Prada Group 's fashion holding critical mass, adding a ready-to-wear brand with a different identity to those of Miu Miu and Prada - as well as one that is not dependent on designer Miuccia Prada - to the mix. Prada CEO Andrea Guerra said the acquisition would add, ""a new dimension, different and complementary,"" to the group. ""The journey will be long,"" he added.Prada and Versace are, on the surface, a study in contrasts. Versace made its name on a celebration of flash and fantasy, reveling in sun, sex, the male gaze and the tightrope between bad taste and elegance. Prada, by contrast, embraced a contrarian exploration of the meaning of femininity, gender politics and strange allure of ugly chic. But, Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli said, ""we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftsmanship and heritage,"" and an understanding of consumer power of brand semiology - the upside triangle, medusa head - and a belief in the importance of family.Miuccia Prada is close to Donatella Versace, who stepped in to run the company her late brother Gianni founded in 1997; though Versace left her position as chief creative officer last month, she is ""delighted' to have her brand back in family hands.",Prada announced it was buying versace for 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) the deal is a sign of faith in the continued value of made in italy.

Poll Is it ethical for tech companies to collaborate with military organizations? No, it promotes violence. Yes, it's part of national defense.

A former Microsoft employee ignited controversy during the company’s 50th anniversary celebration, confronting top executives including CEO Satya Nadella and former heads Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. The employee, Vaniya Agrawal, an Indian-American software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in Gaza through its technologies.“Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood,” she declared before being escorted out of the event. Neither Gates nor Nadella nor Ballmer responded to the outburst, choosing instead to continue their panel discussion.Agrawal, who has since resigned from the company, described Microsoft as a “digital weapons manufacturer” and condemned its alleged collaboration with the Israeli military. In a pointed critique, she called on Microsoft to end its ties with Israel, highlighting what she claimed was a $133 million agreement with Israel’s Ministry of Defense involving AI and Azure tools.In her resignation letter, Agrawal wrote, “I cannot, in good conscience, be part of a company that participates in this violent injustice,” and added, “If you must continue to work at Microsoft, I urge you to use your position, power, and privilege to hold Microsoft accountable to its own values and mission.”This isn’t the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company's partnerships. Earlier, Ibtihal Aboussad, another staffer who also resigned, disrupted a session led by Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO. She called him a “war profiteer,” accusing him and the company of enabling violence. “Microsoft technologies are being used to commit acts of genocide,” she alleged. Suleyman responded, “Thank you for your protest. I hear you.”Back in February, Nadella faced similar internal dissent when five employees were removed from a meeting after protesting Microsoft’s contracts with Israeli defense entities. The backlash has intensified in recent months as violence surged in Gaza following the breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.","Vaniya agrawal, an indian-american software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in gaza through its technologies.
